Climate Change: The Facts 2020 is the thinking sceptic's guide to the climate change debate
There is a big "what if" buried at the heart of Climate Change: The Facts 2020. What if nature has a special way of using the sun, cosmic rays, water vapour and clouds to regulate the temperature of the planet? What if these processes have already been explored but too hastily dismissed? Do they deserve a closer look?
When Jennifer Marohasy sat down to conceive the latest in a series of climate change publications for the Institute of Public Affairs she was determined to remain faithful to the scientific method and be guided by past experience.
In her view, the history of science suggests you don't actually replace a theory until you come up with another possible explanation.
"Rebuttals don't cut it unless you have an alternative," Maro-hasy says. The result is Climate Change: The Facts 2020, which can be alternatively described as a thinking sceptic's guide to climate.
The fourth in a high-selling series by the IPA and the second edited by Marohasy, the book deals with a wide range of hot topics from bushfires to sea levels, polar bears, volcanoes and temperature records.
It brings together a wide range of Australian and international voices including polar bear specialist Susan Crockford, investigative journalist Donna Laframboise and satellite temperature measurement pioneer Roy Spencer. The book's true ambition, however, is captured in the contributions of atmospheric physicists Richard Lindzen and Henrik Svensmark and well known Australian contrarian Peter Ridd.
Lindzen, Svensmark and Ridd each deal with some of the most contentious issues in climate change science, the role of clouds and the sun.
Rather than break new ground each presents a fresh view of established work that has proved difficult for the climate change establishment to accept.
Together, Marohasy argues, the contributions go to the core of anthropogenic climate change theory and "give the book longer term currency".
According to Svensmark, since low clouds are very important for the radiative energy balance of the Earth - by reflecting incoming radiation back to space and in this way casting a shadow - they can cool the Earth's atmosphere.
He argues it is changes in cosmic-ray flux modulated by the sun and the position of our solar system relative to exploding stars in other galaxies that will drive this. There is no role for carbon dioxide in Svensmark's theory of climate change.
His leads to the conclusion that a microphysical mechanism involving cosmic rays and clouds is operating in the Earth's atmosphere, and that this mechanism has the potential to explain a significant part of the observed climate variability over the history of the Earth.
Ridd revisits the pioneering work of Joanne Simpson, who studied cloud formation and tropical thunderstorms, and how they could result in tremendous amounts of energy transfer from the Earth's surface to the top of the troposphere - where it can be radiated into space.
Simpson is a legend in the meteorological community of the US. She was awarded the American Meteorological Society's 1983 Carl-Gustav Rossby Research Medal - the highest award in atmospheric sciences. But her climate change theory is not included in the dominant view or models.
Ridd builds on the mathematics laid out by Simpson and Herbert Riehl back in 1958 and likens the process to the pistons in a car engine. His punchline is that this huge atmospheric engine helps cool the surface atmosphere.
Applying some mathematics, Ridd shows that more greenhouse gases in the lower atmosphere can make the heat engine more powerful. In short, Ridd demonstrates that with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the lower atmosphere, air temperatures can increase and thus raise the water vapour content of the air if this occurs over tropical oceans.
Ridd calculates that for every 1C rise in tropical temperature, the heat transfer by the convection pathway will increase by 10 per cent.
Lindzen, meanwhile, has focused his research on high altitude cirrus clouds and their heating effect on the environment because they reflect infra-red radiation back to Earth. Lindzen makes the analogy with the pupils in our eyes changing size relative to how bright or dim the light is.
Specifically, Lindzen has hypothesised that as the atmosphere warms from increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases, the area of cirrus cloud decreases, providing a negative feedback as more infra-red radiation is able to escape into space.
Both Lindzen and Ridd hypothesise that there are cloud-related negative feedback loops in place that will mitigate the potential effects of increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases on Earth's temperature.
Neither of them deny the potential for greenhouse gases, especially water vapour and CO2, to warm the Earth. Rather they explain that because of the complexity of the physical processes at work, in particular, and the role clouds play in facilitating negative (cooling) feedbacks, the Earth is unlikely to overheat.
The ideas presented in the book are complex and counterintuitive to the dominant narrative of a world hurtling towards climate catastrophe because of carbon dioxide. And for this Marohasy is unapologetic.
"We live at a time when climate change is deemed a morally important issue," Marohasy says.
It is claimed that greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels are causing unprecedented and potentially catastrophic warming of the Earth's atmosphere, she argues.
"Those who disagree with this claim, or who ask for more evidence, are generally labelled 'deniers' of climate change," Marohasy says.
"In reality, the dispute is not whether the climate changes; it is what causes the change (could it be mostly natural rather than human-caused), and whether the current rate and magnitude of change is unusual." The book is a two-finger salute to what US president Dwight Eisenhower might have called "the climate-industrial complex". In his farewell address, in a television broadcast on January 17, 1961, Eisenhower warned about the dominance, or the "capturing", of science-based public policy by what he called a "scientific-technological elite".
Marohasy argues it is this same elite who have dictated climate-change policies for some decades now, with wide-ranging economic implications.
"Many people may prefer their 'facts' to be short and to the point," Marohasy says in the book's introductory chapter.
"But climate science is complicated and, despite the considerable expenditure on research, our understanding of the atmosphere is far from complete." Marohasy says she has no doubt that if we had a properly constructed theory of climate, scientists would be able to better forecast droughts, floods and bushfires. There would be less fear of catastrophic sea-level rise, and more curiosity rather than despair when it comes to polar bears and penguins. Climate Change: The Facts 2020 is available from October 8.

Media Watch's climate change obsession

The ABC show sets itself up as judge, but fails the test of balance itself
Like a judge turned advocate, or umpire turned player, the ABC's Media Watch has become a -spruiker in one of the nation's most crucial policy debates - -climate change.
Jonathon Holmes, a former presenter and columnist for The Age, this week trumpeted his fondness for renewable energy and disinterest in the cost of electricity.
Defending Bill Shorten's uncosted promise to deliver 50 per cent of Australia's electricity from renewable sources by 2030, Holmes said "no one has a clue what the comparative cost of coal-fired and renewable energy will be by 2030." He also argued that renewables "create at least as many - arguably far more" jobs than coal-fired -electricity and that News Corporation Australia (publisher of The Weekend Australian) has launched an "assault on climate change -action." He is free to subscribe to whatever ill-founded conspiracy theory he likes, of course, and The Age is perfectly entitled to publish them.
But it would be a shame if he had used his pulpit at Media Watch to promote Leunig Left views.
Holmes fronted Media Watch from 2008 until 2013 when he was replaced by Paul Barry.
Over that period climate policy has been one of the nation's most contentious political, economic and environmental issues: Labor's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was proposed, rejected and then dropped; the Coalition switched from supporting emissions trading schemes to opposing them; Labor ruled out a carbon tax then introduced one; the Coalition repealed it; and now Labor again proposes a trading scheme and the ambitious renewables target.
A quick check of Barry's Twitter feed shows he shares the -climate alarmist and renewable-at-any-cost stance of his predecessor (along with a healthy dose of Murdochophobia).
Views such as these might be economically naive and politically jaundiced but they are common enough among university activists and Greens politicians, so we can hardly get too excited about Barry subscribing to them.
But what if this Green Left push infiltrated the professional posture of senior journalists at the national broadcaster?
What if Media Watch - a program the ABC says aims to expose "conflicts of interest, misrepresentation and manipulation" - was used to consistently promote a climate alarmist and pro-renewables mindset?
This week, Media Watch returned to an old theme when it picked up commentators using an erroneous figure relating to the high cost of wind and solar energy over coal.
The mistake inflated the costs by a factor of 10 (so was most likely the result of a misplaced decimal point). It occurred in this newspaper's Cut&Paste section more than four years ago and was -corrected.
Given the incorrect figures made wind power 19 times more expensive than coal, "you'd have to be mad to support it (wind -energy)," Barry mocked.
Yet the correct figures showed wind was twice as expensive as coal and that solar is more than five times the cost - so the pertinent question might be whether you would be mad to support renewables on those numbers?
Barry didn't make that point or pose that question.
Far from being a binary emotional question about "belief" in climate change and "love" for renewables, climate policy involves a complex serious of competing objectives to reduce emissions, contain costs and support economic growth.
Every cost needs to be measured against a desired benefit, and each goal needs to be weighed against the known costs.
Aside from this newspaper, and perhaps the Australian Financial Review, few media organisations have looked at these issues seriously.
The Australian has long accepted the scientific basis of anthropogenic climate change, understanding the need to reduce CO2 emissions and, for a quarter of a century, has argued for an economically rational market mechanism to deal with it.
At the same time it has fostered an intelligent debate, including reportage of changing climate observations and modelling, and rational analysis of various climate factors and proposed solutions.
Media Watch has shown something of an obsession for pursuing coverage of climate change issues and, in particular, reportage in The Australian.
Its executive producer, Tim Latham, declined to provide a tally of how often the program had criticised coverage of dissenting or sceptical climate views compared to reports showing alarmist overreach. He did, however, point out a segment from March last year, which appears to be the exception that proves the rule.
It highlighted media reports of a climate change study that found the Sydney Opera House would be swamped by rising sea levels.
Mocking the sensational nature of the reporting, Media Watch pointed out the study was looking at consequences 2000 years into the future.
"The Sydney Opera House will not be submerged in the next 100 or 200 years if indeed it ever is," lectured Barry, "and to imply that it will be is alarmist nonsense of the sort that brings journalism and -climate science into disrepute." Yet, of course, it was the study that was sensational. It claimed more than one per cent of the global land mass, 7 per cent of the world's population and 136 UNESCO world cultural heritage sites would be swamped - in 2000 years.
If anyone was bringing climate science into disrepute surely it was these climate scientists themselves.
The study generated exactly the sort of media reporting intended. Typically, Media Watch analyses, corrects, criticises, crosschecks and mocks journalists and commentators who give oxygen (pun intended) to scientists or activists making dissenting or sceptical arguments about global warming.
The alarmist scaremongering and frightening predictions of climate activists that are regurgitated daily by a wide variety of media organisations, especially Fairfax and the ABC, are seldom subjected to scrutiny.
When the national broadcaster publishes claims such as this - "That's over 2 billion atomic bombs worth of heat built up on our planet since 1998" - Media Watch doesn't spring into action to question the language.
Tim Flannery's predictions about permanent drought and dams running dry sit stubbornly unfulfilled and inexplicably unexamined on ABC websites.
Instead of pointing out the jaundice, Media Watch replicates it and continues its crusade against sceptics.
Often that effort has been directed at this newspaper's environment editor, Graham Lloyd, who is a committed environmentalist, accepts the physics of climate science and has opined in favour of an emissions trading scheme but dares to report a wide range of scientific analysis.
"The fundamental point," says Lloyd, "is just because I don't agree with something doesn't mean it should not be put into the public domain where it can sharpen debate and understanding.
"The alternative is self-censorship and authoritarian control." In extensive and diverse coverage of data, developments and opinions on climate issues over countless stories and many years there is one story (sourced from overseas, misinterpreted in the production process and for which The Australian published a correction) that would have been better left unpublished.
But the rest of Media Watch's numerous admonishments amount to little more than a misplaced decimal point here, a less than ideal headline there, or nitpicking about the emphasis given to particular points of view in -various reports.
It is beyond contention The Australian and The Weekend Australian have covered a broader array of scientific and economic analysis and opinion on climate than the ABC.
Take the hiatus, or global warming pause, which has been debated in detail by scientists for more than six years, especially since scientific frustration at the pace of warming was revealed through the infamous "Climategate" emails. Renowned climate scientist -Judith Curry blogged about the latest research this month saying the "hiatus clearly lives, both in upper ocean heat content and surface temperatures" and added it would be interesting to see how the media reacted to this news given they had declared it an "artefact" only weeks earlier.
This debate has been largely absent from the ABC except for belated attempts to debunk the pause claims.
The science program Catalyst tackled the issue last October in a story that included Professor Curry explaining that "globally -average surface temperatures haven't increased in any significant way since 1998." While Curry was identified as belonging to a "small minority" of scientists she was allowed to make the central points about a "growing divergence between the observations and climate model simulations." Yet the story's clear aim was to relay that "all things considered, there's been no global warming pause." It gave most prominence to that argument and scientists promoting it.
"The whole of the climate system is really warming," said Kevin Trenberth, "it's just that the warming can be manifested in different ways." What we're seeing in the models," said Matthew England, "is that the warming out of the hiatus is gonna be rapid, regardless of when that hiatus ends." In other words the models that did not predict the hiatus are now predicting that when the hiatus ends warming will be even more rapid.
Does this mean they are really saying forget the observations, believe the modelling?
The ABC refuses to ask such obvious and sceptical questions. The national broadcaster prefers to turn its sights on any media raising an eyebrow, testing an assertion or allowing experts to do the same.
Tellingly, the ABC never reported the significant revisions to global climate predictions that were snuck onto the UK Met Office website on Christmas Eve 2012.
Given the Met's standing as a leading international climate centre, this was big news.
"If the forecast is accurate, the result would be that the global average temperature would have remained relatively static for about two decades," reported the BBC.
"An apparent standstill in global temperatures is used by critics of efforts to tackle climate change as evidence that the threat has been exaggerated. Climate scientists at the Met Office and other centres are involved in intense research to try to understand what is happening over the most recent period." It appears the ABC never reported this issue and, all-in-all, -ignored the pause until it was ready to run reports debunking it, or at the end of last year, saying it was over.
ABC radio breathlessly reported in December that 2014 was on track to be the warmest year ever and that "contrary to the position argued by climate change sceptics" global warming had neither paused nor slowed down. Rather than "contrary to the position argued" by sceptics it would have been more accurate to say "contrary to the recorded -observations." The ABC gives us alarmist claims from those demanding urgent action and denies us information about observed evidence or dissent against the alarmist claims. Yet we are given rebuttals of the dissent.
It is Orwellian.
Media Watch took a keen interest in this newspaper's coverage from 2012 of beach erosion issues at Lake Cathie, on the NSW -Central Coast, where residents faced the threat of planning changes based on IPCC sea level projections.
"We don't want to shift, no way," said Russell Secombe who, along with his wife, Anne, and the owners of 16 other houses on the Illaroo Road beachfront, was -concerned about a report before council recommending a "planned retreat" in the face of coastal -erosion.
Media Watch forensically analysed these reports, demonstrating poor headline choice and contesting some interpretations.
But reporter Ean Higgins -pursued this story over subsequent years, taking up the cause of -people who had invested their life savings in their homes and seen their values fall because of the looming restrictions.
Eventually, thanks in no small part to Higgins's reporting, the planning minister stepped in.
"The problem that property owners face is that some councils have been casting potential longer-term issues as a clear-and-present danger," said the minister.
"We just needed to get councils to jump away from that doomsday scenario." This is the core work of journalists - identifying issues where citizens are being adversely affected by authorities, shedding light on their fears and concerns, seeking responses and sometimes, just sometimes, helping to build -momentum for resolutions.
Ideally such reportage would never suffer from an error or inappropriate headline but the world is not perfect.
In a range of other areas - perhaps workers concerned about asbestos, or farmers concerned about climate change reducing their crops - we know the ABC would champion such journalism.
Perhaps for Media Watch the problem with Higgins and the homeowners at Lake Cathie was not so much that they stood between the council and the sea but that they stood between climate alarmism and a sensible, more cautious approach.
Another Media Watch attack centred on Lloyd's January report about a groundbreaking study into the possibility of adverse health effects from wind turbines.
His story contained all the relevant details about the scope, funding and limitations of the study.
And it overtly referred to the need for more research into an open question: "It opens the way for a full-scale medical trial that may resolve the contentious -debate about the health impact of wind farms." Yet Media Watch insisted that Lloyd's report had "got it so wrong" and it lined up a series of so-called experts to condemn the coverage.
Barry selectively quoted the study's author to suggest he disagreed with Lloyd's reporting when he did not (Barry had him rebutting a claim that was not made) and he quoted damning comments about the "atrocious" study and its coverage from an academic without disclosing the professor's qualifications were not in science but sociology.
Media Watch was slapping down Lloyd for daring to air a study that merely raises the possibility of adverse health consequences from wind turbines.
Barry and his sizeable team used precisely the toolkit of selective reporting, omission and emotive posturing that they seek to expose in their targets.
They mock the suggestion of health concerns with jokes about "yolkless eggs" and snide -comments about stories being "excitedly" relayed.
To put the program's journalism and objectivity into perspective we need only pose this question; do we think they would be this dismissive of early reports about possible health risks with asbestos, coal dust or yellowcake?
We don't need to believe wind turbines are harmful to make the point that if the industry were not renewable energy, the ABC might be all over the potential workplace health and safety implications of new technologies.
Good journalism is obliged to investigate and debate such -matters. For regular viewers there is a clear sense that Media Watch is campaigning on climate. Inquirer spoke to prominent advocates in the climate change debate and none seemed surprised to be asked about their engagement with the program.
Australian National University professor and former climate commissioner Will Steffen says he "interacts a lot" with the ABC but "not a whole lot" with Media Watch.
"I think I have been in contact with them once or twice to comment on issues but that has come at their instigation," he said.
At the Clean Energy Council, spokesman Mark Bretherton also talked down their contact. "It is not that often that we talk to Media Watch," he said, "the last time would have been a year or two ago and generally when we talk to them they contact us rather than the other way around." But the Climate Institute's John Connor admits to being more proactive. "They come to us for fact-checking," he said, "we're happy to help and perhaps the same amount of times I have raised issues with them, perhaps once or twice." Mr Connor said when he made his suggestions they had been followed up with broadcasts but he can't remember what the issues were. "I certainly wouldn't characterise it as an ongoing relationship." Back in 2012 Media Watch was again defending the renewable energy sector and admonishing The Australian for daring to report that despite the addition of wind turbines, Victoria's dirty brown coal generators were still running at full capacity.
"It was one of those stories that make The Australian's readers wonder why we bother with all this renewable energy nonsense," sneered Holmes, preferring not to review it as an important story explaining how the addition of wind farms tended not to diminish the need for baseload power.
Media Watch based their entire criticism on the reality of the National Electricity Market, suggesting that with wind energy inputs Victoria could export more coal power and reduce emissions in NSW and South Australia.
It was a heroic argument, ignoring the coal burned, not for export, but just to keep the baseload generators running.
The facts were disputed by experts including Hamish Cumming, the source of Lloyd's story, who complained that Media Watch refused to consider his research.
Few issues could be more pertinent to the national policy debate than whether the additional costs to consumers of mandated renewables was actually reducing emissions. But Media Watch, it seems, would rather we didn't inquire.
This month Media Watch again singled out a Lloyd report as it -attacked many media organisations for the way they reported new research about the prospects of a "mini-ice age" or, more correctly, the onset of a Maunder Minimum because of reduced solar activity.
Barry admonished Lloyd, even though his report was detailed, -accurate and played down the overall impact of this phenomenon.
"The dominant view among -climate scientists is that it is too small to have a major impact," -reported Lloyd.
Tellingly, Barry was dismissive about the possibility of regionalised cooling of up to 0.8 degrees when warming projections generate great excitement.
Laughably, he criticised Lloyd's report because the qualifying information was deeper in the story than the newsworthy claims in the first two paragraphs "which is what everyone reads".
We can only imagine how busy Barry would be if he troubled himself with such journalistic parsing-in-full of stories predicting increased global warming or exacerbated environmental damage.
We see a familiar pattern here.
The Australian puts studies, concerns and information into the public arena to contribute to serious policy debates and Media Watch hits back, condemning those reports, suggesting information that questions the economics, environmental benefits or health effects of renewable energy should not be reported or that reports focusing on climate observations that are less than alarmist should be ignored.
This is jaundice, pure and -simple.
And it raises the question of whether the personal prejudices of Holmes and Barry (and possibly others) have had a strong influence on the editorial direction of Media Watch over the past decade, helping to buttress a widespread lack of journalistic curiosity on -climate change issues.Media Watch could be the choirmaster of the ABC's climate change groupthink and a broader journalistic chorus.

Media Watch forensically analysed these reports, demonstrating poor headline choice and contesting some interpretations.
But reporter Ean Higgins -pursued this story over subsequent years, taking up the cause of -people who had invested their life savings in their homes and seen their values fall because of the looming restrictions.
Eventually, thanks in no small part to Higgins's reporting, the planning minister stepped in.
"The problem that property owners face is that some councils have been casting potential longer-term issues as a clear-and-present danger," said the minister.
"We just needed to get councils to jump away from that doomsday scenario." This is the core work of journalists - identifying issues where citizens are being adversely affected by authorities, shedding light on their fears and concerns, seeking responses and sometimes, just sometimes, helping to build -momentum for resolutions.
Ideally such reportage would never suffer from an error or inappropriate headline but the world is not perfect.
In a range of other areas - perhaps workers concerned about asbestos, or farmers concerned about climate change reducing their crops - we know the ABC would champion such journalism.
Perhaps for Media Watch the problem with Higgins and the homeowners at Lake Cathie was not so much that they stood between the council and the sea but that they stood between climate alarmism and a sensible, more cautious approach.
Another Media Watch attack centred on Lloyd's January report about a groundbreaking study into the possibility of adverse health effects from wind turbines.
His story contained all the relevant details about the scope, funding and limitations of the study.
And it overtly referred to the need for more research into an open question: "It opens the way for a full-scale medical trial that may resolve the contentious -debate about the health impact of wind farms." Yet Media Watch insisted that Lloyd's report had "got it so wrong" and it lined up a series of so-called experts to condemn the coverage.
Barry selectively quoted the study's author to suggest he disagreed with Lloyd's reporting when he did not (Barry had him rebutting a claim that was not made) and he quoted damning comments about the "atrocious" study and its coverage from an academic without disclosing the professor's qualifications were not in science but sociology.
Media Watch was slapping down Lloyd for daring to air a study that merely raises the possibility of adverse health consequences from wind turbines.
Barry and his sizeable team used precisely the toolkit of selective reporting, omission and emotive posturing that they seek to expose in their targets.
They mock the suggestion of health concerns with jokes about "yolkless eggs" and snide -comments about stories being "excitedly" relayed.
To put the program's journalism and objectivity into perspective we need only pose this question; do we think they would be this dismissive of early reports about possible health risks with asbestos, coal dust or yellowcake?
We don't need to believe wind turbines are harmful to make the point that if the industry were not renewable energy, the ABC might be all over the potential workplace health and safety implications of new technologies.
Good journalism is obliged to investigate and debate such -matters. For regular viewers there is a clear sense that Media Watch is campaigning on climate. Inquirer spoke to prominent advocates in the climate change debate and none seemed surprised to be asked about their engagement with the program.
Australian National University professor and former climate commissioner Will Steffen says he "interacts a lot" with the ABC but "not a whole lot" with Media Watch.
"I think I have been in contact with them once or twice to comment on issues but that has come at their instigation," he said.
At the Clean Energy Council, spokesman Mark Bretherton also talked down their contact. "It is not that often that we talk to Media Watch," he said, "the last time would have been a year or two ago and generally when we talk to them they contact us rather than the other way around." But the Climate Institute's John Connor admits to being more proactive. "They come to us for fact-checking," he said, "we're happy to help and perhaps the same amount of times I have raised issues with them, perhaps once or twice." Mr Connor said when he made his suggestions they had been followed up with broadcasts but he can't remember what the issues were. "I certainly wouldn't characterise it as an ongoing relationship." Back in 2012 Media Watch was again defending the renewable energy sector and admonishing The Australian for daring to report that despite the addition of wind turbines, Victoria's dirty brown coal generators were still running at full capacity.
"It was one of those stories that make The Australian's readers wonder why we bother with all this renewable energy nonsense," sneered Holmes, preferring not to review it as an important story explaining how the addition of wind farms tended not to diminish the need for baseload power.
Media Watch based their entire criticism on the reality of the National Electricity Market, suggesting that with wind energy inputs Victoria could export more coal power and reduce emissions in NSW and South Australia.
It was a heroic argument, ignoring the coal burned, not for export, but just to keep the baseload generators running.
The facts were disputed by experts including Hamish Cumming, the source of Lloyd's story, who complained that Media Watch refused to consider his research.
Few issues could be more pertinent to the national policy debate than whether the additional costs to consumers of mandated renewables was actually reducing emissions. But Media Watch, it seems, would rather we didn't inquire.
This month Media Watch again singled out a Lloyd report as it -attacked many media organisations for the way they reported new research about the prospects of a "mini-ice age" or, more correctly, the onset of a Maunder Minimum because of reduced solar activity.
Barry admonished Lloyd, even though his report was detailed, -accurate and played down the overall impact of this phenomenon.
"The dominant view among -climate scientists is that it is too small to have a major impact," -reported Lloyd.
Tellingly, Barry was dismissive about the possibility of regionalised cooling of up to 0.8 degrees when warming projections generate great excitement.
Laughably, he criticised Lloyd's report because the qualifying information was deeper in the story than the newsworthy claims in the first two paragraphs "which is what everyone reads".
We can only imagine how busy Barry would be if he troubled himself with such journalistic parsing-in-full of stories predicting increased global warming or exacerbated environmental damage.
We see a familiar pattern here.
The Australian puts studies, concerns and information into the public arena to contribute to serious policy debates and Media Watch hits back, condemning those reports, suggesting information that questions the economics, environmental benefits or health effects of renewable energy should not be reported or that reports focusing on climate observations that are less than alarmist should be ignored.
This is jaundice, pure and -simple.
And it raises the question of whether the personal prejudices of Holmes and Barry (and possibly others) have had a strong influence on the editorial direction of Media Watch over the past decade, helping to buttress a widespread lack of journalistic curiosity on -climate change issues.Media Watch could be the choirmaster of the ABC's climate change groupthink and a broader journalistic chorus.

Eco-realists challenge the panicked push for climate change action in Paris

Evidence cited by Judith Curry and others questions the need for urgency
Against the backdrop of seasonal wild weather that cost lives, flooded towns and eroded coastlines this week, there was a storm surge of pressure for the federal government to lift its ambition to tackle climate change.
World leaders, notably China and the US, were asking tough questions about the Abbott government's intent, the public was told. A successful auction that secured a higher-than-expected 50 million tonnes of carbon abatement under Direct Action was widely rejected as not enough.
The Climate Change Authority said greenhouse gas emission cuts of 30 per cent by 2025 were needed to restore Australia's standing in the eyes of the world.
Research published in Nature Climate Change said the long--denied "pause" in global average surface temperature rises was a passing phenomenon in a long-term upward trend.
And fringe climate groups couldn't help linking the "super-storm" to man-made climate even though it was considered to be a once-in-a-decade occurrence.
Veteran US climate scientist Judith Curry has a phrase to describe what politicians, activists and journalists are doing to stimulate the sense of urgency required to boost their agenda for a compact in Paris at the end of the year to limit global carbon dioxide emissions with the aim of keeping the temperature rise to 2C.
Curry's "biased information cascade of alarm" describes how the more attention a danger gets, the more worried people become, leading to more news coverage and greater alarm.
Because slowly increasing temperatures don't seem alarming, Curry reasons, the focus has been switched to extreme weather events and public health impacts as being caused by human-caused climate change, more of which is in store if we don't quickly act to cool the planet by reducing fossil fuel emissions. But the cascade described by Curry sidesteps a growing discussion about how urgent is the need to act. By its nature the cascade does not present a full account of the issues being discussed in the scientific community, or what is happening in global energy markets where China is becoming banker to the developing world for an avalanche of proposed coal-fired power stations.
The lobbying also ignores an unfolding global discussion about the changing nature of environmentalism. Many of the sentiments are outlined in An Ecomodernist Manifesto, a provocative tract signed by respected scientists and environmentalists from the US, Britain, India and Australia. The declaration of so-called eco-rationalists from Harvard, Columbia University and the Breakthrough Institute argues technology is the pathway to decoupling human advancement from the consumption of nature.
In an area fraught with moral challenge, the group says the ethical and pragmatic path towards a just and sustainable global energy economy requires that human beings move as rapidly as possible to energy sources that are cheap, clean, dense and abundant.
But it says most forms of renewable energy are, unfortunately, incapable of meeting the challenge. Rather, the manifesto says, "next-generation solar, advanced nuclear fission and nuclear fusion represent the most plausible pathways toward the joint goals of climate stabilisation and radical decoupling of humans from nature".
The manifesto is not an argument for inaction, as detractors claim. But it provides a framework that integrates climate change action into a broader narrative.
A key question is whether the latest evidence on climate change gives the world more time to act. With the Paris deadline looming, urgency is very much at the core of the Climate Change Authority's call for Australia to go beyond the minimum 2020 target of a 5 per cent reduction in emissions compared with 2000 levels. The authority says its recommended target for Australia of a 30 per cent reduction in emissions by 2025 will be broadly comparable with the targets other wealthy developed countries will bring to the table in Paris.
But the federal government says the recommendation is too harsh. It will take comfort from the view of some scientists that the need for action may not be as pressing as the public is being told.
In testimony to the US House of Representatives' Committee on Science, Space and Technology this month, Curry said she was increasingly concerned that the climate change problem and its solution had been vastly oversimplified.
Curry is a controversial figure, but she told the hearing that she had devoted 30 years to research topics including climate feedback processes in the Arctic, the role of clouds and aerosols in the climate system, and the impact of climate change on tropical cyclones.
She says scientists agree that surface temperatures have increased since 1880, humans are adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere and carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have a warming effect on the planet. However, she says there is considerable disagreement about the most consequential issues. These include whether the warming since 1950 has been dominated by human causes, how much the planet will warm in the 21st century and whether warming is dangerous.
Curry says recent data and research support the importance of natural climate variability and call into question the conclusion that humans are the dominant cause of recent climate change.
The evidence she cites includes the slowdown in global warming since 1998, reduced estimates of the sensitivity of climate to carbon dioxide, and climate models that predict much more warming than has been observed so far in the 21st century. If the climate is less sensitive to carbon dioxide than previously thought, there is more time to act. But research published in Nature Climate Change says climate models show the two-decade pause in surface warming is due to natural cycles and will soon be overwhelmed. The research relies on climate models that so far have over-estimated the amount of warming..
Curry believes the arbitrary target of 2C warming to avoid the most serious effects of climate change may take much longer to arrive than models are suggesting. This will allow more time to manage a transition to a lower carbon global economy. But it also will dampen the urgency driving the Paris declaration process.
Ultimately, Curry believes climate change has become a grand narrative in which human-caused global warming has become a dominant cause of societal problems. Everything that goes wrong, and even pre-existing concerns, reinforces the conviction that there is only one thing we can do to prevent societal problems - stop burning fossil fuels.
"This grand narrative misleads us to think that if we solve the problem of climate change, then these other problems would be ameliorated." she says.
Eco-realists contend that for the bulk of the world's population, energy poverty is the immediate concern that must be resolved before climate change action can hope to deliver the desired results.The question remains whether ambitious early action will foster long-term change or squander the opportunity for a more considered solution.

THE GREAT CLIMATE CHANGE JUGGLING ACT
The Australian

Politicians must judge how much voters will sacrifice to achieve lower emissions In recent days, climate change policy has divided the Nationals as much as it divides the Liberals.
But the question "Do you believe in climate change?" is a curious one because it suggests that change in climate is not a matter of fact but a matter of faith.
The recent bushfire disasters in Australia have been taken by many to confirm that the climate is indeed changing and have prompted more urgent demands that the government do much more to reduce emissions.
Yet the 1974-75 fire season burnt almost 10 times the area so far destroyed this season and the 2009 Black Saturday fires killed in a single day five times as many people - 173 people died on Black Saturday and more than 100 million hectares burnt in 1974-75.
As a moment's thought would confirm, of course climate changes. The ice ages are an obvious example of it doing so. There was the Roman warm period when grapes grew against Hadrian's Wall; the medieval warm period when crops flourished on Greenland; and the mini-ice age of the 1600s when the Thames routinely froze. And the story of the Flood would seem to suggest that, in pre-biblical times, the world experienced a cataclysmic climate event.
So the relevant question is not whether climate changes but the significance of carbon dioxide emissions in climate change, and the correct policy response to the changes that human emissions seem to be driving.
We're often told that 97 per cent of scientists believe in anthropogenic global warming and the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change regularly publishes reports modelling a range of different climate scenarios based on assumptions about the impact of different levels of CO2. In some of these scenarios, global temperatures could be several degrees higher and sea levels could rise by 2m within a century. Predictably, it's the worst-case scenario that attracts the headlines, and if this happened overnight it would certainly be a disaster. Hence governments around the world are urged to take strong action to try to limit emissions.
But other distinguished climate scientists are not so sure. Professors Richard Lindzen and Judith Curry, for instance, question whether carbon dioxide is the real climate villain.
In any event, while politics is often a matter of the "numbers", science never should be.
As I understand the facts, during the past century atmospheric carbon dioxide has risen from about 300 parts per million to 414 parts per million in 2020. This is chiefly due to human activity such as power generation, transport and agriculture, and, over the same time, global temperatures have risen by about 1C. All other things being equal, so the physics tells us, higher carbon dioxide concentrations should warm the planet by absorbing and retaining more of the sun's heat.
But as we know, all things aren't equal. Sunspot activity and slight oscillations in the Earth's orbit also affect climate. Moreover, the geological record suggests that, at different times in the distant past, the Earth has been both hotter and colder with higher and lower concentrations of atmospheric CO2.
Nevertheless, it seems highly likely that, due to human activity, the rate of increase in CO2 emissions is unprecedented and it's quite possible that even small-but-very-fast increases in CO2 could make climate change worse.
That's why it makes sense to limit emissions and to reduce them wherever possible. But, in this regard, a key question is how much disruption and cost are we prepared to bear? And this is where it clearly becomes a question of preferences or value judgments rather than pure science.
If we could all but eliminate human emissions by changing to renewable energy without jeopardising the affordability and reliability of our power supply; if we could eliminate agricultural emissions without giving up meat; and if there were a costless way to shift to electric cars, we would readily change.
But there is not, and the claim that technology will soon solve all these issues is questionable.
Then there's the issue of whether anything Australia does will make any difference. We account for 1.3 per cent of human emissions and any reduction here will be swamped by increases from China and India - which are unapologetically upfront that the dangers of climate change are not as serious as the need to increase their people's standard of living via higher electricity use, better diet and better transportation.
The "do much more" advocates say that we wouldn't use others' inaction to justify not saving a drowning man or extinguishing a burning building. Fair enough, but only if what we do will actually make a discernible difference, and unfortunately it won't if global emissions continue to increase.
When Tony Abbott was prime minister, he had a formula that went something like this: climate does change, humans do make a difference and we should take reasonable steps to reduce emissions; but in doing so we shouldn't put jobs and our prosperity at peril.
Abbott eventually decided that a reduction of 26 per cent in Australia's emissions by 2030 was a sensible balance between climate risk and economic cost.
And until our recent bushfires produced a moral panic, that was always Scott Morrison's position too. For Morrison, the problem is that his time in office may well coincide with Australia experiencing an increase in extreme weather events. Thirty years ago such events could have been written off as acts of God. But in 2020 many voters are highly likely to blame lack of government response to human-induced climate change. And there's the rub for the Prime Minister and his government.
Climate change is a matter of fact, and the Coalition must deal with its complex implications to juggle an economically, environmentally and politically palatable mix of policies in the hope of dealing effectively with this crucial issue, while remaining electable.Ross Fitzgerald is emeritus professor of history and politics at Griffith University and the author of 41 books, most recently political-sexual satire The Dizzying Heights (Hybrid).

Climate change a key security issue
The Australian
December 2, 2016 Friday, Australian Edition

In September, US President Barack Obama signed a presidential memorandum on climate change and national security.
It establishes a policy that the impacts of climate change must be considered in the development of national security doctrine, policies and plans.
To achieve this, 20 US agencies and offices with climate science, intelligence analysis and national security policy development missions and responsibilities will collaborate to ensure the best information on climate impacts is available to prepare for unavoidable impacts.
The day the memorandum was issued, the US -National Intelligence Council released its own report identifying how climate change could pose significant security challenges for the US over the next two decades, including stressing US military operations and bases and straining the capacity of US and allied armed forces to deliver humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.
There's now evidence that the tide's also turning here: Defence is recognising the challenges posed by a changing climate and the closely related subject of energy sustainability.
Last year's Defence white paper referred to climate change and its deleterious effect on both the strategic environment and on defence infrastructure.
Since Australia signed a statement of co-operation agreement with the US Navy in 2012 to share information on alternative fuels, the RAN has progressed from testing one Seahawk helicopter during RIMPAC four years ago, to three warships that took more than 4.5 megalitres of blended -alternative fuel from US oilers during RIMPAC in August.
In May, Chief of Navy Tim Barrett approved the use of US Navy-sourced alternative fuel blends for RAN ships' diesel as a replacement fuel for RAN ships manufactured via the US Navy-approved pathways.
Technical constraints for the two current pathways for producing RAN diesel from synthetic crude require that it must be blended with at least 50 per cent of diesel produced from fossil crude to meet Navy standards.
Defence on its own won't shape the energy market, even though it spent $524 million on fuel in 2014/15 (just under 60 per cent air force, 33 per cent navy and the residual to army).
Defence use of liquid fuels is a drop in the ocean of the nation's fuels consumption (industry and mining are much bigger users). But there's no reason why Defence shouldn't set an ambitious target in terms of moving towards alternative fuels by announcing it's ready to receive cost-competitive blended products.
Perhaps the clearest statement on the way Defence is starting to think harder about climate change came in September from Lieutenant General Angus Campbell in his opening address to the Chief of Army's exercise.
His speech had a focus on climate change. He said the top 10 most at risk countries with exposure to sea level rise by 2100 were all in the Indo-Pacific. More than 138 million people are at risk. More than 500,000 people live in the small Pacific and Indian Ocean island states that may become uninhabitable between 2050 and 2100.
An unstable planet, he said, was one of the three issues he believed central to the security challenges we'll encounter in redefining boundaries for the 21st century land force. (The other two were what he called empowered individuals and assertive states, although he said there was some degree of interplay between the three drivers.) The general said that while we didn't know where the problem of climate change would take us, he said climate change was the "ultimate threat multiplier".
Campbell said armed forces had their role to play in response to climate change, not just in adopting best practice on environmental management and energy needs, but in increasing the use of Defence assets in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. He said the scale of climate change problems, their unpredictability and the level of support required from land forces were key issues for Defence.
He should be commended for delivering this message: there's no doubt some of our new capabilities such as the Canberra-class LHDs, future frigates, offshore patrol vessels and our air transport fleet will find climate change and its effects a key driver of activity over the coming decades. Within regions where resources come under strain, nationalism will surge and conflict can erupt.
But we've fair way to go when compared to our major ally. Last year the US Defence department issued a directive that dictates that climate change be incorporated into every aspect of US military training and preparedness.
The directive says Defence must be able identify and assess the effects of climate change and take those effects into consideration when planning. It must anticipate and manage risks that develop as a result of climate change to build resilience.
A point of interest for Australia is that the directive says the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will work with US allies and partners to optimise joint exercises and war games incorporating climate change considerations.
Defence should now appoint a senior military leader to act as a strategic voice for climate change national security issues, including preparedness and capability. The first step would be a review of climate change impacts on -Defence.
One area for -Defence to examine would be -alternative jet fuels. Scientists are close to using eucalyptus trees to develop renewable jet fuel.
Eucalyptus oil contains compounds that can be refined through a catalytic process and converted into a high-energy fuel.
Defence could initiate a pilot program and team with researchers to grow its own jet fuel and revegetate arid and semi-arid bases and training ranges with suitable trees. It might partner with indigenous communities and provide jobs and iron out the ups and downs of commercial fuel prices.Anthony Bergin is senior research fellow at the ANU National Security College and senior analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.

Climate change 'an issue for defence'

Not enough is being done to prepare the Australian Defence Force to deal with the security threats and other consequences of climate change, warns a new report by former ADF chief Chris Barrie.
Admiral Barrie says the Asia-Pacific is the most disaster-prone region in the world and the ADF is under escalating pressure to help with climate-induced natural disasters.
"Climate change is driving more frequent and intense natural disasters, driving up food -prices and displacing people, all of which can lead to conflict," he writes in "Be Prepared: Climate Change, Security and Australia's Defence Force", which is published today by the Climate Council.
Admiral Barrie says it is impossible to prioritise national security without prioritising climate change. Climate change will significantly affect accessibility and availability of freshwater resources and was a key factor in the 2008 food crisis, that increased the number of undernourished people worldwide by 75 million, he says.
"Climate change is a threat multiplier that exacerbates other stressors, such as poverty and economic shocks, worsening tensions and increasing the risk of conflict. Climate change will increase sea level rise, drive up global temperatures and increase the frequency and intensity of -extreme weather events." Admiral Barrie says Australia is lagging behind its allies, Britain and the US, in preparing its military for climate change. "Governments in the UK and US have taken significant legislative and strategic steps to ensure that climate change is integrated into defence planning," he says.
The report also says strong -action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is critical to limiting the security implications of a changing climate.
Military forces around the world have identified climate change as a high-risk phenomenon, Admiral Barrie says.
"When conservative institutions, run by people with some of the most strategic brains on the planet, determine something to be high risk, you want to make sure you're prepared."Admiral Barrie says the ADF has done serious planning for scenarios much less likely than climate change.

WE'RE DOING WELL ON CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT LET'S START ACTING AS A TEAM

Not many Australians understand the vast commitments made to secure a safe future It's not surprising that the continuing drought, the driest ever for many parts of the country, record temperatures and the early and explosive start of the bushfire season have increased public concern about climate change and triggered accusations the government is failing to prepare communities for these growing hazards.
While it is true that government responses are lagging in Australia, as they are in most other countries, the Morrison government is doing more to build Australia's climate resilience than its critics (or even the government itself) may realise. That's because many of its initiatives are not branded as "climate change" and are embedded in the bureaucratic silos of government departments that have other mandates.
Some examples of this include the $5bn Future Drought Fund, the $4.5bn Roads of Strategic Importance Initiative, the $3.9bn Emergency Response Fund, the $1.5bn National Water Infrastructure Development Fund, the $130m National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework, and the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrange-ments, each of which provides very significant funding for activities to strengthen resilience to floods, droughts and other climate-related hazards that climate change is amplifying.
The problem is that this lack of integration at whole-of-government level is creating inefficiencies that we can ill-afford in a rapidly changing climate.
The Department of Environment and Energy co-ordinates the National Climate Resilience and Adaptation Strategy, but the strategy is not integrated with the Department of Home Affairs' National Disaster Risk Reduction Framework, even though more than 90 per cent of all disasters are from hazards, such as floods and droughts, that climate change is worsening.
Similarly, the $100bn National Infrastructure Investment Program in the Department of Transportation, Cities and Regional Development, could be better leveraged to build regional and local resilience to climate hazards.
The ADF and the Australian aid program should also be key elements of a coherent national approach.
As we are already seeing, our military will increasingly need to be called upon to support disaster response within Australia and to respond to regional disasters, territorial disputes, and people movements driven by food instability and other climate-related disruptions. Careful targeting of the aid program's $665m of development assistance for resilience-building can support both our humanitarian and national security objectives, decreasing the need for ADF responses to some of these emerging challenges.
We must bring together this significant ongoing work more coherently. The recent Independent Review of the Australian Public Service, submitted to the Prime Minister last September, suggests a useful way forward. The review highlighted the key role of the APS Secretaries Board in driving policy across portfolios and explored options to strengthen the governance and resourcing of the board to drive delivery of whole-of-government outcomes. Building Australia's resilience in the face of our changing climate is exactly the sort of cross-departmental challenge that would benefit from the board's leadership.
Preparing a more coherent national approach would also make it easier to identify gaps that need to be addressed. A few already stand out. The federal government has no legislated authority -defining its role, powers and responsibilities in responding to catastrophic natural disasters. This will become increasingly problematic in a rapidly warming climate. Governments in Canada and the US have this authority, even though they too have federal systems that vest the primary responsibility for responding to natural disasters at a state level.
Greater attention should also be devoted to mainstreaming disaster risk reduction across all of the commonwealth's investments and we need to begin thinking more deeply about the implications for communities that are, or will soon be, in chronic crisis, including options such as managed retreats, land swaps and financial incentives for farmers to transition to other livelihoods.
Notwithstanding the polarising political rhetoric, there is strong bipartisan support for initiatives to build Australia's resilience to climate hazards. Both major parties, for example, supported passage of the Future Drought and Emergency Response funds.
Given the increasing impact disasters are having on Australian communities, it is in our national interest for this bipartisan approach to become stronger, more visible and explicit. As this happens, it may also help to unlock opportunities for bipartisan efforts in other, more politically challenging, but fundamentally important areas, such as climate change mitigation.Dr Robert Glasser is a visiting fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute and is a former United Nations secretary-general's special representative for disaster risk reduction.

Remedying the technology deficit needs to take precedence over efforts to cut carbon
Politicians are gathering in Poland for a climate summit being billed as the most important conference since the Paris treaty was signed in 2015. Around the world the chattering classes have declared that more political willpower is needed to solve global warming. This is deluded: it ignores the privileged place climate change has among all of humanity's challenges and misses the real reasons for our failure.
Across the past quarter-century climate change has received more attention - and generated more prophesies of doom - from political and religious leaders, celebrities and royalty than any other issue.
It is given so much attention that it is sacrilegious to even point out that we face other vast, complex, expensive challenges including war and domestic violence, super-killers such as tuberculosis and HIV, hunger and a lack of clean drinking water, gender inequality - and the list goes on. Many of these global challenges have a greater cost and have policy responses that are better understood, more easily implemented and will help humanity much more than our current response to climate change.
Climate change is real but it's not our only problem - and it's not the apocalypse painted in the media. The IPCC's last major planetary survey calculated the global effects of unstopped climate change. The scientists established that globally the effect of climate change will be similar to a single recession. It will mean the average person forgoes benefits equivalent to between 0.2 per cent and 2 per cent of income in the 2070s.
Bear in mind that by then incomes will have increased by at least 300 per cent to 400 per cent.
But what about the natural disasters that the media constantly equates with global warming? A little-reported finding in the recently published IPCC report is that there is little basis for claiming that droughts, floods and hurricanes have increased, much less that they have increased because of carbon emissions.
Yet we are being told once again that we have one slim last opportunity to save the planet. How familiar. Nearly 40 years ago the UN environment chief warned we faced environmental disaster "as final as nuclear war" by 2000.
In 2009 British prime minister Gordon Brown was among those claiming we were at doom's door: if no climate deal was struck that year, it would be "irretrievably too late". (No climate deal was struck that year.) There have been 23 annual UN-convened summits attracting the great and the good. In Paris in 2015, world leaders signed a treaty to cut carbon emissions. This loose collection of national carbon-cutting promises until 2030 (with vague promises after that) is not backed by any repercussions for failing or quitting. Despite the clear likelihood that nothing would change once everyone got home, the leaders heartily slapped each other on the back and environmentalists cheered.
Even at the time, the wishful thinking seemed bizarre. One climate analysis group gained attention for finding that the Paris Agreement could result in a significant temperature reduction of 0.9C. This came not from analysis of the promises up until 2030 but from assuming there would be much stronger climate policies after the Paris agreement: 98 per cent of the expected reductions came from actions after 2030.
Activist group 350.org was even giddier, declaring the date of the treaty's signature marked "the end of the era of fossil fuels". That same group today says: "Staying under 1.5C is now only a matter of political will." It was utterly wrong in 2015 and it is still wrong today.
The IPCC itself sets out a string of highly implausible, incredibly expensive, technologically complex actions that are all required together to have any hope of cutting carbon enough to keep temperature rises under 1.5C. We need to hit peak carbon dioxide emissions within just a few years, stop using coal entirely, shut a string of natural gas-fired power plants, massively expand carbon capture technology and increase our reliance on nuclear energy. An area between one million square kilometres (all of France plus all of Germany) and seven million square kilometres (three-quarters the size of the US or all of Australia) needs to be dedicated to growing crops for energy, in a way that doesn't displace food crops, otherwise more people will go hungry.
The truth is that keeping rises under 1.5C in any realistic sense is impossible. The newest Nobel laureate in climate economics points out that even 2C is unrealistic: "2C appears to be infeasible with reasonably accessible technologies even with very ambitious abatement strategies." In 2013 the IPCC estimated that the world could make only 400 gigatonnes of emissions before the world would go over 1.5C. Conveniently, it is now rather magically more than doubling this figure. Key IPCC author Jim Skea came close to admitting that all this is completely far-fetched, saying: "Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics but doing so would require unprecedented changes." To achieve what the IPCC sets out, what is needed is not political willpower, it's a string of miracles. Wilful wishful thinking may make us feel warm and fuzzy but it is extremely dangerous to use as a policy guide when spending trillions of dollars.
As a reality check, this is where we are today: the International Energy Agency estimates that globally we get less than 1 per cent of our energy needs from solar and wind, and even in 2040, doing everything promised in the Paris Agreement, we'll get 3.6 per cent. The IEA estimates that optimistically we'll go from about two million electric cars today to 300 million in 2040. This will reduce global emissions by less than 1 per cent as these cars still will get half their electricity from fossil fuels and as oil will become cheaper and used more elsewhere as demand from cars reduces.
The reason we are failing isn't because people aren't willing to take action. It's because green energy sources are not yet competitive enough to take over from fossil fuels for all of our energy needs. Our policy approach puts the cart before the horse by trying to force or entice people to make the switch to less efficient, more expensive technology.
This has a huge societal cost because less efficient, more expensive energy means less growth, especially for the world's poor. This, of course, also could help the many other challenges still facing the world. The meagre Paris Agreement alone will cost us all more than $1 trillion a year.
We need to ensure green energy is the smart, cost-effective choice. We should abandon the failed promise-to-cut-carbon experiment and focus on the technology deficit.
Copenhagen Consensus analysis shows a green energy research and development budget worth about $100 billion a year would be the most effective climate policy.
We should abandon wishful thinking and over-the-top rhetoric, and focus on tackling all of humanity's challenges, including with smart, effective and workable solutions to climate change.Bjorn Lomborg is president of the Copenhagen Consensus Centre and visiting professor at Copenhagen Business School.

The ABC of misinformation: how our national broadcaster gets it so wrong on climate change
The Australian
May 25, 2020 Monday, Australian2 Edition

Section: MEDIA; Pg. 19

The internal ABC emails detailed in this column last Monday demonstrated the organisation's obsession with climate change, as well as some of the ignorance around the topic. That night, the national broadcaster's premier current affairs program, Four Corners, amplified these faults.
The program showcased the simplistic, incurious and deceptive way the ABC covers climate change. It opened with horrific bushfire vision accompanied by dramatic -music to exploit our Black Summer's tenuous link to global warming.
Reporter Michael Brissenden noted it was "one of the longest and most widespread fire seasons in our history" without, apparently, pondering the significance of the words "one of", before then adding it was "fuelled by a changing climate".
Still, the program made no -attempt to interrogate scientific -issues beyond Brissenden's laughable insistence that this year will be a climate "tipping point".
How many of them have we had now?
The program recounted the history of what it called the nation's climate policy over the past decade or so. In fact, it examined machinations around attempts to implement an emissions trading scheme. Despite crucial errors of omission - such as not mentioning how the destruction of global consensus at Copenhagen in 2009 changed the national mood and policy imperative - it did a reasonable job of retelling this history. Critical of the Greens for voting down Kevin Rudd's emissions scheme, it did not make enough of Rudd's cowardice in not taking it to a double-dissolution election.
But the central premise of the program - that the inability to -entrench an ETS was a national failure - was never demon-strated. "What climate policy?" mused Martin Parkinson, who headed the departments of Climate Change, Treasury and Prime Minister and Cabinet. "I mean, it's basically â€¦ a mess. It's incoherent and has been for a decade." Up to a point he is correct, although it is far from clear whether this has been detrimental.
Four Corners was not interested in that debate. Its starting -assumption was that a price on carbon is a "reform" we need. The program ignored significant areas of bipartisan climate policy consensus. Australia signed the Kyoto Protocol, eventually ratified it and met its emissions reduction targets (one of only 36 nations to do so), while also introducing, implementing and expanding the renewable energy target, and then ratifying the Paris climate agreement and a new emissions target of at least 26 per cent by 2030.
These are not small developments. Surely they demand consideration in any climate policy assessment. Four Corners also ignored the actual outcomes. If you argue it is a monumental failure not to have an ETS to cut emissions, then surely an examination of emissions is mandatory.
"Australia's emissions for the year to September 2019 have declined 15.4 per cent since the peak in the year to June 2007 and were 1.0 per cent below emissions in 2000 and 13.1 per cent below emissions in 2005," says the latest -National Greenhouse Inventory.
"In the year to September 2019, emissions per capita and the -emissions intensity of the economy were at their lowest levels in 29 years," the inventory adds.
It betrays much about the ABC agenda that none of this was -examined. Four Corners and the ABC view the imposition of a price on carbon as an end in itself. "We have failed, no doubt about that â€¦ we've all failed â€¦ I still feel gutted," lamented another former Treasury secretary, Ken Henry. "The reason I feel angry about it is that I feel angry about what Australia has lost." But Four Corners failed to consider what Australia lost.
We know we are one of relatively few nations that has met its global undertakings and reduced emissions. We also know - although, in perhaps its gravest omission, this was never mentioned by Four Corners - that global greenhouse emissions have grown dramatically over the past decade.
In other words, we have lost nothing, certainly environmentally, and probably economically.
If a global consensus emerges, we have time to adjust our policies; and if, as some argue, we need deeper reductions, they will hardly matter until global emissions stop growing.
Despite these realities, Four Corners and the ABC insinuate a big lie: that Australian inaction can and has had an impact on our -climate. This is an illogical and scientifically unsustainable proposition, yet it is repeatedly made as natural disasters are appropriated into an ideological and partisan campaign for a price on carbon.
Four Corners also raised tired old media conspiracies, allowing Malcolm Turnbull to again portray himself as a climate martyr at the hands of News Corp and others. Brissenden put Julia Gillard's demise down to the same nonsense: "Gillard was punished by some sections of the media and slumped badly in the polls." With no mention of how Gillard lost control of Australia's borders and finances, Four Corners went with the pretence that she suffered only from the Coalition unfairly labelling her carbon price as a tax. This omits the pertinent fact that it was Gillard herself who did that - on the ABC. "With this carbon tax, you do concede it's a carbon tax, do you not?" asked Heather Ewart on 7.30 in February 2011. "Oh look, I'm happy to use the word tax, Heather," she said. It was a staggering and costly political error. An own goal that opened up Gillard and Labor to a fierce political attack from Tony Abbott for the next two years.

Climate change question: how green is my portfolio?

Eco-friendly investments are relatively unexplored, writes John Owen
HOW does climate change impact your investment, and how does your investment impact climate change?
While the investment industry has been doing a lot of research on these issues, it's been largely from a shares perspective.
Other asset classes have been relatively neglected, and therefore the implications of climate change for investment portfolios as a whole remain relatively unexplored.
This article highlights the ways climate change could impact all the asset classes that typically appear in client portfolios.
It gives an overview of the investment risks and opportunities investors should anticipate as we move towards a lower-carbon economy and identifies the pitfalls that could occur along the way.
Investors should not regard themselves as passive passengers on this journey, but can use their collective investment clout if they desire to affect the course of climate change.
Climate change as an issue is here to stay and more and more businesses are thinking about the impact it will have on them. Oil price rices force government to search for clean, renewable alternative energy sources, and consumers are also shifting their preferences towards greener products and services, and assessing a company's environmental reputation when deciding who they purchase from.
Some investors are starting to consider reducing their exposure to sectors and companies that are highly carbon-intensive and unwilling to adapt.
In contrast, they are also thinking of ways to invest in green technology and climate-friendly industries they might benefit from.
In the past, the investment industry has often confined environmentally and socially aware investment practices to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) themed funds. But this limited approach is no longer appropriate as the ``theme'' is now Planet Earth.
Therefore, climate change should be moved on to the mainstream investment agenda and the way it can affect the valuation of all asset classes should be considered.
The first step is to understand how our decisions on where to invest our money exposes us to carbon risk.
According to various surveys, the average Australian superannuation fund invests 60 per cent-plus of total assets in shares. Add an approximate 10 per cent allocation to company bonds and we very quickly get to a 70 per cent-plus exposure to companies. Any adverse impact from climate change on these underlying companies will have a significant effect on the performance of client's investment portfolios. That is not to say that other assets are sheltered from the storm.
Property investments, for instance, are even more significantly exposed to both regulatory and physical impacts.
In the case of equities, carbon risk needs to be worked into the way you price shares (and whether they are cheap or not). An assessment of ``climate'' related risks should now be included, along with regulatory, technology and physical risks.
Regulatory risk results from the impact of government policies that put a price on the carbon emissions a company makes, or which directly regulate products and processes that are emitting green house gases (GHG).
Technology risk suggests companies that can exploit new demand for climate-friendly products and services could thrive, while those trapped with older and dirtier technologies could suffer.
While research into the impact of climate change on shares is important, the impact on other assets shouldn't be ignored.
Take fixed interest (bonds), where climate change could have both positive and negative impacts. New investment opportunities could arise, such as bonds issued by governments and project development companies to finance green technology development.
Within the corporate fixed-income markets, investors could choose to reduce their exposure to company bond issuers that face heightened credit risk because of regulation or the physical impacts of climate change over time, such as companies that operate in geographic areas that may suffer catastrophe risk from rising sea levels or windstorms.
Out of all the asset classes, property is the most exposed to the two primary categories of climate change risk: physical and regulatory. It is estimated that property is the conduit for about half of total GHG emissions through its construction, use and demolition.
To date, property valuations and pricing by the market have been slow to reflect the benefits of low-energy buildings or account for the risks of accelerated obsolescence of energy-inefficient buildings.
However, this is starting to change. Most buildings are being equipped with higher-efficiency fittings, and governments are beginning to enforce energy standards to reduce waste.
Investors should be aware that energy-efficient buildings may receive a valuation premium to those that aren't, or whose owners refuse to spend to upgrade and improve their carbon emissions.
As for the private equity sector, rivers of green money are already flowing its way. In North America, ``greentech'' has become the fifth-largest venture capital investment category and is estimated to grow from some $US40 billion to $US170 billion by 2015.
Clearly, lots of ``green'' investment opportunities will emerge. California's tough carbon price signal has set Silicon Valley buzzing with clean technology projects, including energy-storage systems, devices for making electricity grids more intelligent, enzymes that convert plant material to ethanol and algae that can be turned into fuel.
Climate change as an investment issue is complex -- there will be winners and losers. Rivers of green money do not guarantee a good return for investors -- there will be opportunities and risky situations with poor return profiles that investors should avoid.
That is why investors should not hesitate delegating the management of climate change risk to good, experienced, active managers who have the resources to devote to assessing the investment implications. That also means investors should ensure their managers are not just paying lip-service to the issue but are actually incorporating climate change considerations into their analysis and decision making.
As always, allowing them to innovatively construct a portfolio without constraints that results in a well-diversified portfolio will go a long way towards managing the risks and exploiting the opportunities presented by climate change.
John Owen, MLC investment analyst
AT A GLANCE
PLANET EARTH: Take a whole view of climate change when preparing investment portfolios.
ASSETS ALIGN: Rising climate awareness will change views on all asset classes, not simply those stock market-related.
CARBON RISK: Along with new technology, could cast older industries into investor shade.
DELEGATE: Choose active experienced portfolio managers.

ACCURATE REPORTING ON CLIMATE CHANGE MUST INCLUDE ECONOMIC FACTS
The Australian

Whose interests are editors at the climate catastrophist Guardian, the Nine Network newspapers and ABC radio and television representing when they publish climate alarmist stories but never question the economic costs of policies they support?
Failure to think of the costs of climate action cost the Labor Party dearly at the May 18 federal election. Former leader Bill Shorten refused to reveal the cost of his proposed 50 per cent CO2 reduction target by 2030, telling reporters the real question was what would be the cost of not taking such action.
Back in the Howard years many in the media understood the Coalition's proposed emissions trading scheme taken to the 2007 election aimed for "least cost abatement". Economic cost was the main reason 15 years ago I started publishing Bjorn Lomborg, director of the Copenhagen Consensus Centre. Lomborg's analysis of costs and benefits should be one of the barometers by which Paul Barry's Media Watch measures media climate reporting.
But at The Guardian, which has swallowed the least likely scenario from the International Panel on Climate Change to sign on to a "climate emergency" by 2030, cost and effectiveness of action just don't enter into it. It told readers last Tuesday under the headline "It's time to act" that "We want the Guardian to play a leading role in reporting on the environmental catastrophe". US editor John Mulholland said: "The climate crisis is the defining issue of our lifetimes, and informs all our journalism." He was not exaggerating.
The Guardian supports the most expensive solutions knowing they will do almost nothing to change the climate. Even if adopted in full, they will remove only 1 per cent of the CO2 that would need to be mitigated to meet the IPCC's 2C warming target. This is the worst kind of "look at me" media gesture politics.
Let's check some facts: 1. The 2030 Paris Agreement will cost the world between $US1 trillion and $US2 trillion a year by 2030 to reduce total CO2 emissions by just 1 per cent, removing 60 billion tonnes of CO2 when 6000 billion tonnes need to be removed to limit warming to 2C. If the world did nothing the total cost according to the UN's own climate science panel would be the equivalent of a reduction in incomes of between 0.2 and 2 per cent over the next 50 years. Not nothing but not the end of the world either.
2. Lomborg says since the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit tens of billions a year have been spent on solar and wind energy but the proportion of global energy derived from renewables has risen only from 13 to 14 per cent. Most of that 14 per cent is hydro-electric power or the burning of wood. Yet this year alone the "world will spend â€¦ $230bn subsidising renewable energy, propping up inefficient industries and supporting middle-class homeowners to erect solar panels".
3. The Parliamentary Library in Canberra in late 2017 reported 621 new generation units were under construction at coal-fired power stations globally. Steaming and coking coal are Australia's biggest export industry. Despite constant false media predictions the coal industry will soon die, why no Media Watch denouncing of such false reporting?
4. Industry Super, no friend of the Coalition, reported in June in favour of a nuclear power industry because of problems associated with renewables. We have among the highest penetrations of renewables in the world, but you would not know from reporting by the ABC or Guardian. The intermittent nature of wind and solar power is affecting the reliability of the national grid. Renewables advocates say viable storage technologies will arrive eventually. Industry Super says Australia would need 100 Snowy 2.0 projects at a cost of $700bn just to power the nation for a day and a half. We could build 150 nuclear power stations for that. Looking at South Australia's giant Tesla battery, nationwide battery storage would cost $6.5 trillion (trillion that is, so four times total annual GDP) to power us for a day and a half.
5. No matter what Australia, with 1.3 per cent of global emissions, does, CO2 emissions will continue to rise because of growth in China and India. As developing countries, they are allowed to keep increasing emissions to 2030. The idea that in such circumstances Australia can help stop a global "mass extinction" is ludicrous, and editors should demand environment writers call it out. If the UN really thought a mass extinction was near it would immediately renegotiate climate agreements with developing countries.
Mentioning economic facts is not climate denial. But not mentioning such facts does constitute denial of economic reality. Lomborg says the answer is increased spending on research and development to create technologies that can help remove CO2.
At least one Guardian writer hit on an honest answer over a decade ago. George Monbiot, a climate alarmist, conceded, correctly, that anyone who really believes climate change is an existential threat needs to come to terms with nuclear power. This was more honest than trying to make political points linking every drought, flood and storm to climate change, as if mankind had not faced such natural weather variability for thousands of years.
The best environment writers used to represent all sides of a story. The late Brian Woodley at this newspaper was renowned for maintaining strong relationships with logging workers, the timber industry and the green lobbies in his forestry industry reporting.
Environment writers should accurately report what climate scientists say. But they should also report what economists and scientists in disciplines such as physics, astronomy and geology say. Climate science is a relatively new field and many in it know their computer modelling is far from perfect. The sun and the Earth's core are the main sources of heat on our planet, so media sneering at reporting of the work of astronomers and geologists on climate is infantile.
Throughout human history, confronted with ocean flooding, humans have built levies to prevent inundation or moved to higher ground. Only very recently have scientists persuaded otherwise rational people the answer is to try to alter ocean levels by eating less meat, using less fossil fuel, flying less or driving an electric car.
Apart from the fact that many ocean specialists do not accept sea levels are rising and there is ample tidal evidence that in some places they are in fact falling (such as in the middle of Sydney Harbour) not all climate scientists agree on the solution. Prominent climate scientist Professor Judith Curry, once an IPCC lead author, had another suggestion in her testimony to the US congress in February. How about building more resilience into our coastal developments for a start?
Curry, who says CO2 will warm the planet eventually but the worst effects will not be felt until 2100, believes CO2 cannot be regarded as a thermostat for the world's temperature. That's why less experienced scientists are trying to deplatform her.Yet there may soon be more deplatforming in the other direction. The evidence from London last week suggests the public is too smart for some of the media hype on climate. Extinction Rebellion protesters may themselves be "deplatformed" by people who have had enough of economic envy dressed up as climate concern.

QBE issues climate change alert

QBE has warned of the material risk climate change poses to its business as it revealed it has -already burned through its first-quarter catastrophe allowance due to the bushfires that have raged across Australia this -summer.
Chief executive Pat Regan said climate change was one of the biggest challenges facing QBE as he called for insurers and government to keep insurance affordable in high-risk areas and increase mitigation activity.
"Climate change is a global risk that has had, and will continue to have, ramifications around the world. It is a material risk for QBE and across our operations," Mr Regan said.
"Governments always want insurers to have lower premiums and insurers always want governments to do more mitigation. I'd like to see more mitigation generally, (including) flood prevention. No doubt both sides will do more over time." Globally, the costs from natural disasters have exceeded the 30-year average for seven of the past 10 years, while the number of extreme weather events globally has tripled since the 1980s.
"Already we've used up a bit more than our full quarter allowance in January and the first part of February," Mr Regan said, adding he was not yet "unduly concerned" about the spike.
While warning of the prospect of insurance premiums becoming unaffordable in disaster-prone regions, Mr Regan flagged that premiums across the board would be affected by the more frequent and severe natural disasters.
"There have always been -places that are much more prone to flooding and bushfires," he said.
"It's exacerbated now because events are more severe and it does threaten to make insurance in those areas unaffordable.
"What we've got to buy into is there's an element of community pricing you've got to have, you can't just leave communities excluded from insurers. Implicitly, what we'll say is we're not going to make areas uninsurable and we'll factor that into the broader portfolio pricing." Mr Regan's comments come a week after Suncorp chief executive Steve Johnston called for a federally funded program in the May budget to improve infrastructure and the resilience of communities in the wake of the recent natural disasters. "The irony is you can get a subsidy to put a solar panel on your roof but you can't get a subsidy to batten that roof down to protect it against a category four or category five cyclone," Mr Johnston said.
On Thursday, RBA governor Philip Lowe warned of the economic implications of climate change. "Addressing climate change isn't something that's any responsibility of the Reserve Bank, but what we do have a responsibility to do is to understand the economic and the financial implication of climate change," Dr Lowe said.
"The economic implications in Australia are profound. The world is getting hotter and the climate is more variable. We're seeing already in Australia, perhaps more than anywhere else in the world, the effects of that." QBE on Monday posted a 41 per cent lift in net profit for the 12 months to the end of December to $US550m ($817m), on revenue of $US15.2bn, down 1 per cent following the divestment of its insurance divisions in Indonesia and The Philippines, as well as the wool and livestock-in-transit businesses in Australia during the year.
Shares in the insurer surged following the result and closed up 4.31 per cent at $14.76.
On a continuing basis, the group posted a combined operating ratio of 97.5 per cent for the year, above the target range of 94.5-96.5 per cent.
A combined operating ratio is a key measure of profitability. It compares claims and other costs to total premiums. If the ratio is more than 100 per cent, it indicates the underwriting activity is unprofitable.
Australia's recent bushfires contributed to the higher ratio, as did adverse weather in the US, QBE said.
The insurer in December warned that its US crop division's 2019 combined operating ratio would blow out on higher-than-expected claims and adverse weather conditions, pushing the ratio for the entire group above its target range. But QBE still sees the 2020 combined operating ratio coming in at 93.5-95.5 per cent.
Gross written premium fell 2 per cent in the year to $13.4bn, but was up 2 per cent on a constant currency basis.
It recorded an average renewal rate increase of 6.3 per cent, with premium rate momentum accelerating during the year, most notably in Europe and North America.
Commenting on the result, Mr Regan pointed to the poor weather conditions in the US, which he said detracted from the positive momentum in the business.
"Regrettably, this weighed on the group's underwriting result, despite very good pricing momentum and a strong investment performance in an otherwise challenging global interest rate environment," he said.
"Despite the impact of adverse weather conditions on our North American crop business, the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong and we continue to see improvement in both the quality and resilience of our earnings." He noted the progress the business had made by slimming down and refocusing its operations in 2019 and said it was well positioned heading into 2020, "with strong prospects for further sustainable margin improvement". QBE would focus on growing organically in 2020, he added.
Bell Potter analyst TS Lim said he was encouraged by the company's outlook for the year ahead.
"It was a pretty good result," Mr Lim told The Australian. "I liked the outlook statement, they're pointing to [premium] rate rises and also more efficiency gains.
"I think if you look past all the noise of last year, when there were a lot of claims coming through, they have maintained the guidance and the pricing momentum is important because it shows top line is growing strongly.
"The surprise factor (on the profit) was the bushfires in December. (But) the attritional claims are still going down so I think that's a positive sign. Capital is strong, it's been de-risking and it shows they're doing the right thing." Updating shareholders on its catastrophe models, QBE said it had made adjustments to factor in the expected impacts of climate change out to 2100. From modelling done to date, under an estimated 2-3 per cent rise in global mean temperatures, it said it did not expect material increases in claims costs as a result of cyclones in Australia before 2050.
"Annual claims cost related to hurricanes and tropical cyclones could go up by more than 50 per cent in the second half of the century, with a wide variation in local impact, and a rate of change that will depend on how the global community addresses this critical challenge," the insurer said.
Mr Regan confirmed it would be modelling the potential impact of bushfires in the coming months.QBE will pay a final dividend of 27c a share, 30 per cent franked, bringing the full-year dividend to 52c a share.

Mr Regan's comments come a week after Suncorp chief executive Steve Johnston called for a federally funded program in the May budget to improve infrastructure and the resilience of communities in the wake of the recent natural disasters. "The irony is you can get a subsidy to put a solar panel on your roof but you can't get a subsidy to batten that roof down to protect it against a category four or category five cyclone," Mr Johnston said.
On Thursday, RBA governor Philip Lowe warned of the economic implications of climate change. "Addressing climate change isn't something that's any responsibility of the Reserve Bank, but what we do have a responsibility to do is to understand the economic and the financial implication of climate change," Dr Lowe said.
"The economic implications in Australia are profound. The world is getting hotter and the climate is more variable. We're seeing already in Australia, perhaps more than anywhere else in the world, the effects of that." QBE on Monday posted a 41 per cent lift in net profit for the 12 months to the end of December to $US550m ($817m), on revenue of $US15.2bn, down 1 per cent following the divestment of its insurance divisions in Indonesia and The Philippines, as well as the wool and livestock-in-transit businesses in Australia during the year.
Shares in the insurer surged following the result and closed up 4.31 per cent at $14.76.
On a continuing basis, the group posted a combined operating ratio of 97.5 per cent for the year, above the target range of 94.5-96.5 per cent.
A combined operating ratio is a key measure of profitability. It compares claims and other costs to total premiums. If the ratio is more than 100 per cent, it indicates the underwriting activity is unprofitable.
Australia's recent bushfires contributed to the higher ratio, as did adverse weather in the US, QBE said.
The insurer in December warned that its US crop division's 2019 combined operating ratio would blow out on higher-than-expected claims and adverse weather conditions, pushing the ratio for the entire group above its target range. But QBE still sees the 2020 combined operating ratio coming in at 93.5-95.5 per cent.
Gross written premium fell 2 per cent in the year to $13.4bn, but was up 2 per cent on a constant currency basis.
It recorded an average renewal rate increase of 6.3 per cent, with premium rate momentum accelerating during the year, most notably in Europe and North America.
Commenting on the result, Mr Regan pointed to the poor weather conditions in the US, which he said detracted from the positive momentum in the business.
"Regrettably, this weighed on the group's underwriting result, despite very good pricing momentum and a strong investment performance in an otherwise challenging global interest rate environment," he said.
"Despite the impact of adverse weather conditions on our North American crop business, the underlying fundamentals of our business remain strong and we continue to see improvement in both the quality and resilience of our earnings." He noted the progress the business had made by slimming down and refocusing its operations in 2019 and said it was well positioned heading into 2020, "with strong prospects for further sustainable margin improvement". QBE would focus on growing organically in 2020, he added.
Bell Potter analyst TS Lim said he was encouraged by the company's outlook for the year ahead.
"It was a pretty good result," Mr Lim told The Australian. "I liked the outlook statement, they're pointing to [premium] rate rises and also more efficiency gains.
"I think if you look past all the noise of last year, when there were a lot of claims coming through, they have maintained the guidance and the pricing momentum is important because it shows top line is growing strongly.
"The surprise factor (on the profit) was the bushfires in December. (But) the attritional claims are still going down so I think that's a positive sign. Capital is strong, it's been de-risking and it shows they're doing the right thing." Updating shareholders on its catastrophe models, QBE said it had made adjustments to factor in the expected impacts of climate change out to 2100. From modelling done to date, under an estimated 2-3 per cent rise in global mean temperatures, it said it did not expect material increases in claims costs as a result of cyclones in Australia before 2050.
"Annual claims cost related to hurricanes and tropical cyclones could go up by more than 50 per cent in the second half of the century, with a wide variation in local impact, and a rate of change that will depend on how the global community addresses this critical challenge," the insurer said.
Mr Regan confirmed it would be modelling the potential impact of bushfires in the coming months.
QBE will pay a final dividend of 27c a share, 30 per cent franked, bringing the full-year dividend to 52c a share.The final dividend is up 2c a share on 2018's payout, but the second-half dividend is lower than last year's 28c a share.

Climate change suspect must be given a fair trial

Scientists need to compete to make the best, most accurate predictions, not the most alarming ones
GOVERNMENTS across the world have paid billions to find links between carbon dioxide and the climate, but very little to find the opposite, and that's a problem. Teams of professionals have searched high and low for any possible hint that CO2 poses a threat, and that is all very well, but no one has been paid to find otherwise. CO2 has been convicted without a defence lawyer.
It is self-evident that any expert in a field will reap more rewards, fame and fortune if their field is critically important. Why would anyone expect such experts to go out of their way to hunt down evidence that might suggest their field ought not be the centre of a global economic transformation?
When results come in that conflict with catastrophic model predictions, hordes of researchers scour every nook and cranny to find early warm biases, or recent cold biases, and they may legitimately find some. But no one is paid to hunt down the errors or biases leading the other way. The vacuum sucks.
Did anyone really expect that teams of volunteers without offices, budgets, access to data or PR writers would spontaneously arise and point out any flaws? Would people with the right training choose to forgo Sunday golf in order to download Hadley radio-sonde data and shoot holes in the national temperature record? Actually, they would and they have, but it's taken years to build, and it's a silly way to run the country. This was always a loophole begging to be exploited.
We wouldn't let a company issue a prospectus without being audited. But we'll transform the national economy based on a report issued by a foreign committee that no one has been paid to criticise. There are no audits on the science from institutions like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NASA or the CSIRO. No due diligence study has been done. Hallowed peer review amounts to unpaid anonymous reviewers, often picked from a pool of people who agree.
Where is the Institute of Natural Climate Forces, or the International Bureau of Solar Science? Where are the researchers whose reputations and grants rise in value if they find holes in the theory of man-made global warming?
If, hypothetically, there are scientific gaps in the theory of man-made global warming, for the most part we are leaving it up to volunteers to find them. It's as if the government has funded a team of QCs for the prosecution, but spent nothing on legal aid for the defence.
In law, if there is no defence, it's a sham.
In business, if there is no competition, it's a monopoly.
In science, if there is no debate, it's propaganda.
Between 1989 and 2009, the US government paid over $30 billion towards ``climate change''. And don't be fooled by the meaning of ``climate change'', which ought to encompass all the factors that change the climate. The inherent bias in the system is so strong that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change actually defines ``climate change'' as being ``man-made''. I kid you not.
``Climate change'' means a change of climate, which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.
The IPCC was originally established to investigate things ``relevant to the understanding of the risk of human-induced climate change''. That was their mandate. They would have no reason to exist if there's no disaster, and they were never going to announce that they studied it all and golly, but it's all OK Chipper, and we're headed home. Thanks for the funding!
What committee ever voted for its own extinction?
When the very term ``climate change'' means man-made, the mindset is biased. It's a one-way road to an endless circle of confirmation bias. The Orwellian overtones are extreme: How do you ask ``what causes climate change?'' and get any answer other than ``man-made''?
Where are the programs to find out if man-made emissions didn't cause global warming?
When people ask ``how can thousands of scientists be wrong?'' they forget that a consensus on a highly complex, immature subject can be purchased, or unwittingly created. If a government spent $30bn to find better uses for carrots, there would be carrot appreciation societies, carrot conventions, 400 patents on carrot-based wing-nuts, tents, and textiles, and 4000 peer-reviewed references on worrying declines in carrot hue, nutrients, fertility and genetic diversity, not to mention gender inequality in dietary carrot content.
That's not to say that excessive one-sided funding proves anything about the climate, but nor does the existence of a consensus of government-paid climate scientists.
We've paid to find a crisis, and what-do-you-know, we ``found'' one. (Yes. It's true, we got what we paid for.) Hundreds of scientists have been doing their jobs, most diligently, turning over every stone labelled ``CO2''. But no one has been paid to turn over the other stones.
When politicians and journalists say they can't find a credible voice of dissent, it's only because they define ``credible'' as someone holding a government-funded position -- and by definition, there are no government-funded sceptics.
US president Dwight Eisenhower warned against government domination of science in his farewell speech in 1961: ``In this [technological] revolution, research has become central, it also becomes more formalised, complex and costly. A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the federal government.''
Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity.
The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present.
The so-called ``free market'' leaders of the world missed the need for healthy competition in science. Their big mistake on climate policy was failing to see the effect of monopoly science. They could have set up institutes and research centres whose aim was to find non-man-made causes of climate change.
These alternate institutes and conventions would compete with the usual grant applicants for research, and it would be in their interest to find reasons the climate was changed by the sun, or geomagnetic effects or orbital changes, or who knows? Through natural competition (and may the best argument win) we'd have learned more about our climate, and we'd prevent a climate monopoly from potentially skewing the research.
As with all unbalanced systems, people are rushing to fill the vacuum. The volunteers are coming. Never before in science have so many unpaid people used their expertise to become whistleblowers.
As Eisenhower feared, government has come to dominate science. We need organisations that are timeless centres of excellence, rather than crisis-response teams. Groups of scientists need to compete to make the best, most accurate predictions, not the most alarming ones.
One thing is for sure, the mess of climate science needs to be cleaned up and we need to find ways to fund science that don't pre-empt the answers, or stifle competition.

Business embraces change - CLIMATE CHANGE - SPECIAL REPORT - BUSINESS & ENVIRONMENT PART 1

MATP
ALCOA was recently named by Fortune magazine as one of the world's most admired companies for the 24th year in a row. It is an accolade the global aluminium giant savours and one it would like to also see for climate change initiatives.
Climate change is not just a concept embraced by politicians and an increasingly interested public. For years now companies such as Exxon, Alcoa, BP, Shell, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto have been calling for a co-ordinated global approach to climate change.
The Minerals Council of Australia and a number of major corporates, including Alcoa, all recently made submissions to the Prime Minister's Task Group on Emissions Trading and have called for the introduction of a properly designed emissions trading scheme.
The main caveat is that unilateral action by Australia would be ineffective in addressing climate change, and may cause undue damage to the Australian economy. The MCA argues ''early action in establishing a framework of policies and measures may be necessary to enable Australia to play a critical leadership role in the development of global solutions, particularly in the development and deployment of new abatement technologies''.
In the United States the US Climate Action Partnership -- comprised of major corporates and non-government organisations -- recently called on the US Government to introduce ''a mandatory and flexible climate program that would target major emitting sectors including emissions from large stationary sources, transportation, and energy use in commercial and residential buildings that could be phased in over time, with set short, medium and long term target horizons''.
The US move came on back of the June 2005 statement by the US National Academy of Sciences, and with the scientific academies of 10 other countries that states ''the scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt actions''.
The corporate approach to climate change has a number of drivers. Primarily, the corporates want to get the rules laid down now while there is still time to enact change in a measured and global response.
The worst-case scenario for the corporate world would be for climate change to travel along its present course of ad-hoc initiatives, and some catastrophic future environmental effect cause a sudden knee-jerk reaction from governments -- for which businesses would not have time to prepare.
But there are also other factors, including profit. The US group reached a conclusion that ''In our view, the climate change challenge will create more economic opportunities than risks for the US economy''.
Alcoa Australia manager environment and sustainable development, Tim McAuliffe, says that in today's environment modern companies must have a social conscience and be active in conservation and environmental initiatives to operate effectively.
Climate change is the issue of the century, so corporates cannot afford to give lip service to solutions.
''Alcoa is lining up with other major corporates to attract the best and brightest coming out of the universities. However, the graduates want to know the company's environmental credentials and read its policies in areas like climate change before signing up'', says McAuliffe.
Government's also like to know they are dealing with responsible corporates that are not going to cause electoral backlashes through poor environmental practices.
Alcoa already has runs on the board. In 1990 it set a 2010 target to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 25 per cent. It achieved its target in 2003 and its new target is to be carbon emissions neutral by 2020.
The neutral emission target would largely be set by aluminium increasing its market share of content in car manufacture. Each additional kilogram of aluminium used in cars represents a weight saving that equates to a net 20kg reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the life of the car, with the added bonus of cheaper running costs for consumers due to less fuel consumption.
Alcoa's Australian operations are some of its most significant and local research and development in Western Australia has led to numerous new technologies being rolled out in Alcoa's operations worldwide.
A new technology recently developed at the Kwinana operations in Western Australia promises to significantly increase Alcoa's arsenal of weapons for battling greenhouse emissions.
The technology allows Alcoa to strip carbon dioxide from the waste stream at the plant and inject it into the 25 million tonnes a year of bauxite residue the plant produces. The residue is not toxic, but it is highly alkaline and requires long-term storage.
The new process of locking the CO2 into the residue also reduces the pH level of the material, making the material inert and removing the storage issue. Alcoa has yet to make an announcement, but it is currently trialling the treated material as a road base and building material.
Alcoa already has a trial plant in operation at Kwinana that is expected to lock up 70,000 tonnes of CO2 each year, equivalent to removing 12,000 cars off the road.
Alcoa is still working on how to apply the technology to removing C02 from refinery emissions, but once rolled out emission savings just from its Australian operations are expected to be about 300,000 tonnes a year, the equivalent of removing 75,000 cars off the road.

Regions at war harder hit by climate change

Climate change is unfair. Conflict is cruel. Together they're devastating. This combined threat may be beyond the lived experience of many Australians. But it's a reality we need to acknowledge, because the lives of millions of people, who live oceans away, caught between conflict and climate change depend on it.
In 2020, Australians endured a brutal bushfire season. The world remains in the grips of global pandemic. If nothing else, this year has shown that collective challenges demand collective responses. Australia's pain is real, but the world feels it, too. We're in this together. When it comes to conflict and climate change, this message couldn't matter more. As Australians, we need to embrace this shared responsibility.
We need to embrace this responsibility because around the world people will experience climate change differently. Some will be hit harder than others. Some will have the capacity to adapt and respond - others will not. What we know is this: of the 20 countries deemed most vulnerable to climate change, more than half of them are mired in conflict. And conflict reduces the capacity of people to adapt, to respond collectively.
If you're fighting with your neighbour, it's almost impossible to work together. This is why conflict and climate change are a double threat. They overlap; they compound. And if years of conflict have shattered not only lives, but also communities, markets, schools and hospitals then the prospects of a collective response to unpredictable weather patterns and extreme weather events are grim. Climate change doesn't occur in a vacuum - its impact is made worse by conflict.
Around the world, my colleagues with the International Committee of the Red Cross witness the impact of climate shocks on a daily basis in the conflict zones where we work. As an organisation that helps people caught in conflict, we have no choice but to face the challenge of climate change and untangle what it means for our work with people affected by violence. It is increasingly clear that the communities we work with are disproportionately affected by climate change. And while research doesn't show that climate change causes conflict, there is general agreement that it may indirectly increase the risk of violence by exacerbating existing tensions.
In the west African country of Mali, living conditions are difficult even in peacetime. The hardship of decades of desertification, rare and unpredictable rainfall and a lack of infrastructure is made worse by a long-lasting conflict. When times are good, pastoralists and their herds of cattle would be able to travel far to find grazing land and water. This year, due to the insecurity caused by conflict, they cannot. Trapped in place, their animals perish, and people become destitute. Across Africa, these dynamics can fuel tensions between herder and farming communities as competition for scarce resources grows.
Sometimes, even the natural environment is targeted by war. In Iraq, people attribute hardship in farming and water access to the deliberate cutting down of date palms or drying of marshlands as reprisals against the civilian population in the 1990s. With fragile infrastructure, weakened by years of war, these long-lasting scars from conflict are now exacerbated by climate trends - higher temperatures and less rain. "Before, rain was falling," one of my Iraqi colleagues has mused. "Now, dust is falling." If conflict and climate change are beyond our lived experience in Australia, we need to broaden our circle of empathy to include those who live that reality every day. We need to encourage climate action to include global communities affected by conflict.
Think of the good work that Australian civil society has done helping people affected by the bushfires. Whether you're an artist, activist, engineer or politician, this is work we can replicate on a global scale. This is about ensuring no one gets left behind.

Sorry, but I cried wolf on climate change

On behalf of environmentalists everywhere, I would like to formally apologise for the climate scare we created over the past 30 years. Climate change is happening. It's just not the end of the world. It's not even our most serious environmental problem.
I may seem like a strange person to be saying all of this. I have been a climate activist for 20 years and an environmentalist for 30.
But as an energy expert asked by the US congress to provide -objective testimony, and invited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to serve as a reviewer of its next assessment report, I feel an obligation to apologise for how badly we environmentalists have misled the public.
Here are some facts few people know: Humans are not causing a "sixth mass extinction"; The Amazon is not "the lungs of the world"; Climate change is not making natural disasters worse; Fires have declined 25 per cent around the world since 2003; The amount of land we use for meat - humankind's biggest use of land - has declined by an area nearly as large as Alaska; The build-up of wood fuel and more houses near forests, not climate change, explain why there are more, and more dangerous, fires in Australia and California; Carbon emissions are declining in most rich nations and have been declining in Britain, Germany and France since the mid-1970s; The Netherlands became rich, not poor, while adapting to life below sea level; We produce 25 per cent more food than we need and food surpluses will continue to rise as the world gets hotter; Habitat loss and the direct killing of wild animals are bigger threats to species than climate change; Wood fuel is far worse for people and wildlife than fossil fuels; Preventing future pandemics requires more, not less, "industrial" agriculture. I know the above facts will sound like "climate denialism" to many people. But that just shows the power of climate alarmism. In reality, the above facts come from the best-available scientific studies, including those -conducted by or accepted by the IPCC, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the Inter-national Union for the Conservation of Nature and other leading scientific bodies.
Some people will, when they read this, imagine that I'm some right-wing anti-environmentalist. I'm not. At 17, I lived in Nicaragua to show solidarity with the Sandinista socialist revolution. At 23 I raised money for Guatemalan women's co-operatives. In my early 20s I lived in the semi-Amazon doing research with small farmers fighting land invasions. At 26 I helped expose poor conditions at Nike factories in Asia.
Green beginnings I became an environmentalist at 16 when I threw a fundraiser for Rainforest Action Network. At 27 I helped save the last unprotected ancient redwoods in California. In my 30s I advocated renewables and successfully helped persuade the Obama administration to -invest $US90bn into them. Over the past few years I helped save enough nuclear plants from being replaced by fossil fuels to prevent a sharp increase in emissions But until last year, I mostly avoided speaking out against the climate scare. Partly that's because I was embarrassed. After all, I am as guilty of alarmism as any other environmentalist. For years, I -referred to climate change as an "existential" threat to human civilisation, and called it a "crisis".
But mostly I was scared. I remained quiet about the climate disinformation campaign because I was afraid of losing friends and funding. The few times I summoned the courage to defend climate science from those who misrepresent it I suffered harsh consequences. And so I mostly stood by and did next to nothing as my fellow environmentalists terrified the public.
I even stood by as people in the White House and many in the media tried to destroy the reputation and career of an outstanding scientist, good man, and friend of mine, Roger Pielke Jr, a lifelong progressive Democrat and environmentalist who testified in favour of carbon regulations. Why did they do that? Because his -research proves natural disasters aren't getting worse. But then, last year, things spiralled out of control. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said: "The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change." Britain's most high-profile environmental group claimed "climate change kills children".
Turning point The world's most influential green journalist, Bill McKibben, called climate change the "greatest challenge humans have ever faced" and said it would "wipe out civilisations". Mainstream journalists -reported, repeatedly, that the Amazon was "the lungs of the world", and that deforestation was like a -nuclear bomb going off.
As a result, half of the people surveyed around the world last year said they thought climate change would make humanity -extinct. And in January, one out of five British children told pollsters they were having nightmares about climate change.
Whether or not you have children you must see how wrong this is. I admit I may be sensitive because I have a teenage daughter. After we talked about the science she was reassured. But her friends are deeply misinformed and thus, understandably, frightened.
I thus decided I had to speak out. I knew that writing a few articles wouldn't be enough. I needed a book to properly lay out all of the evidence. And so my formal -apology for our fearmongering comes in the form of my new book, Apocalypse Never: Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All.
It is based on two decades of research and three decades of environmental activism. At 400 pages, with 100 of them endnotes, Apocalypse Never covers climate change, deforestation, plastic waste, species extinction, industrialisation, meat, nuclear energy, and renewables.
Some highlights from the book: " Factories and modern farming are the keys to human liberation and environmental progress.
" The most important thing for saving the environment is producing more food, particularly meat, on less land.
" The most important thing for reducing pollution and emissions is moving from wood to coal to petrol to natural gas to uranium.
" 100 per cent renewables would require increasing the land used for energy from today's 0.5 per cent to 50 per cent.
" We should want cities, farms, and power plants to have higher, not lower, power densities.
" Vegetarianism reduces one's emissions by less than 4 per cent. " Greenpeace didn't save the whales - switching from whale oil to petroleum and palm oil did.
" "Free-range" beef would require 20 times more land and produce 300 per cent more emissions.
" Greenpeace dogmatism worsened forest fragmentation of the Amazon. " The colonialist approach to gorilla conservation in the Congo produced a backlash that may have resulted in the killing of 250 elephants.
Why were we all so misled? In the final three chapters of Apocalypse Never I expose the -financial, political and ideological motivations. Environmental groups have accepted hundreds of millions of dollars from fossil fuel interests. Groups motivated by anti-humanist beliefs forced the World Bank to stop trying to end poverty and instead make poverty "sustainable". And status anxiety, depression and hostility to modern civilisation are behind much of the alarmism.
Reality bites Once you realise just how badly misinformed we have been, often by people with plainly unsavoury motivations, it is hard not to feel duped. Will Apocalypse Never make any difference? There are certainly reasons to doubt it. The news media have been making apocalyptic pronouncements about climate change since the late 1980s, and do not seem disposed to stop. The ideology behind environmental alarmism - Malthusianism - has been repeatedly debunked for 200 years and yet is more powerful than ever.
But there are also reasons to -believe that environmental alarmism will, if not come to an end, have diminishing cultural power.
A real crisis The coronavirus pandemic is an actual crisis that puts the climate "crisis" into perspective. Even if you think we have overreacted, COVID-19 has killed nearly 500,000 people and shattered economies around the globe.
Scientific institutions including WHO and IPCC have undermined their credibility through the repeated politicisation of science. Their future existence and relevance depends on new leadership and serious reform. Facts still matter, and social media is allowing for a wider range of new and independent voices to outcompete alarmist environmental journalists at legacy publications.
Nations are reverting openly to self-interest and away from Malthusianism and neoliberalism, which is good for nuclear and bad for renewables.
The evidence is overwhelming that our high-energy civilisation is better for people and nature than the low-energy civilisation that climate alarmists would return us to.
The invitations from IPCC and congress are signs of a growing openness to new thinking about climate change and the environment. Another one has been to the response to my book from climate scientists, conservationists and -environmental scholars. "Apocalypse Never is an extremely -important book," writes Richard Rhodes, the Pulitzer-winning -author of The Making of the Atomic Bomb. "This may be the most important book on the environment ever written," says one of the fathers of modern climate science, Tom Wigley.
"We environmentalists condemn those with antithetical views of being ignorant of science and susceptible to confirmation bias," wrote the former head of The Nature Conservancy, Steve McCormick. "But too often we are guilty of the same. Shellenberger offers 'tough love': a challenge to entrenched orthodoxies and rigid, self-defeating mindsets. Apocalypse Never serves up occasionally stinging, but always well-crafted, evidence-based points of view that will help develop the 'mental muscle' we need to envision and design not only a hopeful, but an attainable, future." That is all I hoped for in writing it. If you've made it this far, I hope you'll agree it's perhaps not as strange as it seems that a lifelong environmentalist and progressive felt the need to speak out against the alarmism. I further hope that you'll accept my apology. Michael Shellenberger is president of Environmental Progress, an independent research and policy organisation. He is the author of Apocalypse Never: Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All, published by Harper Collins

Climate change effects unknown

GREAT uncertainty remains about how much of an impact climate change will have on future extreme weather events, the world's leading climate scientists have found.
While there has been an increase in warm days and a decrease in cold nights, the likely impact on future weather events would not be evident for decades because of natural variability, the scientists say in a key review prepared for the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The review of the global climate change literature, prepared as a prelude to the year's biggest climate change conference to be held in Durban in South Africa, says the rising global temperatures can be expected to have an impact.
But it adds: ``Projected changes in climate extremes under different emissions scenarios generally do not strongly diverge in the coming two to three decades, but these signals are relatively small compared with natural climate variability over this timeframe.
``Even the sign of projected changes in some climate extremes over this timeframe is uncertain.''
Releasing a summary of the review last night in Kampala, the Ugandan capital, lead author Thomas Stocker said extreme weather events were some of the most complex phenomena in nature to understand, simulate and predict.
The IPCC report expressed the level of uncertainty attached to future scenarios, Dr Stocker said. But for many phenomena, the picture was very clear and the physical relationship was well understood.
``A changing climate leads to changes in intensity and frequency, spatial extent, duration and timing of extreme weather and climate events, and can result in extreme weather and climate events,'' Dr Stocker said.
``An increase in the frequency and magnitude of warm daily temperature extremes will occur in the 21st century on a global scale. For high-emission scenarios of greenhouse gases, the incidence of hottest days will increase by a factor of four within the next 30 to 40 years and by a factor of 10 by the end of the 21st century.''
IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri said it was ``very likely''

there had been an overall decrease in cold days and nights and an increase in warm days and nights. He said there had clearly been ``statistically significant'' trends in heavy rain events in some regions.
However, Dr Pachauri said there had been ``strong variations to the trend''.
Dr Pachauri described the extreme weather report as ``robust and balanced''.
Global Warming Policy Foundation director Benny Peiser said the overall message was ``there was not a strong empirical link between anthropogenic climate change and weather events''.
``It is unlikely there will be one for 20 to 30 years,'' he said.
He said any suggestion that recent weather events could be directly linked to climate change went directly against the general scientific consensus.
Kathy McInnes, lead author of chapter three -- Changes in Climate Extremes and their Impacts on the Natural Physical Environment -- said a lot of uncertainty remained.
``Extreme events are by nature very rare so we don't have a lot of data that we can assess for a climate change signal,'' Dr McInnes said. ``Depending on the type of extreme, there can be a lot of different contributing factors, some naturally occurring and other human activity that is not necessarily climate change.''
Climate Change Minister Greg Combet last night welcomed the release of the summary document, which he said had found that Australia was projected to experience large increases in the number of days over 35C and 40C and an increase in heatwave duration.
The report said it was likely the frequency of heavy precipitation or the proportion of total rainfall from heavy falls would increase in the 21st century over many areas of the globe.
There was medium confidence some regions had experienced more intense and longer droughts, in particular in southern Europe and West Africa. But elsewhere droughts have become less frequent, less intense or shorter -- for instance, in central North America and northwestern Australia.

Review fails to support climate change link
The Australian

WIDELY-HELD assumptions that climate change is responsible for an upsurge in extreme drought, flood and storm events are not supported by a landmark review of the science.
And a clear climate change signal would not be evident for decades because of natural weather variability.
Despite the uncertainties, politicians -- including US President Barack Obama in his address to federal parliament yesterday -- continue to link major weather events directly to climate change.
Greens leader Bob Brown yesterday highlighted Mr Obama's climate change comments and said the extreme weather impacts were ``not just coming, they are happening''.
But rather than bolster claims of a climate change link, the scientific review prepared by the world's leading climate scientists for the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlights the level of uncertainty. After a week of debate, the IPCC will tonight release a summary of the report in Kampala, Uganda, as a prelude to the year's biggest climate change conference, being held in Durban, South Africa.
The full report will not be released for several months but a leaked copy of the draft summary, details of which have been published by the BBC and a French news agency, have provided a good indication of what it found.
While the human and financial toll of extreme weather events has certainly risen, the cause has been mostly due to increased human settlement rather than worse weather.
There is only ``low confidence'' that tropical cyclones have become more frequent, ``limited to medium evidence available'' to assess whether climatic factors have changed the frequency of floods, and ``low confidence'' on a global scale even on whether the frequency has risen or fallen.
According to the BBC, the draft report said while it was ``likely''

Continued from Page 1
that anthropogenic influences were behind the changes in cold days and warm days, there was only ``medium confidence'' that they were behind changes in extreme rainfall events, and ``low confidence'' in attributing any changes in tropical cyclone activity to greenhouse gas emissions or anything else humanity had done.
The draft report says ``uncertainty in the sign of projected changes in climate extremes over the coming two to three decades is relatively large because climate change signals are expected to be relatively small compared to natural climate variability''.
Jean Palutikof, director of the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility at Griffith University, in Queensland, said the findings of the UN report would ``not surprise anyone involved in climate science''.
Professor Palutikof said it would take a while for the effects of climate change to become visible. But without action, she said, ``gradually, over time, that signal will emerge with resounding clarity''.
``If we don't do something now to prevent it, by the time we get to 2070, we will see the impact clearly,'' she said.
The federal government's climate science adviser, Will Steffen, has acknowledged there is no statistically significant evidence that there has been a change in the behaviour of tropical cyclones.
However, Professor Steffen told the Ten Nework's The Bolt Report at the weekend that most experts agreed we would see an increase in intensity in cyclones as the warming continued.
The draft IPPC summary said if the century progressed without restraints on greenhouse gas emissions, their impacts would come to dominate. It said it was ``very likely'' that the length, frequency and/or intensity of warm spells, including heatwaves, would continue to increase over most land areas.
It was ``likely'' that the frequency of high-rainfall events would increase and mean tropical cyclone maximum wind speed was likely to increase.
There was medium confidence that droughts would intensify.

Tax regime can prompt behaviour change - CLIMATE CHANGE

MANY of Australia's largest corporations will be operating in a carbon-constrained economy from 2010, when an emissions trading scheme (ETS) is planned to operate in Australia. The introduction of climate change initiatives, such as an ETS, challenges Australia's taxation system as it struggles to accommodate new and unfamiliar concepts. The biggest challenge is to ensure the introduction of an ETS does not result in adverse tax outcomes for participants and, indeed, for the broader community.
Necessary tax reforms and tax incentives should be considered concurrently with the development of the ETS. Businesses are starting preparations, in advance of the regulatory scheme's introduction, which includes steps to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and their overall carbon footprint. While no one disputes the broader benefits to the community of such activities, unless they can be clearly linked to the generation of taxable income for the business, such costs may not be tax deductible under the current income tax rules.
A key premise in the current tax system is that tax deductibility revolves around business expenditure that is required to be incurred for a ``profit-making purpose''. Such principles do not easily accommodate voluntary expenditure. Businesses pioneering in the climate change arena, for example, need to show that the costs of going carbon neutral can be linked to increased energy efficiency, enhanced reputation and other factors which contribute to profitability. This is largely because the tax system does not contemplate the relatively recent carbon-oriented transactions which are now occurring. As new transactions are developed, new unintended constraints in the current tax system are coming to light.
An ideal tax system should reinforce policy outcomes and facilitate emission reductions by removing tax impediments. Tax inefficiencies may, for instance, be passed onto electricity consumers in the form of higher electricity costs which may detract from the core objectives of climate change policy. The tax framework accommodating the ETS and associated climate change initiatives should be based on achieving neutral after-tax outcomes for participants.
So what does tax neutrality mean?
It means that the decisions of the market are not influenced by tax factors. Also, there should be no material tax differences between those covered by the ETS as opposed to those who will fall outside the scheme.
However, in practice it may not be feasible to achieve pure tax neutrality. Responsible tax concessions can provide incentives to drive appropriate climate change behaviour. The tax system itself can play a significant role to promote and instigate changes to corporate behaviour by influencing responses to climate change. It can do this through the development of appropriate tax incentives and complementary reforms to the current tax system.
Tax incentives will need to be responsibly integrated into the government's emissions reduction policy. Investors in large capital intensive projects involving new emissions reduction or abatement technology will be looking for tax incentives to mitigate their risks and perhaps ``kick start'' investment in low emissions technologies. These incentives might include favourable tax depreciation rates, research and development tax concessions and possibly an investment allowance.
In France, for example, the capital cost of a wind farm plant can be wholly deducted in the first year of use. In Australia, by comparison, the cost of a wind turbine is generally tax depreciated over an effective life of 20 years.
The tax system itself can play a significant role to promote and instigate changes to corporate behaviour by influencing responses to climate change.
All taxes affect behaviour and all behaviour has environmental effects. We should be thinking in terms of an environmental approach to tax to ensure Australia has a climate change friendly tax system well ahead of the commencement of the ETS in 2010.

PG&E seen as first big company destroyed by climate change
The Australian

PG&E's bankruptcy could mark a business milestone: the first major corporate casualty of climate change. Few people expect it will be the last.
California's largest utility was overwhelmed by rapid climatic changes as a prolonged drought dried out much of the state and decimated forests, dramatically increasing the risk of fire. On Monday, PG&E said it planned to file for Chapter 11 protection by month's end, citing an estimated $US30 billion ($42bn) in liabilities and 750 lawsuits from wildfires potentially caused by its power lines.
The company's fall has been fast. In October, its market value was $US25bn. This week, it was removed from the S&P 500 as its value tumbled below $US4bn and its shares fell to their lowest level since at least 1972.
The PG&E bankruptcy could be a wake-up call for corporations, forcing them to expand how they think about climate-related risks, management consultants said.
Christophe Brognaux, a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, said in the past companies mainly worried over risks from new governmental regulations related to climate change. The PG&E case made clear that companies also had to worry about sudden impacts to their core assets and liabilities, he said.
Bruce Usher, a professor at Columbia University's business school who teaches a course on climate and finance, said: "Physical risks have only recently manifested themselves. This is a fairly new development. If you are not already considering extreme weather and other climatic events as one of many risk factors affecting business today, you are not doing your job." J. Bennett Johnston, a former US senator who has served on Chevron's board of directors, said the potential for climate change to damage company assets was an emerging risk.
"The business community, by and large, has gotten the message," he said. "You have to be pretty stupid not to see we're in the midst of a climate crisis and it's getting worse." Paula DiPerna, a senior adviser to CDP, an international non-profit organisation that presses companies to disclose their environmental impact, said companies and their risk officers should be more aware that climate change could lead to unexpected and rapid changes."Climate change is an extremely unpredictable series of events. And in the face of that, companies should be very prepared."

Climate changing as BlackRock rolls over
The Australian

When it came to pressing big companies to take action on climate change, the $US7 trillion ($10 trillion) BlackRock has been slow to come to the party.
The New York-based fund manager, which has two-thirds of its portfolio tied up in index-style passive funds, was also known in financial circles for taking a passive approach to engaging with the boards and management of the companies it invested in - particularly on issues like climate change.
A report released late last year by US advocacy group Majority Action slammed BlackRock and fellow passive investment giant Vanguard for "continuing to undermine global investor efforts to promote responsible climate action" in some of the world's largest companies.
It pointed out that when it came to voting for climate-related resolutions at annual meetings, BlackRock, the world's biggest fund manager, only supported 12 per cent of shareholder resolutions, one of the lowest by major global institutional investors. This was in stark contrast with active investors such as BNP Paribas Asset Management, Legg Mason, PIMCO, Standard Life Aberdeen, UBS Asset Management, DWS Group and Legal & General Investment Management.
The net effect of this, Majority Action said, was to "shield management from accountability, serving as a blockade for global investor action on climate".
As global pressure mounted, this week BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink did a public about-face with a more proactive approach to investor action on climate change, including engaging with boards in forums such as annual meetings.
"Climate change has become a defining factor in companies' long-term prospects ... but awareness is rapidly changing, and I believe we are on the edge of a fundamental reshaping of finance," Fink said in his annual letter to CEOs. "Investors are increasingly ... recognising that climate risk is investment risk.
"From Europe to Australia, South America to China, Florida to Oregon, investors are asking how they should modify their portfolios. They are seeking to understand both the physical risks associated with climate change as well as the ways that climate policy will impact prices, costs and demand across the entire economy." Mr Fink said that BlackRock had just joined the Climate 100+, an investor initiative backed by more than 370 investors, including many major Australian industry super funds, with total assets of more than $US35 trillion, to engage some of the world's largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to take action on climate change.
(There are 13 major Australian companies being engaged under this initiative, including AGL, Origin, BHP, Rio Tinto, Qantas and Woolworths.) The fund also announced plans to double its offering of sustainable exchange-traded funds from 75 to 150, including versions of its flagship index products.
The company said this would involve introducing new "fossil fuel screened funds" and "building new sustainable active strategies focussed on the global energy transition and impact investing".
It said it would take a more active approach to engaging with companies it invested in on climate change and would be "increasingly disposed to vote against management when companies have not made sufficient progress" in planning for a world that complied with the Paris Agreement goals.
Mr Fink said BlackRock's $US1.8 trillion actively managed investment portfolios would be selling their shares in thermal coal companies as part of rising investor concern about climate change and the fund would be prepared to take a more active role in voting on climate-change related resolutions at annual meetings.
While the stance has been widely hailed as a step in the right direction, critics have pointed out that this divestment decision only applies to the funds actively managed funds - 25 per cent of its total funds under management.
The plans to divest coal companies also exclude those which have less than 25 per cent of their revenues generated from coal, an exemption which allows it to retain its holding in BHP.
"BlackRock has been a laggard when it comes to climate change," John Hewson, chairman of the Business Council for Sustainable Development Australia, told The Australian.
"They have been slow to respond to action on climate change and now they are catching up." Dr Hewson said US opinion leaders such as former US Treasury secretary Hank Paulson were warning that climate change-induced financial risks could have a worse impact than the global financial crisis.
"Some big global funds have also moved towards more direct investment in renewable energy and low carbon investments.
"The pressure on people like BlackRock has been significant." "Now it is catching up." While most Australian super funds do not have a policy of divesting coal companies and large emitters, the large industry funds are actively working with companies to help them move to a lower carbon emission future.
Representatives of Australian super funds welcomed the BlackRock announcement. "It's encouraging to see Blackrock participate in Climate100+ and join other investors in ensuring the world's largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters take necessary action on climate change," Louise Davidson, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI), told the Australian.
"ACSI and our members have been engaging with companies on climate risks and opportunities for many years.
"Blackrock's decision to step up their voting policy on climate risk is in line with what our members expect of their asset managers." The $180bn industry fund -Australian Super has long been involved in working with companies on climate change issues.
It prefers active engagement with management on the transition to a low carbon future.
"AustralianSuper takes climate change into consideration with all investment decisions, especially given that climate change threatens the ability of long-term investors to generate value and meet their investment objectives over time," a spokesman said on Wednesday.
"AustralianSuper is a key institutional supporter of the Climate Action 100+ initiative.
"This has helped shape corporate priorities at some of the world's largest emitters.
"We put climate change at the centre of conversations on business strategy through our ongoing engagement with major corporations." While it is generally agreed that BlackRock is playing catch up, observers agreed that this week's announcements were significant, given the size of the fund and its role in global investor markets.
The chief executive of the $57bn construction industry super fund, David Atkin, said BlackRock's announcement reflected "the shifts occurring in global finance".
"There is significant private sector momentum towards sustainable finance, especially here in Australia," he said.
"We are likely to see more activity from large investors as the year progresses. "We welcome Blackrock to Climate 100+ and look forward to working together with them." Debbie Blakey, the chief executive of the $55bn hospitality industry super fund, HESTA, welcomed BlackRock as a new member of Climate Action 100+.
"This is targeting the 100 biggest corporate emitters of carbon which represent two thirds of global emissions," she said.
"It is very meaningful work." HESTA played an active role in working with oil company BP last year, along with several other major investors, including the Anglican Church, to get it to support a shareholder resolution requesting it set out its expansion plans in a way that complied with the Paris agreement emission targets.
"We engage very actively with the companies we invest in on climate change," she told the Australian.
"We are very thoughtful about how we do it.
"It's all very well to have a long-term goal (to reduce carbon emissions) but we want to get a clear view on the pathway the company intends to take to achieve it.
"We also want to see executive remuneration linked to achieving those targets." Like many other major industry funds, she said HESTA preferred the strategy of actively engaging with companies rather than selling out of their shares. "If we want to change the behaviour of companies in our portfolio, engagement is the most influential way we can do it." Ms Blakey said passive investment fund managers like BlackRock had "historically not tended to be as active in engagement (of the companies they invested in)".
"Our view is that ownership is always active, even if it is a passive investment," she said.
"BlackRock's announcement is an enormous market signal and some of the strongest evidence yet that global finance is shifting in response to the structural economic risk of climate change," Emma Herd, CEO of the Investor Group on Climate Change, told the Australian.
"Given BlackRock's sheer size and reach, its announcement ups the ante for Australian fund managers because it shows there is clear demand from asset owners for zero and low-carbon products.
"This will in turn increase competition among managers in our market." Ms Herd, who is also a member of the global steering committee of Climate Action 100+, said there were already "many Australian fund managers who have already progressively moved in terms of their market offerings, along with their broader engagement to secure company-level action to cut emissions across the value chain in line with the Paris Agreement, improve governance and raise transparency on climate-risk and opportunities".
"This is a significant step from the world's largest asset manager that will have a material impact on carbon-intensive companies that are not actively de-risking from climate change and transitioning their business strategies towards a net zero carbon future." She said major companies were "already on notice that institutional investors are demanding stronger action on climate-risk and decarbonisation".
"This will only accelerate that," she said.
She said BlackRock's shift would put pressure on other major passive investors "who have yet to step up".
Ms Herd said BlackRock's announcement came at a time when climate change was becoming a key issue in the finance industry debate in Australia.
"Regulators like ASIC, APRA and the Reserve Bank have already recognised that climate change is a systemic threat to our economy.
"They are now demanding finance companies treat their exposure to climate change as a "foreseeable, actionable and material risk" and have a plan to deal with it.
"This regulator interest, -coupled with community pressure and the growing physical risk of climate change, has meant there has been substantial momentum among Australian investors on -climate risk and decarbonisation."

Candidate sticks to guns over climate change

The conservative independent candidate favoured to win the Wagga Wagga by-election from the Liberal Party tomorrow has written articles about the dangers of climate change and supported organisations such as the Climate Council.
Joe McGirr yesterday conceded his views might differ from people voting for him but said he had to "stick to my guns".
In an article earlier this year that Dr McGirr co-wrote for The Australian Journal of Rural Health, he urged doctors to press governments on climate change.
"Addressing climate change has been described as the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century â€¦ Climate change -impacts health directly and indirectly," Dr McGirr said.
"The role of health services in providing education about the health impacts of climate change is well recognised." Dr McGirr yesterday defended his posts and comments: "I can't hide the fact that I have published on it in literature.
"That was one of my research interests and as far as the medical industry's concerned â€¦ it's about how we're going to die from it." Lancet literature had talked about people dying from heat--related illnesses, Dr McGirr said.
"I have said I think renewable energy is important and I have said that in a public forum," he said. "I accept that is not what conservative people want but that's my view of the situation. I have got to stick to my guns.
"As far as I'm aware, the Liberal Party has a policy that says -climate change is an issue." Liberal Party polling from earlier this week predicts a certain loss for the government, with Liberal candidate Julia Ham on 24 per cent of the primary vote, Labor's Dan Hayes on 24 and Dr McGirr on 22.
With Labor preferencing Dr McGirr, and the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party and Greens directing preferences to Labor, a government loss appears certain in the seat, with Dr McGirr the likely beneficiary.
ABC election analyst Antony Green said he believed Ms Ham would have to win at least 32 per cent of the primary vote to win the seat. "In the (2016) Orange (by-election), the Nationals got to 32 per cent and were run down by the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers," Mr Green said.
"To win in Wagga, they probably need the same sort of thing â€¦ to be in the early 30s because it will be very difficult for them to win (otherwise)." In budget estimates hearings yesterday, Premier Gladys Berejiklian appeared testy as she answered questions on Wagga Wagga and the departure of former Liberal MP Daryl Maguire over corruption allegations.
She denied she had been slow to take action against Mr -Maguire, who admitted to the Independent Commission Against Corruption that he had sought commissions from a Chinese developer but took more than two weeks after the allegations emerged to resign from parliament. "The day I came back from leave, he was gone from parliament," Ms Berejiklian said.She said it was clear there was distrust in politicians from the Wagga campaign and of the "obsession with ourselves rather than (working for) the community".

Labor to help farmers adjust to long-term climate change - ELECTION 2007

EVERY farmer who receives exceptional circumstances drought assistance will be offered a $5500 grant to assess their property and receive training to deal with ''climate change'' under a LaborParty plan.
The ALP wants to recast the Howard Government's help to drought-stricken farmers to make long-term plans to adjust to climate change.
Labor primary industry spokesman Kerry O'Brien will today tell the Queensland Rural Press Club that Labor's agriculture policy will be linked to tackling climate change.
''Labor believes it is important for government to increase the number of drought-ready farming businesses so that farms are more prepared for years with reduced rainfall in a climate change environment,'' he told The Australian.
He said the Howard Government had denied the reality of climate change and consequently failed to embrace the challenge facing Australia's rural producers.
Senator O'Brien said government programs did not oblige farmers to make changes to management strategies or to plan for the future but were focused on short-term income support and professional advice to families.
He will announce that a Rudd Labor government will provide $55million over three years to help farmers adjust to climate change, with money spent on financial assistance to obtain professional advice and training, and re-establishment grants.
Senator O'Brien will also announce that a Labor government will provide an additional $10million for the Rural Financial Counsellors Service: ''Federal Labor believes that farming in the future has to be about viability in a changing climate, with more frequent and harsher droughts.
''Future farms will require drought management plans and business plans that incorporate drought management strategies. Future farms will need to implement effective drought mitigation measures in order to survive.''
Senator O'Brien will declare that Labor will overhaul the policy settings for the FarmHelp Program to ''clearly link social policy outcomes with long-term climate change adjustment''.
''This means farmers receiving exceptional circumstances will receive assistance to evaluate their farm, seek advice and training and plan for the future to encourage improved adjustment outcomes consistent with longer periods of more intense drought.''
He will announce that a Rudd Labor government will also spend $15million over three years in a major new Climate Change and Productivity Research Program to assist farmers to respond to climate change.
These funds will be allocated to existing primary industry research and development corporations to develop and implement a climate change program for each major agricultural sector. Each corporation will have to publish a draft plan by September next year for implementation from 2009, and report annually on the link between public investment and research outcomes.
''A Rudd Labor government will work closely with farm leaders and the farming community to ensure there are positive incentives to increase the number of drought-ready farming businesses and over time, move toward better drought-proofing Australian agriculture in the context of a changing climate,'' Senator O'Brien will say.

CLIMATE CHANGE DOUBTERS ARE ENDANGERING OUR COMMON FUTURE

The risk runs all one way on the question of whether or not to act on global warming
THE battle against climate change in Europe is led from the Right. David Cameron, Conservative Prime Minister in Britain, President Nicolas Sarkozy in France, and Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany. All of them have bipartisan support from opposition centre-Left and Labour parties.
If there is an issue, it is not about the reality of global warming but the best way to tackle it. We are all signed up to cutting our emissions by 80 per cent by 2050, and we have to do between 25 per cent and 30 per cent by the end of this decade.
Most of us do accept the science that human action is changing our climate directly and that only by cutting emissions dramatically can we avert real disaster. Even those who aren't sure take the view that simple prudence dictates action. After all, none of us thinks our homes will be burnt down, but we do take out fire insurance. In fact the probabilities on climate change are far, far higher and the consequences of inaction almost unthinkable.
Like most people, I wish it were not so. Climate change is very inconvenient and that's perhaps why some, particularly in the US, present this or that partial argument to try to rubbish the science. If their theses stood up, I'd be the first to welcome it. However, I learned my trade in the hard school of Margaret Thatcher, who was the first major political figure to accept that climate change was happening and that mankind had caused it.
She was a scientist by training and she cross-questioned the experts in the way only she knew how. She would have preferred them to have been wrong too. However, the whole assembly of facts, even then, more than 20 years ago, convinced her that we had to act.
The science is now even more compelling but even if it weren't, most of what we have to do to fight climate change we will have to do anyway. With the world population reaching 9 billion by 2050 and more and more of its people living above subsistence level, we just have to learn to conserve our resources and do more with less. There are now more middle-class people in India than there are in Europe. In China, internal demand for goods and services is escalating at an enormous rate. I returned from a visit to Beijing at the end of last month. The next five-year plan will put sustainability and the battle against climate change at the heart of the nation's economic policy. They are now planning a climate change act that will draw on the experience of the West and seek to avoid our mistakes. What is not in doubt is their belief that climate change is happening and they have to act.
So it is not only the Europeans -- Right and Left -- who have taken up the challenge. From California to Korea, governments and civil society are finding their own ways to work towards a world that is not threatened by pollution. Even if they were all wrong and we acted, the result would be that we would have a cleaner planet, more able to cope with feeding, housing, and clothing those 9 billion people. If, however, we follow the sceptics and they turn out to be wrong, then we would leave our children a legacy of destruction. The risk is all one way, which explains why in Britain, scepticism is confined to the extremes. The political parties embracing it are way out on the edge of the spectrum with views on most other matters that few of us would embrace.
Of course, it is for every country to decide how best they can counter the threat. Australia will have to find its own way forward. What is vital is that politicians do not use climate change to promote other agendas. It is simply too important to use the issue to press other beliefs, whether on the Left or the Right. Instead you have to decide what is the most cost-effective way of reducing emissions and seeing how best to monitor its success. I can only give you the experience of others. You will have to judge how best to meet the challenge in a way that suits your country. In Britain we are using a mixture of measures. Under a Labour government, we pioneered a trading scheme that forms the basis of the European Trading Scheme. It wasn't perfect and we made mistakes to start with.
However, many of the problems are now overcome and we expect to make it even more effective at the revision next year. Apart from that, we have a mixture of incentives and tax. Labour introduced the carbon reduction commitment, which puts a tough levy on any company using more than the equivalent of $1 million of energy. The Conservative Coalition is introducing the Green Deal, which will provide incentives for domestic carbon reduction.
By placing an obligation on energy companies to promote renewable power, we support clean energy over fossil fuels.
The important fact is that there is a national consensus for all this. The system is overseen by the independent Climate Change Committee, which is composed of scientists, economists, and other experts, chaired by an eminent financier. Even though it has unprecedented powers and can call ministers to account, set carbon budgets and reduction targets, and even take the government to court, it was set up with only three MPs voting against. Of course there are opponents. Some respected figures, such as former chancellor Nigel Lawson in the House of Lords, put the case for ``wait and see''. Others outside, such as Christopher Monkton, are more lightweight and extreme and therefore largely discounted. Nonetheless they keep us all on our toes and ensure that we do things in the most cost-effective manner, measuring the outcomes and delivering the goods.
In the end, we all have to face the facts. The scientific consensus is now so significant that, even if we ourselves remain doubters, it would be wrong to endanger our children by hoping for the best. If we act sensibly there is real chance of success. The rest of the world is doing it, and I hope that Australia will join us in her own way and play her part in protecting our common future.

Media has a responsibility to publish independent analysis of climate change `consensus'

Coverage of climate change is the target of an increasing number of complaints made to the Australian Press Council. But scientists and activists are often seeking to silence those who challenge the prevailing `consensus'
SHOULD critics of renewable energy be allowed to voice their objections in the opinion pages of newspapers? Doesn't the protest against eco-taxes or the attack on wind and solar energy subsidies (and the redistribution of wealth from poor to rich that follows), contravene the media's core principle of ``accurate, fair and balanced reporting'', as green energy lobbyists complain?
And what about climate sceptics? Should they be permitted to express their doubts in the comments pages of newspapers? After all, probing the conventional wisdom about global warming has been branded as ``deliberately misleading'' by green campaigners who claim that any scepticism of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate consensus is violating the principle of the media's own code of conduct.
The former climate change adviser, Ross Garnaut, has lamented that balanced reporting of climate change has seriously undermined the drive for political action: ``If you take our mainstream media, it will often seek to provide some balance between people who base their views on the mainstream science and people who don't. That's a very strange sort of balance. It's a balance of words, and not a balance of scientific authority.''
A growing number of climate scientists and environmental campaigners are conducting an organised campaign against the principles of fair and balanced journalism that epitomise open and pluralistic societies.
Political activists are concerned that any doubts, uncertainties and objections expressed in the media may hinder drastic political action. No wonder, then, that campaigners are employing strategies to discourage or intimidate editors from inviting critics to explain their objections. Occasionally, a probing editor or columnist dares to challenge these forms of coercion despite the threats of protest and intimidation. In such cases, a whole army of campaigners and bloggers will rush to assail the insubordinate journalist.
Science based on ``consensus'' is a tricky business. I am agnostic about it because the history of science tells us that today's consensus can -- and quite frequently is -- tomorrow's redundant theory.
There are certain types of general agreements in science that are more compelling and more durable than others. In some areas of empirical science, such as solar system astronomy, there is more agreement because the data is more robust and the methods less complex. The more complex the science and the less reliable the data, the more scientific controversy you should expect to find. On the other hand we also know that science tends to produce -- and, in fact, needs -- scientific paradigms, which is perhaps a better word than consensus.
So I have really no problem with the fact that a majority of climate scientists believe they fully understand the main drivers of climate change.
But science would quickly come to a dead end without the constant and necessary attempts to scrutinise and falsify the leading paradigm of the day, particularly those that are weak and based on contentious data, dodgy methodologies and flawed computer models. Indeed, some critics argue that climate science has almost reached such a cul-de-sac.
The scientific endeavour involves both the protectors and challengers of each and every paradigm. Both are essential to the health and dynamic of a highly competitive enterprise that is science. No consensus is sacrosanct.
And it is in the very nature of fair and balanced journalism that all reasonable positions and counter-arguments should be heard.
While green campaigners are trying to frame even the energy and economic debates in the traditional fashion of a conflict between consensus and dissent, the political debate is no longer about action versus inaction.
The real issue today is about the most cost-effective ways of dealing with climate change: revolutionary transformation of the global economy, as advocated by climate alarmists, or gradual adaptation and adjustment to whatever nature may throw at us in the future, as proposed by environmental moderates.
Despite the majority view among climate scientists, science organisations and governments, there is a sizeable minority of researchers, economists and political observers who are concerned about the apocalyptic nature of climate hype and the growing risk this form of collective hysteria poses for political and economic stability. Sceptical researchers will continue to publish critical papers and critical columnists will publish comments that question the so-called climate consensus.
Should the mainstream media provide a platform for these critics? Should they discuss the weight of their evidence and the validity of their arguments? Or should the media simply ignore challenges to the status quo?
The integrity of Western media depends on whether they encourage critique and fault-finding analysis -- or whether they will drift more and more towards gullible campaign journalism.

IMMEDIATE THREATS SWAMPED BY FOCUS ON CLIMATE CHANGE
The Australian
August 1, 2020 Saturday, Australian Edition

Section: COMMENTARY; Pg. 20
Length: 935 words

Other global challenges such as nutrition, healthcare and jobs are being neglected
It wasn't that long ago when much of the global elite had decided conclusively that climate change was our world's top priority.
Then came a sideswiping by a pandemic, of which we have seen only the first wave, along with an equally enormous global recession. It serves as a timely reminder that an alarmism that cultivates one fear over others serves society poorly.
In the BC era - before coronavirus - the World Health Organisation famously called climate change the "greatest threat to global health in the 21st century".
Even as coronavirus tentacles were already spreading, the glitterati gathered at Davos in January and declared climate accounted for all the long-term biggest risks to the world.
The media happily recounted a steady stream of catastrophic climate scenarios. Campaigners found climate dystopias excellent for fundraising. Politicians in search of votes promised to save us from climate harm with ever-stricter emission regulations.
Not surprisingly, these persistent scare stories have convinced many that the climatic end of the world is nigh. One survey of 28 countries shows that almost half of all people believe climate change will likely lead to the extinction of the human race.
Global warming is a real challenge and a problem we need to tackle. But the alarmism makes it difficult for us to think smartly about climate solutions, and it swamps our attention away from the many other important global issues.
Even before COVID-19, this panic was vastly exaggerated. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change itself points out that if we try to measure all the negative impacts from climate change, it would be equivalent to reducing the average person's income in the 2070s by just 0.2 to 2 per cent. And this is from a base whereby the UN expects the average person in the 2070s to have an income 363 per cent higher than today's income.
So even the worst outcome of global warming will mean that we will be "only" 356 per cent richer than today. That is a problem but not the end of the world.
Take the very real problem of sea-level rise. This is often portrayed in near-apocalyptic terms. We recently have been treated to widespread reports that oceans could end up rising much more than what the IPCC tells us, displacing an astonishing 187 million people. Bloomberg News declared that coastal cities such as Miami might "drown in 80 years".
In reality, the 187 million number assumes that for the next 80 years nobody in the world will do anything to deal with the rising waters. In real life, of course, nations adapt. The study that gave the 187 million number also shows that with adaptation, the number of people who have to move by the end of the century is just 305,000. The number that made it around the world was exaggerated 600 times. For context, 305,000 people moving during the next 80 years is less than half the number of people who move out of California each year.
Moreover, the exclusive focus on climate change neglects that the world faces many other large challenges that we can engage in so much more effectively. Indeed, this is also what the vast majority of the world's poor tell us to focus on.
When the UN asked almost 10 million people what they regarded as the world's top priorities, the vast majority - especially from the world's poor - emphasised better education, healthcare, jobs, government and nutrition. Climate ranked 16th out of 16 priorities - right after phone and internet access.
There is an amazing array of effective solutions to many of the world's ills. Nutrition is one of the world's top priorities, and for good reason. Effective nutrition in the first two years of a child's life helps develop the brain, improves the educational impact and results in dramatically better-skilled adults. While nutrition costs only $US100 ($140) per child, it boosts the average child's lifetime income by $US4500 in today's money.
The same can be said for many health interventions. While we obviously need to continue to address the pandemic, let's remember that the world's leading infectious-disease killer is still tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is often overlooked, but it mostly kills adults in their prime and leaves children without parents.
Yet for only $US6bn a year the world could save nearly 1.6 million people from dying annually. When my think tank, the Copenhagen Consensus, provided an analysis for philanthropist Bill Gates, he called the money he devoted to such disease prevention the "best investment I've ever made".
Of course, we still need to address climate. Research shows that the most effective way is to dramatically increase investment in green research and development. This could reduce the price of green energy below the costs of fossil fuels and make everyone switch. Because this would also be much cheaper than our ineffective policies that cost us hundreds of billions of dollars each year in subsidies for the current generation of ineffective renewables and in lost economic growth from more expensive energy, our budgets would be able to tackle a much wider range of the top issues.
When false climate alarm makes us insist on invoking climate at every turn, we end up helping the world only a little at very high cost.
We can - and must - do more, better and faster. Bjorn Lomborg is president of the Copenhagen Consensus and a visiting fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University.

ADF urged to be ready for climate change role

THE Australian Defence Force must pay much more attention to a future role dealing with the impact of climate change at home and in the region, a key think tank has warned.
A report by the Australian Strategy Policy Institute argues that Defence will be forced to respond to the disruptive effects of climate change and needs a new approach. It says that at home and in the region the ADF will have to help deal with rising temperatures, extreme events such as cyclones of greater intensity, more frequent floods, rising sea levels, heatwaves, changing drought and fire risk along with shifting disease patterns.
``Climate change will exacerbate existing hardships and stresses in our neighbourhood, possibly risking the reaching of critical tipping points,'' it says.
Defence might have to help deal with populations being forced out of their home areas and increased conflict over resources as changes in climate patterns reduced crop yields and threatened food security. Failure to anticipate these changes and understand their cascading security implications could increase the threat of states failing.
The report's authors, veteran climate scientist Anthony Press, ASPI deputy director Anthony Bergin and researcher Eliza Garnsey, say the ADF needs to work with the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Climate Change to work out how to deal with climate change scenarios for Australia and the Asia-Pacific and to manage the risks to regional stability.
Their report says that because of the growing importance of climate change to the nation's broad security interests, the ADF should consider much more comprehensively the implications of climate change and develop strategies to help deal with them.
The authors note that the 2009 defence white paper dismissed climate change as an issue for future generations, judging that the strategic consequences would not be felt before 2030. ``But that's no longer the case,'' the report says.

Climate change policy made on the run: Hunt

THE opposition has accused Labor of making climate change policy on the run and failing to even set up 22 per cent of the environmental schemes it has announced.
In a speech to be delivered tonight at the Mt Eliza Business School in Melbourne, the Coalition's environment spokesman, Greg Hunt, will escalate his attack on Labor's handling of the climate change portfolio since 2007, accusing both the Rudd and Gillard governments of ``constantly chopping and changing on climate change policy''.
But a spokesman for Climate Change Minister Greg Combet last night accused the Coalition of indulging in ``mindless negativity and over-the-top scare campaigns''.
Mr Hunt has analysed 37 climate change programs -- including the carbon tax, the home insulation program, the green car innovation fund, cash for clunkers and the citizens' assembly -- and says eight of the schemes were never even established.
A further 14 programs had been scrapped early, replaced, reduced or frozen, and Mr Hunt said 40 per cent of the programs ``failed to deliver on stated objectives''.
``We have already seen eight major changes to the carbon tax package in the first 100 days, including the scrapping of the $2 billion contract for closure program,'' Mr Hunt says in a draft of the speech provided to The Australian.
``This chop and change is not confined to the carbon tax, it is endemic throughout the climate change portfolio area. There are at least eight programs that were announced with great fanfare and they were scrapped before they even started,'' he says.
Mr Combet's office last night defended the Gillard government's track record on climate change, declaring real achievements had been delivered and households and businesses had been supported to improve energy efficiency.
``The carbon price has been legislated and introduced smoothly and will reduce Australia's carbon pollution with none of the dire consequences predicted by Tony Abbott,'' the spokesman said. ``Our programs have also helped hundreds of thousands of households to install solar panels and solar hot water systems, cutting their energy costs and helping the environment.''
But Mr Hunt said 22 schemes had had funding diverted to other initiatives, such as the Queensland flood recovery, and accused Labor of using its $652.5 million renewable energy future fund to fund election commitments including the Climate Change Commission and the emerging renewables program.

Libs facing election rout - CLIMATE CHANGE SCEPTICS WOULD DRIVE AWAY VOTERS IN KEY SEATS

THE Coalition faces an electoral wipeout at next year's federal election if the rebels led by Tony Abbott and Nick Minchin succeed in blocking the government's climate change legislation.
The Coalition could lose at least 20 of its metropolitan seats, including those of its leader, Malcolm Turnbull, Treasury spokesman Joe Hockey and climate change critics Kevin Andrews and Andrew Robb, according to an analysis of Newspoll results.
Mr Turnbull faces a leadership spill at a partyroom meeting called for 9am on Tuesday.
Mr Abbott is considered to be the frontrunner in any challenge, but there is also strong support for Treasury spokesman Joe Hockey.
Mr Hockey has said he will contest the leadership only if it is vacated by Mr Turnbull, who was digging in last night, saying he would remain Liberal leader until the party removed him.
Mr Turnbull believes that abandoning support for the compromise Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme would be fatal for the Coalition's electoral prospects.
According to the Newspoll analysis, support for the government's emissions trading scheme legislation is overwhelming among Coalition voters in metropolitan areas. Newspoll shows that 63 per cent of Coalition voters in the cities believe the government's bill should be passed, while only 28 per cent think it should be opposed.
If one in 10 of those voters changed sides because of a Coalition decision to block action on climate change, it would cost the Liberal Party the 20 metropolitan seats that it holds with margins of less than 6.5 per cent.
These findings are consistent with the Liberal Party's internal research in marginal seats, which shows that between 75 and 80 per cent of swinging voters favour action on climate change.
Senior party officials say the research shows a triumph by climate change sceptics would be ``the death of the party''.
Newspoll chief executive Martin O'Shannessy says the most worrying finding for the Coalition is that its voters aged 18 to 34 favour the government's legislation by a margin of almost five to one. The Newspoll survey, taken in mid-September, showed that 75 per cent of Coalition voters in this age group backed the bill, while only 17 per cent were opposed.
``It was a tremendous swing in that age group that put most of the energy behind the swing to Labor in 2007,'' Mr O'Shannessy said, noting that the same age group had also been important in the success of former prime minister John Howard.
``These people aren't rusted on to the Coalition, even though they say they're Coalition voters. They are clearly at risk.''
The Newspoll analysis shows that Coalition seats are not safe in rural areas either. A clear, though much smaller, majority is also in favour of the government's bill.
In rural seats, Newspoll found that 41 per cent of Coalition voters were opposed to the government's emissions trading scheme bill while 50 per cent were in favour.
Whatever the Coalition does will lose votes in rural seats, but
Continued on Page 6
Continued from Page 1
opposition to the climate change legislation would lose it more.
The Liberal Party's own research shows the strongest opposition to the government's bill is in the bedrock 35 per cent of the electorate that is its core support.
Many of these conservative voters share Senator Minchin's belief that there is no human-induced change to climate.
These are the voters who have been inundating MPs' offices with emails and phone calls, urging them to block the legislation.
However, the party's analysis of voters who supported the Coalition in 2007 but previously voted Labor, and former Coalition supporters who voted for a change of government at the last election, shows they massively favour action on climate change.
Election analyst Malcolm Mackerras said the Newspoll analysis is consistent with his own research, suggesting the Coalition would lose up to 20 seats, taking Labor's majority from 26 to more than 40 seats.
Mr Mackerras said he believed high-profile Liberals such as Mr Hockey, Mr Andrews and Mr Robb had enough local support to retain their seats.
However, if Mr Turnbull vacated his eastern Sydney seat of Wentworth at the next election, it would fall to Labor.
Mr Mackerras said the leadership infighting would cost the Coalition severely. ``The instability is a greater reason for them losing votes than their climate change position, but both are bad losers.''
Labor had passed up an opportunity by deciding not to contest the December 5 by-election in the Melbourne seat of Higgins, being vacated by former treasurer Peter Costello, Mr Mackeras said.

Flannery pledges to take climate change debate out of town

ENVIRONMENTAL activist Tim Flannery has pledged to take the climate change message to the regions after being appointed to head Julia Gillard's Climate Commission in a three-day-a-week role that will pay $180,000 a year.
The appointment of the 2007 Australian of the Year to the commission -- promised by the Prime Minister during the election campaign last year -- came as opposition climate action spokesman Greg Hunt said the organisation was there to explain the government's policy to ``push up power prices'' and added to the government's wasteful spending.
But Climate Change Minister Greg Combet said the commission would enable people to get information about climate change, climate science, international developments and the actions other countries were taking to deal with climate change.
The commission's work will add to the material being published by the government's climate change advisor Ross Garnaut and comes as the multi-party commission is considering a mechanism to price carbon.
Professor Flannery said the commission would lead a discussion ranging from climate change adaptation through to a carbon price.
He declined to be drawn on policy but said ``no one is underplaying the size'' of the challenge to cut emissions.
He also cited a recent Climate Institute paper that suggested China had a shadow carbon price of $8.50 a tonne of CO2 while Australia's was in the range of $2.50 a tonne.
Professor Flannery said he would continue with his other jobs, including serving on the Siemens Sustainability Advisory Board, and on the Prince of Monaco's Foundation, as well as his role at Macquarie University.
Professor Flannery has been an at-times controversial figure, arguing that firestick farming by Aborigines reshaped the nation's ecology, but he has been a long-time advocate of tackling climate change by limiting emissions.
Professor Flannery said the commission faced ``a big job . . . to just get a broader understanding in the community of the options that are before us''.

CUT & PASTE Plus an old bore indulged and German efficiency isn't all it's cracked up to be
Jack Waterford in The Canberra Times opinion pages on how that evil Tony Abbott misused and abused ASIO, June 26: ASIO once gloried in being a purely advisory body without any executive functions. It was restricted by law on what it could confide to politicians or anyone else. Now ASIO seems to see itself as a player not only in detecting threats to security, but in active measures to bring them down. It wants to play advocate as much as analyst and to play the policeman ... Decent politicians show restraint about use of public servants for overtly political purposes. Especially on national security matters. The armed services, security officials and the forces of law and order simply cannot perform their functions without popular assent. That will not last if there are perceptions of their being politically partisan, mere tools of the government of the day.
And Waterford on Malcolm Turnbull's recent use of the ASIO boss? Nothing.
But Paris has solved everything. The Canberra Times, yesterday: A leading think tank and lobby group on climate change is fighting for its survival after the multimillion-dollar support of its primary benefactor ran out. The Climate Institute, which has become one of Australia's most prominent environment ... groups since being set up through a bequest in 2005, suffered a 62 per cent fall in revenue last financial year â€¦ Chief executive John Connor said the situation facing the organisation ... was "extremely challenging", and could lead to its closure after 2016-17 unless it found ... at least $1.5 million.
Fairfax finally starts to catch up with The Australian. Charles Waterstreet, The Sun-Herald, yesterday: ICAC has lost much of its swagger and the smell, more and more, resembles I KAK.
Old bore tells old stories. Alan Ramsey, The Sydney Morning Herald, Saturday: Paul Keating could well have woken with a smile today and Bob Hawke with a snarl ... December 19, 1991 ... The day Bob Hawke's federal ALP colleagues voted him out of office ... It was, it must be obvious, a wondrous time to be writing about politics.
Would you believe that the article cites nothing to support this headline? The Guardian, Saturday: Of course "socialism" was most-searched term of 2015: its ideas fit our times.
Super thorough. The Economist, October 24: When Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, made her case in August that the country could manage its record inflow of refugees, she added ... "German thoroughness is super." Mostly. The Wall Street Journal, Thursday: German police on Thursday arrested a Syrian refugee suspected of links to Islamic State, a German prosecutor said, highlighting the potential security risks posed by Berlin's open-door refugee policy â€¦ For much of this year, overwhelmed German authorities stopped holding individual hearings for Syrians in a bid to speed up their asylum applications.

Caution on tying heat to climate change

AUSTRALIA can expect more heatwaves and bushfires in the decades ahead but scientists caution against blaming this year's record temperatures and devastating blazes on climate change.
Several leading climate scientists at an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change meeting in Hobart yesterday warned that heatwaves might become six times more frequent in Australia within 30 years. However, they also said this summer's bushfire disasters and record temperatures across many states could not be judged to be a result of climate change.
``You need to look over longer periods of time and take into account variations over a longer period of time to make a careful assessment,'' said Scott Power, Bureau of Meteorology senior principal research scientist.
``But it's clear that these sorts of things do become more common under climate change and it's clear that Australia has warmed up, the world has warmed up, coastal sea levels have warmed up, global sea levels have warmed up.''
There has been debate about whether the events of recent months, with record temperatures across eastern and southern states and catastrophic bushfires, are part of a changing climate.
On Monday, Greens leader Christine Milne referred to the recent bushfires as evidence of climate change and a ``wake-up call'' to the major parties to abandon coal and coal-seam gas. ``You only have to look at what's happening with the fires around the country and the extreme heatwaves . . . to see what impact climate change is already having.''
However, Dr Power, an IPCC lead author on near-term climate change, cautioned against attributing any one season, or even a succession of unusual years, to global warming. ``Extreme temperatures, heatwaves, bushfires -- it's all part and parcel of living in Australia during summer, so that's nothing new,'' Dr Power said. ``What climate change does is increase the likelihood of such events and also increases the intensity.
``So far in Australia we have seen warming of about 0.9C since 1910 and that's projected to go up . . . if emissions aren't brought down over coming decades,'' Dr Power said.
``So these sorts of events will become increasingly more common and the temperature records that are set will tend to go up with each passing decade.''

THE economic impact of climate change cannot be ignored, Kevin Rudd said yesterday, as he dismissed suggestions the global economic crisis could derail efforts to reduce carbon emissions.
``Climate change is there with a huge impending economic cost for us all,'' the Prime Minister said before the release of Ross Garnaut's final report. ``We'll stage our implementation of Australia's response to climate change in an economically responsible way.''
Climate Change Minister Penny Wong said the Government would consider Treasury modelling on an emissions trading scheme ``very carefully'' as it progressed with its policy.
``We on this Government recognise absolutely the scale and significance of the global financial crisis,'' she said.
``We are very conscious of the need to progress our response to climate change in an economically responsible way. We will take a balanced response.''
Senator Wong said the review showed ``the costs of taking action to reduce carbon pollution are less than the costs that would be incurred if we fail to act''.
The Opposition has accused the Government of pursuing a 2010 start date for emissions trading without knowing the impact of the global financial meltdown.
``Professor Garnaut is saying that Australia by itself can make no impact on global climate change, that climate change is a global problem requiring a global solution,'' Opposition spokesman on emissions trading design Andrew Robb said. He accused the Government of rushing the finalisation of an emissions trading scheme ``for purely political reasons''.
Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Peter Anderson said Professor Garnaut's work had ``two critical missing links -- the absence of robust economic modelling and the absence of global emissions trading agreements''.
``In the current environment of global market instabilility, business cautions that only a measured approach, tailored to international development and with appropriate compensation arrangements, would be in the national interest.''
Mr Anderson warned about the impact of an emissions trading scheme on small business, given Professor Garnaut's foreshadowed increase in energy costs and other inputs.
The National Association of Forest Industries welcomed Professor Garnaut's final report. Chief executive Allan Hansard said the document showed Australia's forests would help the nation meet as much as one-quarter of the total carbon emission reduction targets.
Greens leader Bob Brown said the review showed ``responsible climate change action'', a target of 450 parts per million of carbon dioxide equivalents in the earth's atmosphere, ``will see Australia's wealth increase by the same amount in 2020 as if weak targets (550ppm) are adopted -- only eight months later''.
Senator Brown rejected the 550 parts per million option as ``timid''. ``The Garnaut option of 550 ppm will see the loss of the Great Barrier Reef, Kakadu and Ningaloo Reef, as well as the Australian Alps, and lead to 10m sea level rises,'' he said. ``That's unthinkable.''
His remarks were echoed by Australian Conservation Foundation climate change program manager Tony Mohr, who urged the Government not to accept the ``second best option of 550ppm''.
Mr Mohr described support for a 10 per cent cut in emissions as ``a decision to support the devastation of our natural icons''.

Middle class still not sold on climate change

``I CAN'T for the life of me see why we should be paying for something that won't make a jot of difference.
``India, China, Brazil, Indonesia. They won't contribute. So we go first. I just can't see why.''
Small businessman Peter Verey owns a children's shoe store in Ringwood, an outer eastern Melbourne suburb in the middle of the federal seat of Deakin, which was pinched by Labor at last year's poll after 23 years in Coalition hands. The margin is small, just 1.4 per cent.
At 66, Verey has owned the business for 33 years, taking over from his father, who opened the store in 1954. Each January, through oil shocks, economic booms and recessions we had to have, children have been dragged in from the holidays for black school shoes to start the year. They sit on the train in the middle of the store to be fitted.
``I don't quite understand how it's all supposed to work, this reduction target and the trading system. I am worried it will put a cost on things that will flow right through my business -- power, materials,'' he says.
A day speaking to Verey and others in the shops, streets and malls of Deakin reveals a great deal about Kevin Rudd's chances of selling his climate change policy beyond the younger cohort and into middle Australia.
It quickly becomes clear people pick up on the simple messages but switch off when they hear politicians and experts using acronyms and assuming knowledge. Most -- not all -- accept human activity is changing the climate. And most see it as the Government's role to find a way forward. They accept the need for action, but how much financial pain they are prepared to bear is the political judgment Rudd is banking on getting right.
Seats like Deakin are on a knife edge. And some worry about Rudd being forced to deal with the Greens, whose climate policies they feel are too extreme.
Another recurring theme is the concern that by committing Australia to reduction targets now, we are out on a limb, acting when other countries aren't. That simple message has gained much traction in an issue overloaded with complexity.
Jillian Wright and her daughter Libby are typical of the shoppers rushing around with Christmas lists crumpled in their hands. They have popped into Neco in the neighbouring suburb of Blackburn looking for gift ideas. Neco, open just 10 days, offers environmentally friendly stock from rain tanks to shower heads to light globes.
Wright, 54, says the green message has well and truly hit home in their household. ``We turn off the lights now when we might have left them on before. We are careful about water and are considering a rain tank. We've got a timer for the shower. We've changed all our light bulbs over,'' she says. But like about 85per cent of the households in Victoria, her household hasn't switched to green power.
``I'm not convinced it will make a difference, and I get cross with people ringing me all the time asking me to change electricity providers to take it up.''
And while she's happy Rudd ratified the Kyoto Protocol on climate change earlier in the year, she says she worries ``it might just be a propaganda exercise''.
``China, Russia, India, they haven't made any commitment. We're just a drop in the ocean compared to them. I also don't think you get the whole story on global warming. You only get the front cover,'' she says.
``For instance, the biggest carbon emission item in a house is the hot water, but no one seems to talk very much about that.''
Further along the road at Coles the queues are long. Watching for a while, it's apparent how strongly the recycling message has resonated across the demographic spectrum. A brief count puts the green bag/plastic bag ratio at about 60/40, with older women the most consistent users. Simple message: plastic bags last forever and choke dolphins. Simple solution. Strong response. If only climate change was so black and white.
Health sector auditor Kerry Duckworth, 33, and her mother Neri Norman, 66, plonk down at a food court table outside Coles so Duckworth can feed her baby.
Duckworth says environmental issues have been important to her for a long time. ``My flatmates used to call me the recycling Nazi,'' she says. She knows the Government has set a 5 per cent carbon reduction target for 2020 regardless of action by other countries, and says it's a worthy aspiration, and certainly not too soft.
``I do struggle with the idea of why we should be doing something that other countries aren't doing,'' she says.
``And I'm concerned about how it will happen. Will we really all work smarter, or will our small businesses bear the brunt?''
Her mother is less convinced about the existence of global warming. ``You hear all these contradictory opinions,'' Norman says. ``I don't think we have the whole story on climate change. I don't think the science is fully explained. And global warming and climate change, they're different things anyway,'' she says.
Caravan industry consultant Barry Yule is having a coffee in the monolithic Eastlands complex before finishing his Christmas shopping.
The 62-year-old says the issue of climate change does concern him, more so since his three grandchildren came along.
But he worries Rudd's formula even at a 5 per cent reduction, will hurt the country. And again he questions Australia putting itself out there before others commit to a global solution.
``I certainly think Rudd is being a bit idealistic about climate change. He seems to be pitching his policies at attracting young voters,'' Yule says.
``And I worry about Labor maybe dealing with the Greens on this issue. The Greens really worry me and I think they might step back a little from what they want to deal with Rudd. And that could really hurt our small and medium businesses.''

Climate change and dryness 'fuelled fires'

A highly anticipated inquiry report into the Black Summer bushfires has concluded that cata-strophic conditions were caused in large part by climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, but factors such as dry fuel loads were also significant in contributing to the infernos.
The independent review, commissioned in January while the fires still burned across the state, was released after cabinet endorsed all 76 recommendations.
The impact of the fires was felt across the country, but particularly in NSW where 26 people died and 2476 homes were destroyed. Those who perished included firefighters, and the report singled out "varying standards" of protection afforded by their trucks, masks and other personal protective equipment.
Mental health and well-being matters also featured prominently in the inquiry report, as did hazard reduction burning, which are set to be conducted closer to homes and at-risk communities.
Further research into climate patterns, technological innovation and the use of grazing in nat-ional parks also formed part of the recommendations and findings.
Led by former NSW police deputy commissioner Dave Owens and former chief scientist Mary O'Kane, the inquiry distilled the fires' causes to a range of prominent factors. Among these were the extreme dryness of some forested regions, the over-stretched resources of the NSW Rural Fire Service, and the inability of firefighters to reach -ignition sources quickly enough in some remote locations.
Climate change was also singled out early in the report, which runs to more than 400 pages.
"It is clear we should expect fire seasons like 2019-20 or potentially worse, to happen again," the report noted. "Climate change as a result of increased greenhouse gas emissions clearly played a role in conditions that led up to the fires and in the unrelenting conditions that supported the fires to spread, but climate change does not explain everything that happened." While NSW, like the rest of the country, is technically in winter, the fire season has begun for 2020. Several local government areas are on alert, and funding measures have been brought forward to mobilise hazard reduction efforts.
"We are prepared for the next season. What we're not prepared for, of course, is the unknown," said NSW Emergency Services Minister David Elliott.
Other strategies recommended include compulsory land clearing measures, night-time water bombing of fires and the trial use of water-bombing aircraft as a first response for fire suppression, to reduce the intensity of the blazes. The report argues strongly for innovative solutions, such as unmanned aircraft and vehicles, as a measure to save more lives.

MCA changes its tune on climate change

Australia's peak mining industry body has joined the fight on climate. The Minerals Council of Australia won't ditch coal but it has yielded to pressure from lobby groups that have stormed the world's boardrooms and fin-ancial markets pushing for a shareholder revolt on fossil fuels.
They have forced the MCA to be outspoken in its support for cutting carbon dioxide emissions.
At the height of a campaign against it by climate groups, the MCA risked losing some of its biggest members, including miners like Rio Tinto and BHP.
In the end, council chief executive Brendan Pearson had to go. The MCA's new CEO, Tania Constable, has spent the past two years negotiating a climate change action plan for the industry group that includes Australia's top 10 coal producers. The plan backs the federal government's approach for technology-led sol-utions. It sets an aspiration for the industry to become carbon--neutral but unlike the Business Council, puts no timetable on when this should be achieved.
Ms Constable rejects it is an exercise in greenwashing to provide cover for MCA members, but it remains to be seen whether the plan will wash with green -lobbyists.
The MCA was listed by a UK-based group as one of the top 10 global associations blocking -action on climate change.
Ms Constable said the tag was based on old assumptions but as financial markets and corporate reputations become a new frontline in pressure for climate action, the MCA was keen to show it cared. "There certainly has been a political activism pressure applied to investors to leave the council but the Minerals Council hasn't been the only council they cited," she said.
"It (the climate plan) is not something we developed because activists put pressure on investors. It has always been part of our plan because it makes good business sense. "Senior executives have alway regarded pragmatic and effective climate change measures as an economic opportunity for them," Ms Constable said.
She said the MCA had always accepted the science of climate change but was now "taking practical action to make sure we are decarbonising our industry over time".
"We support the Paris Agreement and part of that is making sure we are decarbonising as quickly as we can," she said.
The failure to nominate a date for the industry to become -carbon-neutral reflects a diversity of opinion among MCA members and international groups.
The Paris Agreement as it stands calls for carbon neutrality in the second half of this century.
Momentum is building for this to be changed to 2050, a date already adopted by some countries.
Some of the world's biggest companies plan to be carbon-neutral by 2040. Ms Constable said MCA members could set whatever date was appropriate for them. Minerals Council member are responsible for 80 per cent of Australia's mining output. They include the 10 biggest coal companies as well as base metals, zinc, copper, lead, gold, new -metals and minerals such as lithium, rare earths and minerals sands. "If you think what might be on a periodic table in terms of minerals, they all sit within our membership," Ms Constable said.
The climate action plan does not mean it is ditching support for coal. "We support coalmining," she said. "We have strong (coal) exports, particularly into the Asian region. We have 50,000 -direct employees on the east coast in coal and hundreds of thousands of indirect jobs that benefit from the coal industry." The Minerals Council said it supported technologies that helped the coal industry reduce emissions. It said technologies existed today to reduce emissions from the production and combustion of coal. "With carbon capture and storage coupled with offsets and international abatement units, it is possible for the coal industry to get to zero emissions," Ms Constable said. The MCA believes there is a case for some of Australia's coal assets to be upgraded, including the addition of carbon capture and storage.

CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY HAS TRIPPED US UP FOR A DECADE
The Australian

Rudd brought himself undone on this, but it has vexed Australian politics ever since The Labor-driven media coverage recognising this week as the 10th anniversary of the dramatic defeat of Kevin Rudd's climate change policy is a bizarre mixture of truth and mythology revealing, a decade later, the extent of Australia's deadlock on global warming action.
What you haven't read was the headline story. The prime responsibility for this failure lay with Rudd as prime minister, who had control of the policy, timing and politics. Rudd enjoyed a huge polling advantage, often running at 57-43 per cent in two-party-preferred terms and, incredibly, an opposition leader in Malcolm Turnbull who wanted to pass the legislation. Such assets were -torched in one of the most abject political failures for decades.
The Labor Party's bashing of the Greens over the past week for their shameful vote on December 2, 2009, is completely justified but misses the bigger point. For a decade Labor has embraced climate change action as a core -element of its identity, yet has singularly failed to carry the Australian public when it counted. It has paid a fearful price.
Labor's past three leaders - Rudd, Julia Gillard and Bill Shorten - have been destroyed with climate change policy critical in the demise of each. The paradox of Labor's position is its entrenched belief that the people want decisive climate change action, yet its -repeated failure to translate this belief into a policy endorsed at the ballot box.
This has been a failure of strategy and tactics. The Labor mantra, displayed again this week, is to blame the Greens, then the Tony Abbott-led Coalition, then the Scott Morrison-led Coalition, for defeating what is Labor's non-negotiable commitment to climate change action. This raises the question: if the public is so enthusiastic, why does Labor keep losing?
Over the decade it has lost in the parliament and lost in the country. The reason is because this issue is unique: environmental mythology obscures political -reality. Public support for climate change action fluctuates according to cycle and circumstance. Labor has struggled to find and hold the middle ground on this issue. The moral superiority of the climate change lobby and its compulsion to brand as "deniers" anybody who merely backs moderate emissions reduction targets alienates many Australians.
The serial ALP failures almost defy belief - in 2009 the Senate voted 41-33 against Rudd's policy; in 2010 Rudd refused to confront Abbott with an election on climate change policy; a few months later he retreated from that climate policy; in 2010 Gillard, in a political -reversal to save her government, entered an alliance with the Greens to legislate an emissions trading scheme; in 2013 Labor lost an election off the back of Gillard's so-called carbon tax, leading to Abbott's repeal of the ETS; and in 2019 Shorten lost an election after running hard on radical climate change action, rejecting any need to document the cost of his policy.
The fatal political structures -established in 2009 have endured for a decade. Rudd failed in 2009 because he failed to hold the -middle ground against both the Greens and Coalition on opposite sides. The same fate befell Shorten 10 years later.
The dilemma for Labor is that Rudd's fate shows it fails when the Greens are the enemy but Gillard's fate shows it fails when the Greens are the -allies.
In 2009 Rudd and his climate change minister, Penny Wong, took their pivotal decision early in the debate - Turnbull, not the Greens, would be their legislative partner. "I had come to the view pretty early on the Greens were going to oppose whatever we did," Wong said. "They wanted a fundamental differentiation." Rudd and Wong were correct. The tactic from the Greens was to punish Labor on climate change and oppose Rudd's carbon pollution reduction scheme. This is their DNA; it goes to their existence. They pitch as the only party of true climate change. The typical destructive business model of the Greens was seen a few weeks ago in their false claim that the Morrison government and its climate change policy was responsible for bushfires.
Turnbull made clear his game plan: he wanted to vote for Rudd's scheme, neutralise climate change via bipartisanship and run against Labor on economic policy at the 2010 election. Julie Bishop and Joe Hockey agreed. Turnbull needed to win concessions from Rudd on the scheme to appease his own side and Labor did offer hefty concessions.
But Rudd never treated Turnbull as his legislative partner. He did the opposite: he attacked Turnbull, depicted the Coalition as sceptics "holding the world to ransom", accused Turnbull of "political cowardice" and branded him a risk to "our jobs, our houses, our farms, our reef, our economy and our future".
Rudd declined to negotiate -directly with Turnbull. He was greedy. He wanted Turnbull's support for his policy but he wanted to destroy the Turnbull Coalition as immoral and weak on climate change. These were contradictory goals. For passing Labor's policy, Rudd offered Turnbull nothing but truckloads of humiliation.
Gillard saw this was nonsense. "We should have thrown our arms around Turnbull," she said. Mark Arbib made the same point: clever Kevin wedged Brendan Nelson and Turnbull on a carbon price, but lost his own policy. Rudd's -former press secretary, Sean Kelly said: "We missed the main game - the passage of our scheme, not further discrediting Turnbull." Bishop sampled party opinion and reported back: resistance to "caving into Rudd" was mounting. Rudd needed Turnbull but was undermining Turnbull. It made no sense.
The revolt in the Coalition against Turnbull was a "bottom-up" process. The key figure was Senate leader Nick Minchin, who nailed the politics: he said Rudd's emissions trading scheme would have zero impact on the global climate (given our emissions were only 1.5 per cent of the world) but would damage our competitive position and boost power bills. These were powerful arguments, pretty similar to Morrison's arguments a decade later.
After the revolt against Turnbull in the partyroom on November 24, 2009 - when Andrew Robb's speech against Turnbull was decisive but Turnbull declared a majority for his position - Minchin defied Turnbull, decided to vote against Rudd's scheme and quit as Senate leader. Abbott followed Minchin.
Abbott was elected leader 42-41 over Turnbull and the partyroom voted in a secret ballot 54-29 to -reject convincingly an ETS policy. Abbott's ascension was driven by policy - it was to turn the Liberals into an anti-carbon pricing party and convert the climate question into a price, not a moral, issue. This was a bridge too far. But it worked brilliantly for several years, culminating in Abbott's 2013 election victory and the -repeal of Labor's policy.
The reality, however, is that the 2009 schism within the Liberals was never really resolved. It -remained, often concealed, only to reappear with lethal import after Turnbull returned as leader in late 2015. A series of Turnbull government-proposed climate change policy mechanisms was vetoed by the Abbott-led conservatives staying loyal to their 2009 spirit and their 2013 election success.
In the end Turnbull's effort to promote the national energy guarantee was present at his demise in a way that invited disturbing parallels with the 2009 crisis that terminated his initial leadership. The upshot is that Morrison, in office, has had to improvise in spinning a new policy and avoid igniting the still burning embers of the 2009 political divide.
In summary, the Labor-Green split still exists. Labor lacks the electoral base to prevail on climate policy whenever the Greens and Coalition both resist it - hence Wong's recent remark on Labor's need to build more common ground. And the Coalition side -remains fractured on climate policy because of the competing interests and values of its diverse constituency, the spark that ignited the 2009 political fire.Policy has been sacrificed because of these complex political forces. The underlying story is that finding a settled polity is hard in Australia because it must reconcile the progressive high--income climate-change city voters with the nation's profile as a coal and gas superpower reinforced by this cultural ethos in the regions and outer suburbs.

Building code not ready for climate change

Australia's building design rules need a major overhaul to help future-proof homes and buildings for climate change.
The national president of the Australian Institute of Architects, Richard Kirk, said regulations did not allow for the types of innovation needed to mitigate the anticipated climate shift.
"The most important issue facing Australia is getting authorities to appreciate the very short time frame in which our climate will change," Mr Kirk said.
"It's very real, and it's very tangible and we need to make sure the community as a whole is developing housing stock for climate change. It's not about red tape, it's about education and getting people prepared for the dramatic change in climate." He said as well as a doubling of insulation, regulators needed to consider innovations like "precinct cooling systems" through cities.
"To build a house now that's not anticipating a shift in temperature is crazy," said Mr Kirk.
"The great thing about regulation is it's a way of getting a critical mass so when you go to market the actual cost doesn't shift dramatically." Other changes Mr Kirk would like to see ingrained in the building code related to sustainability and energy generation.
"The Paris Accord seeks to have every new building carbon-neutral," Mr Kirk said. "One of the great initiatives we've been undertaking with our work is to try to open buildings up. All buildings should be able to be opened so you can use natural ventilation. It's not only more efficient, it's healthier." His views were shared by Brisbane-based residential architect Shaun Lockyer, who said regulations were not in step with modern, sustainable design.
"A lot of legislation tries to prevent the worst thing happening rather than encouraging the best design solutions," Mr Lockyer said.
"The most highly awarded architects in the country, lauded as innovators of residential design, most of their houses can't get building approval because they simply don't comply with any of the deemed regulations.
"Instead they have to manipulate interpretations in the code to scrape through the certification process and get finance." He said an example was the requirement for any windows opening to a void in the house to be restricted to a 120-millimetre gap.
"You can have a hole in the wall but if you have a window in that same hole, it cannot open more than 120 millimetres," Mr Lockyer said.
"That's what we're dealing with." He said building codes tended to look back rather than ahead. "A lot of the planning schemes in our cities talk about how houses should emulate something else that was built 100 years ago; they're all about retaining the character," said Mr Lockyer.
"We need to have planning schemes that talk about how will live in 100 years." But Master Builders deputy executive director Paul Bidwell said the current code worked well, and ensured new homes were built to a "six star environmental standard".
He said any further changes to make new houses carbon-neutral would probably mean extra costs."Our experience is in many of these things the costs far outweigh the benefits, so a comprehensive cost/benefit analysis would need to be done," Mr Bidwell said. "At the heart of the building code is safety and we think it responds very well to the risk of more floods and cyclones."

Fire chiefs press PM for action on climate change

A coalition of former fire chiefs has called on Scott Morrison and the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements to implement a number of climate change reforms to prevent the Black Summer from happening again.
An Emergency Leaders for Climate Action report, released on Thursday and developed with more than 150 experts, outlines 165 recommendations to help the nation better prepare for, and respond to, horror bushfire seasons.
The group is calling for the nation's medium and large aerial firefighting capability to be boosted, an Indigenous-led National Cultural Fire Strategy to complement and inform fuel management, and a national disaster fund - paid by a fossil fuel producer levy - to pay for climate-fuelled disaster costs.
Climate councillor and former Fire & Rescue NSW commissioner Greg Mullins said it was critical the Morrison government tackled the root cause of climate change by urgently phasing out fossil fuels to reach net zero emissions - a task he said he hoped would be included in the royal commission's final report.
"Climate change has pushed Australia into a new bushfire era where we must fundamentally rethink how we prepare for and manage this growing threat," he said.
"This plan outlines practical steps that all levels of government can take right now to better protect communities.
"It is important that the federal government takes these recommendations seriously and acts on them urgently." Mr Mullins told the commission last month longer bushfire seasons were restricting the ability of states to share firefighting resources across borders and called for greater national co-ordination to deal with climate change as it drives a spike in extreme weather events.
"I've been watching the enemy for 50 years now and the enemy's geared up, you could say, like they've suddenly got nuclear weapons," Mr Mullins said. "We're still trying to deal with that with conventional forces and we need more help." Other recommendations include establishing an independent insurance price monitor so that Australians in disaster-prone areas can still insure their homes, and a national strategy on climate change, health and wellbeing. Deloitte Access Economics partner Nicki Hutley said the estimated economic cost of the Black Summer had been $5bn.

Companies see dangers of climate change as risks 'materialise'

Financial risks to big businesses triggered by global warming have begun to "materialise" in Australia, helping to revive the political dynamic that first pushed the government to act on climate change a decade ago, according to the nation's former top public servant, Terry Moran.
Due to heightened environmental concerns from the public in the wake of the bushfire crisis and the fast-growing adoption of climate mitigation strategies by the private sector, Mr Moran said it was inevitable the government would soon take a tougher -position on climate and energy policy.
Mr Moran, secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet between 2008 and 2011, now chairs the Centre for Policy Development think-tank which has been instrumental in an overhaul of the local business, financial and regulatory approach to grappling with climate change.
In the space of a few short years, the CPD's work on climate-related financial disclosure, which encourages directors to consider global warming in how their businesses are run under threat of legal liability, has been endorsed by the Reserve Bank, the banking regulator and the corporate watchdog.
"I'm not dark in my views about these things. In a democracy like ours, most things are done on a 'just in time' basis rather than a 'clear-sighted, forward-thinking' basis," Mr Moran told The Australian.
"You can't do much in government unless the public wants it. But we've pretty much got there on climate action in Australia - aside from a few small regions," he said.
"Letting those small regions chart the course of action only works if the rest of the country is largely relaxed about the problem. But the rest of the population is no longer relaxed." The CPD, which focuses on long-term policy development, helped to produce a landmark legal opinion by Noel Hutley SC and barrister Sebastian Hartford Davis in 2016 which found directors could be held liable for failing to consider and disclose the risks climate change presented to businesses.
Last year, Reserve Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle was the third leading financial regulator to endorse the rationale behind the legal opinion in three years, warning climate change would have "first-order economic effects" on business in a speech following similar addresses by Australian Prudential Regulation Authority executive Geoff Summerhayes and the Australian Securities & Investments Commission's John Price.
As recently revealed by The Australian, ASIC will this year probe specific companies and sectors failing to heed the legal advice, which was last year endorsed by former High Court justice and royal commissioner Kenneth Hayne.
Mr Moran said the CPD's work was influential because it had brought big business and government into the conversation.
"We do research, then we convince government and industry about the merits of the research, and then we encourage them to get on and do something about it," Mr Moran said.
"We prefer to do it that way, rather than sternly lecture government, public servants and businesses on what they should do. It's only if they all agree on it that you've any chance. We try and take people on a journey and get them to first accept the need for action.
"Climate change is a risk to business management.
"A number of people in the financial sector don't want to see themselves faced with crises because of climate change. In Australia those risks are already materialising." A paper released last week by the Bank for International Settlements, the Switzerland-based group representing the world's central banks, warned the next financial crisis could be triggered by "green swan" events linked to wild fluctuations in asset prices vulnerable to climate change.
It urged governments to steer financial institutions and businesses towards accounting for climate-related risks in their investment decisions in a move that would act as "a form of shadow pricing on carbon".
Many Australian companies have made climate-related disclosures based on the G20's Financial Stability Board 2015 guidelines, known as the Taskforce for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures, which are helping boards and management account for a warming world in their investment decisions.
Global regulators have grown increasingly concerned with the economic "transition" risks of climate change or from policies enacted to cut emissions, such as orderly or abrupt changes in prices, stranded assets, or long-term productivity changes, as opposed to the physical risks of climate change - such as floods, droughts, fires or cyclones.
Recently, some of the world's largest investors have taken steps to move away from fossil fuel assets in their portfolios, including the world's biggest asset manager, BlackRock, which said it would ditch investments including thermal coal as part of a response to rising climate change concerns.
The US asset management giant headed by Larry Fink said the risks posed by global warming were set to trigger substantial changes in how it invests $US7 trillion ($10 trillion) in assets.
Mr Moran, who helped lead the development of Australia's response during the global financial crisis, said the country was now at a point where there was a "significant constituency" for government action on climate change.
He likened the public mood to the wave of sentiment that propelled both Kevin Rudd and John Howard to take serious climate policies to the 2007 election, following drought and harsh water restrictions.
"With the small exception of some parts of the fossil fuel industry, the financial sector and other business sectors now get it and are worried about where we are going if we don't attempt to deal with climate change," Mr Moran said.
An analysis from Citi has found "significant parts" of Australia's large businesses were "already behaving as if climate policy were in place".
Mr Moran said the community and business sector were leading the government, as was the case in the 1980s when industry groups, unions, economists, media groups, academics and the public had a "sense that something needed to be done"."In our democracy, we don't rely on government all the time," he said. "With climate change, businesses sees a big risk that needs to be handled."

Climate change `to hit security'

WASHINGTON: Climate change will pose profound strategic challenges to the US in coming decades, raising the prospect of military intervention to deal with the effects of violent storms, drought, mass migration and pandemics, The New York Times reported yesterday.
Citing military and intelligence analysts, the newspaper said climate-induced crises could topple governments, feed terrorist movements or destabilise regions.
The Times noted a shift in official thinking on climate change, which has hitherto centred on finding energy alternatives to fossil fuels, reducing emissions and negotiating an international climate treaty -- not on potential security threats.
Analysts, experts at the Pentagon and intelligence agencies are for the first time taking a serious look at the national security implications of climate change, the report said.
Recent war games and intelligence studies conclude that over the next 20 to 30 years, vulnerable regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and South and Southeast Asia, will face the prospect of food shortages, water crises and catastrophic flooding driven by climate change that could demand a US humanitarian relief or military response, the paper reported.
An exercise at the National Defence University last December explored the potential impact of a flood in Bangladesh that sent hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming into neighbouring India, touching off religious conflict, the spread of contagious diseases and vast damage to infrastructure.
``It gets real complicated real quickly,'' the deputy assistant secretary of defence for strategy, Amanda Dory, told the Times. She was working with a Pentagon group assigned to incorporate climate change into national security strategy planning.
Climate and energy legislation passed in June by the House of Representatives will be debated in the Senate next month. Proponents of the legislation will now have an added security argument to push their case.
A changing climate presents a range of challenges for the military, the Times reported, because many of its critical installations are vulnerable to rising seas and storm surges.
In Florida, Homestead Air Force Base was essentially destroyed by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, and Hurricane Ivan badly damaged Naval Air Station Pensacola in 2004.
Military planners are studying ways to protect the major naval stations in Norfolk, Virginia, and San Diego, California, from climate-induced rising seas and severe storms.
Another vulnerable installation is the British territory of Diego Garcia, an atoll in the Indian Ocean, that serves as a logistics hub for US and British forces and sits only about a metre above sea level.

VIRUS CHANGES CLIMATE WAR

As everyday life grinds to a halt, some activists are cheering the environmental benefits of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has added fresh rancour to the climate change debate. "Dear Greta," former television meteorologist and popular US climate change blogger Anthony Watts began in an open letter to teenage climate campaigner Greta Thunberg last week.
"So you got what you wanted. System change & economic slowdown is a real thing now. Airplanes, industry, jobs, restaurants, recreation, and schools are all shut down. Instead we have fear, poverty, misery, joblessness, economic ruin, and a bleak future. Happy now?" On the other side, Spanish climate activist, astrophysicist and philosopher Martin Lopez Corredoira observes the world economy has been turned upside down in a matter of weeks.
"Neither Greenpeace, nor Greta Thunberg, nor any other individual or collective organisation (has) achieved so much in favour of the health of the planet in such a short time," Lopez Corredoira wrote in a Science 2.0 blog post earlier this month.
"Venice â€¦ is now deathly silent. What a respite for the Venetians! What good news for the ecologists and tourist-haters!
"This positively affects the reduction of CO2 emission and â€¦ the destruction associated with holiday and professional conference tourism. It is certainly not very good for the economy in general, but it is fantastic for the environment." Lopez Corredoira said he did not wish ill on anyone but added: "Let us view the circumstance from an objective sociological point of view, without taking individuals into account, and think about the changes that are being produced in the world owing to the rise of this coronavirus." This is the emergency climate response that Extinction Rebellion has repeatedly been told was not possible. Yet the pandemic raises challenging questions for all sides of the environmental debate.
It piques strongly held positions on controversial topics - overpopulation, the treatment of wild animals, the politics of authoritarian rule and the role of technology, The crisis provides a test bed to assess the impact on climate and broader environmental health of reducing industrial emissions for an extended period.
Already it has forced businesses to push harder on technologies to work remotely, communicate digitally and cut down on air miles and lunch.
Former UN climate leader Christiana Figueres says there is a silver lining to the challenge. "If we really sustain several months of reduced travel we may realise that we don't have to travel as much," she says. "Can this have actual behavioural change impacts â€¦ maybe, and let's hope." The internet is full of memes celebrating a form of nature's revenge on humans. But UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has made clear that tackling the coronavirus pandemic, not climate change, is now the world's top priority. Guterres is still urging countries not to lose sight of the global warming challenge and the Paris climate accord but says all res-ources for now will be directed toward tackling the COVID-19 crisis.
China's communist regime has been able to force obedience from citizens but a core weakness has been exposed in the capacity of others to trust information and statistics from the state.
Highlighted, too, has been the extraordinary extent to which the developed world has outsourced its industrial production to China.
These realities could have big implications for how the world might view China, including on the issue of climate change action, in future.
In tackling COVID-19 and climate change, the US is more likely to embrace technology and private industry for answers. Electric carmaker and space enthusiast Elon Musk has quickly thrust himself into the role of industrialist troubleshooter.
The teams of engineers assembled by Musk to inject his brand into the rescue of Thai students from flooded caves in 2018 have been told to turn their expertise to making ventilators for US hospitals.
New York City mayor Bill de Blasio responded directly to Musk on Twitter last week.
"New York City is buying!" de Blasio said. "Our country is facing a drastic shortage and we need ventilators ASAP - we will need thousands in this city over the next few weeks. We're getting them as fast as we can but we could use your help! We're reaching out to you directly." The speed and uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic has left the otherwise most vocal climate change groups unsure where to turn. Europe is winding back the pace of green measures and it looks increasingly likely that what was supposed to be a groundbreaking global climate change meeting in Glasgow in November will be postponed or cancelled.
The default position of renewable energy campaigners has been an attempt to make a virtue of the COVID-19 crisis.
International Energy Agency executive director Fatih Birol says he is working to influence world leaders to ensure their stimulus programs are rich with green initiatives.
"I am telling them that we can use the current situation to step up our ambition to tackle climate change," Birol said last week.
"This is a historic opportunity for the world to, on one hand, create packages to recover the economy but, on the other hand, to reduce dirty investments and accelerate the energy transition." Closer to home, Australia's Climate Council says now "is exact-ly the right time to be spending on renewable energy infrastructure and zero emissions technology".
Another key message has been that leaders should trust the scientists on climate change, just as they are on the pandemic.
Not everyone is convinced this is a fair comparison.
US climate scientist Judith Curry says she does not accept that COVID-19 shows us how and why we need to act urgently on climate change.
"The main similarity between climate change and COVID-19 is they are both situations of deep uncertainty," she says.
"Apart from the brainwashed Extinction Rebellion folk, no one feels the urgent visceral need to drop everything and 'act' on climate change.
"The reason for that is that the potential adverse impacts of climate change have a long time horizon (decades to centuries), there is no simple 'action' that will reverse climate change, and premature actions could lock us into infrastructure that is not in our best long-term interests. And finally, diversion of all our resources to the climate change problem could make us more vulnerable to more urgent problems such as COVID-19." Curry says it remains to be seen what lessons will eventually be learned from the pandemic.
But there will be a new understanding of the loss of productivity from unnecessary business travel and a new questioning of international cruising.
There also may be some new data on the impact on climate of depressed economic activity.
NASA scientists have been able to track the steep decline in nitrogen dioxide levels over China in January and February to coincide with the lockdown of Chinese production because of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.
The decline in pollution levels began over Wuhan and then spread across the country.
As lockdowns spread in Europe and North America, the impact on industry will mirror the 2008 global financial crisis, which resulted in a significant fall in global greenhouse gas emissions.
The shutdown of international air travel will allow a more thorough test of studies conducted after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks in the US.
Those studies claimed a temporary stop to air flights over North America had a noticeable impact on climate.
A reduction in vapour trails, or contrails, it was claimed, had been responsible for a greater subsequent spread in temperatures between day and night.
In 2004, NASA scientist Patrick Minnis wrote that "increased cirrus coverage, attributable to air traffic, could account for nearly all of the warming observed over the United States for nearly 20 years starting in 1975".
The warming effect happened because the high-altitude clouds that contrails created tended to trap warm air, Minnis wrote. On balance, though contrails can both warm and cool, there is more of a warming effect.
Last year, Scientific American said the contrails left by aeroplanes were now so widespread that their warming effect was greater than that of all the carbon dioxide emitted by aeroplanes that had accumulated in the atmosphere since the first flight of the Wright brothers.
Meanwhile, studies already are under way to see if the shutdown in industrial production will have a measurable impact on atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide in the northern hemisphere.
Not so far.
Many will be hoping the bigger environmental impact will be on the illegal trade in bush meat and a greater preservation of wildlife.
There is a long history of Chinese abuses of the pangolin, or scaly anteater, a living dinosaur and the likely host to the COVID-19 virus.
Pangolin scales traditionally have been cooked in oil, butter, vinegar, boys' urine or roasted with earth or oyster shells to cure a variety of ills, including excessive nervousness and hysterical crying in children, women possessed by devils and ogres, malarial fever and deafness.
According to an article in the journal Nature in 1938 that described the uses, pangolin numbers already were in peril because of Chinese demand.
Russian billionaire and British media owner Evgeny Lebedev has said it would be sweet irony if the COVID-19 virus were the saviour of the world's most highly illegally traded animal.
Lebedev is patron of the conservation organisation Space for Giants and has visited wet markets such as those in Wuhan where COVID-19 is believed to have bred from bats, through pangolins, to become a threat to humans.
US environmentalist Michael Shellenberger agrees.
"Who would have thought that the wet live markets in China would be a major source of global chaos and economic challenge and mass death, but that is the real-ity," Shellenberger says.
"The animals are on top of each other and they are very unsanitary. Experts have been warning about those markets for two decades now.
"One of the things that ought to come out of this is that there ought to be some effort internationally to make sure countries get rid of these markets that are breeding grounds for these viruses and help countries move to more modern forms of meat production.
"The truth is that economic growth and lifting people out of poverty has been the most important way to reduce air pollution and negative impacts on the environment."The success of the developed world's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has significant impli-cations for how the world will deal with climate change into the future.

Companies count the cost of climate change

Just two years ago, Australia's largest horticultural company, Costa Group, was on a tear.
The company, founded in Geelong more than 120 years ago and listed on the stockmarket in 2015, had been transformed into a $2bn giant.
While the going was good, management was spruiking a plan to expand its avocado business as its "fifth pillar", after conquering the markets for berries, mushrooms, tomatoes and citrus fruits. Shares in Costa had surged 300 per cent in three years as it supplied an increasing amount of produce to supermarkets.
But last Tuesday, as large swathes of the country continued to suffer through the worst drought on record, Costa unveiled its fourth profit downgrade in 10 months.
According to the market statement, which came alongside an urgent $170m raising to prevent the company from breaching its debt covenants, the "prolonged and extreme dry and hot conditions" across the country had resulted in Costa producing fruit that was too small to sell at decent prices.
Having been floated in 2015 at $2.20, Costa quickly achieved market-darling status as its shares surged to $9. After the profit downgrade last week, Costa shares sunk a further 30 per cent in a single day. Now, at $2.70, the group is worth 70 per cent less than it was in 2018. More than $1bn in shareholder value has been demolished on the way down.
Costa may be the country's biggest fruit supplier, but it is just a small part of a global story about the impact climate change is already having on the economy.
While Canberra remains bogged down in an impasse over climate and energy policy, institutional investors, business groups and regulators are at the coalface, grappling with how to respond to the demands of climate change.
It is quickly becoming a norm that companies will sign legally binding documents alerting shareholders and the public to quantified risks about the threat climate change presents to the ongoing viability of their operations.
Commonwealth Bank, Australia's biggest company, told shareholders in its recent annual report that it was looking to stop financing thermal-coal mining and coal-fired power by 2030.
CBA is also a major lender to farmers. According to "scenario analysis" by the bank, grain-growing regions across Australia face falls in productivity in many areas of up to 50 per cent because of changes in rainfall patterns by 2060. Livestock farmers are expected to see profitability reduced by 40 per cent because of "a deterioration in pasture growth and quality", while dairy regions face similar falls.
"A key risk for declining dairy profitability is the incidence of consecutive days of significant heat stress," CBA said. "After five such days in a row, dairy cows can stop lactating, ceasing production." Last week, Bega Cheese issued its second profit warning since August, blaming drought, which has forced it to pay higher prices to secure milk supply. Shares in Bega sank 15 per cent on the news. The stock is down more than 50 per cent over the last year and now at its lowest point in six years.
The drought has forced companies to spend big to cover emerging gaps in the market. The lack of rain this year prompted the country to make a rare purchase of Canadian grain - its first wheat import in more than a decade.
GrainCorp CEO Mark Palmquist said "extraordinary circumstances" across eastern Australia also pushed the company to freight 2.3 million tonnes of grain from South and Western Australia to the east coast to meet demand after a terrible eastern harvest. GrainCorp even signed a multimillion-dollar deal to manage east coast grain production risk.
Australian Agricultural Co, the nation's biggest cattle company that runs more than half a million cattle across 24 stations and feedlots in Queensland and the Northern Territory, said extreme weather has cost it more than $100m as drought and floods played havoc with its operations.
According to cattle industry projections, drought and flooding has heavily impacted slaughter and herd levels resulting in the largest drop in the national herd in decades, which will take a number of years before the national herd is back to its longer-term average.
Citrus growers in the southern Murray region have reported the spot price of water for irrigation has risen from a long-term average of $135 per megalitre to touching $1000.
The Reserve Bank, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Australian Securities & Investments Commission have each argued climate change and the conversion to a low-carbon economy or a world with more erratic weather will have "first-order economic effects", and require companies to be more upfront with shareholders about the risks investors face in a warming world.
Appearing before a Senate estimates committee last month, Future Fund CEO David Neal, who oversees $160bn worth of savings, agreed with them.
ASIC commissioner John Price said a requirement for companies to warn shareholders of the anticipated effects of climate change on their businesses was "not only sound, but also relatively unremarkable".
"There has been a legal opinion to the effect that it is possible that directors who fail to consider climate change risks now could be found liable for breaching their duty of care and diligence in the future," Mr Price said.
"Whether or not an entity is materially exposed to climate risk must ultimately be determined -according to the particular circumstances applying in each company's case. But I do not believe it is reasonable to ignore the risk of any possible impact, and I believe many large shareholders and investors are of the same view." While there has been an increasing focus on protests from the Extinction Rebellion movement, activism from vegan trespassers kidnapping livestock, and calls for university endowments and sovereign wealth funds to divest from fossil fuel companies, market forces are already changing the way global firms operate.
Rio Tinto boss Jean-Sebastien Jacques told a London audience last week that miners needed to find new ways to respond to increasing demands from investors and communities for responsible mining practices.
Along with BHP, Rio is among a number of global mining companies being pushed by institutional investors wielding $US11 trillion ($16 trillion) to cut funding to lobby groups that drive policies inconsistent with the Paris climate accord. BHP told its shareholders this year it was poised to invest $400m to reduce carbon emissions across its operations and supply chain.
The nation's biggest superannuation fund, $170bn AustralianSuper, is leading the global investor stewardship movement, with a leadership role with the institutional investor group Climate Action 100+. Earlier this year, the investor group forced Glencore to cap coal production and is currently leading a campaign against 12 other Australian companies over carbon emissions.
AustralianSuper director of environmental, social and governance concerns Andrew Gray told The Australian climate change was a long-term investment risk. As a long-term investor, checking financial disclosure of climate risk was therefore something AustralianSuper needed to manage.
"What we're looking for is information from companies as to how they're positioned on the two key themes within climate change risk - the transition risk being the risks and opportunities that will emerge from the global transition to a lower carbon intensive economy, and the physical impact risk from changing weather patterns," Mr Gray said.
"The first part of the process is to assess climate change risks that each company has and how it influences our investment decision-making," he said. "The second way we approach it is via our stewardship function, which is where we engage with company boards and vote our shares." And it's not just big mining companies grappling with the economic effects of the environmental movement. Woolworths last week blamed a previous soft first-quarter sales figure from 2018 on "the removal of single-use plastic bags", among other things.
APRA member Geoff Summerhayes has warned there will be unavoidable short-term economic costs involved with the transition to a more environmentally friendly economy, but that avoiding any sort of mitigation would also carry longer-term costs.
Mr Summerhayes said a shift to a low-carbon economy was "already under way" due to consumer demand, investor decisions and regulatory responses.
Capitalism is already adapting to a world where climate change is impacting the economy, through disclosure by companies and investment choices by money managers.
The legal liability presented by the risk of climate change has grown in prominence in Australia since 2017, when the prudential regulator said climate change was a "material" risk to companies and warned that company directors could be liable if they failed to incorporate climate change risks into their financial models and disclose the risks they faced.
Mr Summerhayes said there was still a way to go for local businesses in adopting a framework of climate disclosure. "Globally there are 800 large institutions, representing about $10 trillion of assets, that have taken up the framework, including a number of large institutions in Australia," he said.
"As impressive as that sounds, that's a fraction of the number of companies globally, and the $10 trillion needs to be seen in the context of $88 trillion GDP."But the question we would ask is: if you're not disclosing under that framework, why not?"

Investors put big business in climate change crosshairs

Investment funds representing more than $US35 trillion ($52.2 trillion) have warned Australia's largest companies they will be held to account on climate change, as they use their clout to demand action from businesses including BHP, Rio Tinto and Wesfarmers.
The global cohort of investors, which includes Australia's largest super funds, has declared business leaders must do more to mitigate climate change investment risk and cautioned against the threat posed by industry associations whose climate views are inconsistent with the companies they represent.
Funds and other industry players have also called out policy uncertainty on climate change as one of the challenges facing corporate Australia, just days after Scott Morrison hit back at critics, saying Australia had "nothing to apologise for over climate change".
AustralianSuper head of environmental, social and governance issues Andrew Gray said: "One of our roles as investors is to use our influence to improve company behaviour for the purpose of managing the investment risk in climate change. The momentum (from engaging with companies) has been great. But much more still needs to be done." The $170bn AustralianSuper said it looked for boards to demonstrate appropriate oversight on climate change risks and skills to manage them. "Accordingly, director -voting must inevitably consider climate change risk management as an integral role of the board at companies where this is a -material business issue," Mr Gray said.
Climate Action 100+, an -investor-led initiative formed to pressure the world's largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to take more action on climate change, released its inaugural progress report on Wednesday. It revealed that of 161 target companies - 13 of which are Australian - 70 per cent have set long-term emissions reduction targets but just 9 per cent have emissions targets in line with or better than the minimum goal outlined in the Paris Agreement that seeks to keep the rise in global temper-atures to below 2C.
The 13 Australian companies targeted by the global network are Adelaide Brighton, AGL -Energy, BHP, BlueScope Steel, Boral, Origin Energy, Qantas Airways, Rio Tinto, Santos, South32, Wesfarmers, Woodside Petroleum and Woolworths.
The group of investors includes Australian super funds such as HESTA, UniSuper, -QSuper and First State Super.
Climate Action 100+ praised companies that it said had shown "first-wave leadership", including BHP, which had committed to net-zero emissions by the middle of the century and in July said it would develop technologies to -reduce emissions from its operations as well as those generated from the use of its resources.
The miner has come under renewed pressure in recent weeks over its memberships with industry associations such as the Minerals Council of Australia. Shareholders last month put forward a resolution, to be voted on at its upcoming annual general meeting, calling for it to suspend such memberships. Activists claimed the lobby groups undermined the goals of the Paris Agreement. BHP has since said it is reviewing these memberships.
The Climate Action report showed that although 77 per cent of companies had clear board responsibility for climate, less than 8 per cent had alignment between the lobbying undertaken by their industry associations and their stated policy position.
"If a company has a position on climate change, and the industry association they're a member of is inconsistent with that position, that actually creates an investment and business risk because the industry association is not necessarily advocating for what the company themselves sees as important," Mr Gray said.
His comments were echoed by Emma Herd, chief executive of Investor Group on Climate Change. She said lobbying was "a key issue of concern".
"There's been a lot of frustrations from investors around our inability to get resolution on climate policy," Ms Herd said. "And a lot of scrutiny around the role that industry associations are playing in that discussion and a lot of discussion with companies on how they are communicating to their industry associations what their expectations are." AustralianSuper had not yet decided how it would vote at the BHP AGM, Mr Gray said, but it was "actively considering all the issues around it".
Unisuper environmental, social and governance analyst Sybil Dixon said companies were getting the message on climate change action but policy -certainty would help to set a clear direction.
"The aims of the Paris Agreement are quite clear," Ms Dixon said. "The Australian government has signed up to those aims and the longer we put off trying to come to a clear action, the more difficult it makes it." Debby Blakey, chief executive of the $51bn HESTA super fund, said the fund had engaged with companies to seek improved disclosure, Paris-aligned target setting and the linking of targets to executive remuneration."Investors want to see targets set and clear pathways to progress so they can price climate risk and allocate capital accordingly," Ms Blakey said.

Climate change the hottest theme at this year's Venice Biennale

The installations are polemical rather than arresting
Artists have long been inspired by the great issues of their day. Eugene Delacroix's topless Liberty celebrated the revolution that toppled the French king in 1830. Picasso's Guernica mourned the horror of the Spanish civil war.
Earlier this month a panel backed by the UN warned that one million species were under threat due to human interference. So it is fitting the Venice Biennale, which opened as those findings were released, should at last have discovered the theme of climate change. Alas, much of the resulting art is polemical rather than arresting.
For instance, Christine and Margaret Wertheim's hand-crocheted coral reefs look good on Instagram, but in May You Live in Interesting Times, an international exhibition curated by Ralph Rugoff of the Hayward Gallery in London, they fall flat.
In the Biennale's national pavilions, the Canadians are showing well-meaning videos about the impact of the changing climate on the Inuit people. Artists in the Nordic pavilion have strung leguminous loops of green tissue and red "seaweed" on a clothesline - human-ity has hung the planet out to dry.
One of the most memorable previous examples of climate-change art was Olafur Eliasson's Weather Project, in which the Icelandic artist rigged up a huge circular mirror and orange lights to suffuse Tate Modern's Turbine Hall in a golden glow. It seemed to bring the sun into the lives of the more than two"million people who visited the show in 2003; it returns this July. Two artists who seem to be influenced by that installation are Joan Jonas and Dane Mitchell.
Both have brought powerful works to Venice (itself threatened by rising seas). In the New Zealand pavilion, Mitchell has gathered a list of three million things that no longer exist - extinct species but also ghost towns, discontinued perfumes, vanished borders. The list is being declaimed in what amounts to an epic poem of loss; the history of progress, it implies, is also a history of obsolescence. The rollcall is so long it can be read out for eight hours a day, seven days a week for the six months of the Biennale, and no item will ever be repeated.
Jonas combines film and performance in a piece created for Ocean Space, a new platform that brings together scientists and artists. On a stage in a Venetian church, she dances and mimes like a water wraith. Behind her is a video she shot of the ocean around Jamaica. At nearly 83, Jonas slips into the blue. In a chiffon dress she glides through the water - a reminder that humans emerged from the sea and many still live by its bounty. With climate-change art, it is the effect on the heart, as much as the head, that counts.THE ECONOMIST

Heat here to stay as climate change makes its presence felt

Australia's land and ocean surface temperatures have risen by about 1C since 1910 and are expected to keep warming due to climate change, the nation's landmark clim-ate survey has found.
The biennial report by the Bureau- of Meteorology and CSIRO says observations and clim-ate modelling paint a consistent picture of ongoing, long-term climate change interacting with underlying natural variability.
The bureau's manager of clim-ate monitoring, Karl Braganza, said Australia was already exper-iencing the effects of climate change with record-breaking heat now commonplace across the country. "Some of the record-breaking extreme heat we have been seeing recently will be considered normal in 30 years' time," Dr Braganza said.
According to the bureau and CSIRO, Australia experienced its three warmest springs on record in 2013, 2014 and last year.
There had been an increase in fire weather and a longer fire season across southern and eastern Australia since the 1970s.
In these regions, the number of days with weather conducive to fire was likely to increase. "Whilst the observations show us increased rainfall in some parts of Australia, we have also seen significant seasonal decline, such as in the April-October growing season, where an 11 per cent decline in rainfall has been experienced in the continental southeast since the mid-1990s," Dr Braganza said.
"The changing climate significantly affects all Australians through increased heatwaves, more significant wet weather events and more severe fire weather conditions." The main findings were that: â€¢ The duration, frequency and intensity of extreme heat events had increased across large parts of Australia; â€¢ There has been an increase in extreme weather, and a longer season, across large parts of the nation since the 1970s; â€¢ May-July rainfall has reduced by about 19 per cent since 1970 in the southwest; â€¢ There has been a decline of about 11 per cent since the mid-1990s in the April-October growing season rainfall in the continental southeast; â€¢ Rainfall has increased across parts of the north since the 1970s; â€¢ Oceans around Australia have warmed and ocean acidity levels have increased; â€¢ Sea levels have risen around Australia. The rise in mean sea level amplifies the effects of high tides and storm surges.
Future projections were for more extremely hot days and fewer extremely cool days. The number of days with weather conducive to fire in the south and east is projected to increase.
Globally, average CO2 levels in the atmosphere were almost certain to average more than 400 parts per million this year.
Last year had been the hottest since records began in 1880 and average sea levels had risen by more than 20cm since the late 19th century.About one-third of that rise was due to ocean warming and the rest from melting land ice and changes in the amount of water stored on the land, the BOM/ CSIRO report said.

In these regions, the number of days with weather conducive to fire was likely to increase. "Whilst the observations show us increased rainfall in some parts of Australia, we have also seen significant seasonal decline, such as in the April-October growing season, where an 11 per cent decline in rainfall has been experienced in the continental southeast since the mid-1990s," Dr Braganza said.
"The changing climate significantly affects all Australians through increased heatwaves, more significant wet weather events and more severe fire weather conditions." The main findings were that: â€¢ The duration, frequency and intensity of extreme heat events had increased across large parts of Australia; â€¢ There has been an increase in extreme weather, and a longer season, across large parts of the nation since the 1970s; â€¢ May-July rainfall has reduced by about 19 per cent since 1970 in the southwest; â€¢ There has been a decline of about 11 per cent since the mid-1990s in the April-October growing season rainfall in the continental southeast; â€¢ Rainfall has increased across parts of the north since the 1970s; â€¢ Oceans around Australia have warmed and ocean acidity levels have increased; â€¢ Sea levels have risen around Australia. The rise in mean sea level amplifies the effects of high tides and storm surges.
Future projections were for more extremely hot days and fewer extremely cool days. The number of days with weather conducive to fire in the south and east is projected to increase.
Globally, average CO2 levels in the atmosphere were almost certain to average more than 400 parts per million this year.
Last year had been the hottest since records began in 1880 and average sea levels had risen by more than 20cm since the late 19th century.About one-third of that rise was due to ocean warming and the rest from melting land ice and changes in the amount of water stored on the land, the BOM/ CSIRO report said.

Climate change is not the era's burning issue

Drought and fire are common in Australia, and always have been Stoic. We used to be stoic and sensible. And proudly so.
In Britain this was encapsulated by the wartime poster "Keep calm and carry on". Here in Australia we have exhibited a phlegmatic hardiness down the gen-erations, dealing with all that a sunburnt country of droughts and flooding rains could throw at us.
Now hysteria reigns. That British poster today would read, "Cry panic and herald Armageddon". The Australian visage of calm practicality has been replaced by a Munch-like scream.
On Christmas Day 1974, households around the nation were shocked by news coming through from Darwin and rang to offer their homes to house families evacuated in the wake of Cyclone Tracy. If it happened today many people would go and protest against the climate instead.
Rational arguments, hard facts and intelligent debate have been cast aside in favour of woke whingeing. In this information age, ill-informed emotionalism dominates public debate (although thankfully the great mainstream remain level-headed and smart, as they showed in this year's so-called climate election).
We live in an age when Greta Thunberg can be named person of the year for doing nothing more than allowing herself to be the face of protest, bringing teenage hyperventilation to what should be a -rational and scientific policy -debate. She is to the climate debate what the Bay City Rollers were to music.
But she is far from alone. When Sydney was smothered in bushfire smoke this week The Sydney Morning Herald published Mark Mordue. "There is no other way to see it," he wrote, "our dead future is here." In The Guardian Australia Charlotte Wood wrote about her trauma from Sydney's inner-west suburb of Marrickville. "We're used to turning our attention briefly, -intensely, to 'those poor people'- -affected by climate change, then returning to normal life," Wood wrote, without telling us who or what she was referring to. "Now those poor people include us." The New York Times fed the hyperbole, quoting novelist Anna Funder looking at bushfires on a flight into Sydney. "It was as if the country were being devoured by a chemical reaction," she said.
"Dear prime minister," Katharine Murphy wrote in The Guardian Australia, "the country is not parched but desiccated, and it is burning like a tinderbox, and people are frightened." Remember when journalism was about facts?
A host of people from the prominent to the anonymous took to social media to tell us that "Australia is burning". NSW Environment Minister Matt Kean blamed the fires on climate change - without evidence.
Rather than explain what his department had done or failed to do to reduce fuel loads in national parks and forests - the one part of the bushfire equation humans can control - he promised more action on carbon emissions reductions policies that, of course, can and will never do anything to -reduce or alleviate the bushfire threat. Yet, in this post-rational age, he was applauded by many.
People rallied in the streets not to offer their services with other fire volunteers for hard yakka on the frontline with backpacks and rakes or making sandwiches to help; no, they rallied for more government action on carbon emissions reductions. We have reached an absurdity when people blame governments for deliberately lit fires and the smoke they produce. Grown adults blame governments for weather.
Therese Rein, wife of former prime minister Kevin Rudd, took to social media to sheet home blame for destructive fires at the feet of Scott Morrison. Needless to say, she has never publicly blamed her husband for the 170 deaths on Black Saturday, when Rudd was prime minister just over a decade ago.
The divide in approaches was illustrated by the actions of two other former prime ministers. While Tony Abbott has spent weeks on distant fire fronts vol-unteering with his local Rural Fire Service brigade, Malcolm Turnbull jetted back to Sydney, posted a picture of the smoke and said we needed to take more climate action.
The silliness is constantly reinforced in the media. ABC presenters ask daily inane gotcha questions. Hamish Macdonald -demanded drought tsar Shane Stone declare whether anthropogenic global warming was a thing, and Michael Rowland demanded to know whether federal Communications Minister Paul Fletcher would join Kean in blaming climate change for bushfires.
The point about this game-playing is that nothing turns on the answers, except to desired creation of political embarrassment or the chance to shame someone for defying the zeitgeist. Whatever we do to combat drought and bushfire is what we have always done - build dams, supply feed, reduce fuel, protect houses and so on - because these are threats that are endemic to our land.
The expert analysis shows that if there is a long-term influence from climate change on either of these blights, it will be to make each of them slightly more common in a land where they are common already. Whatever Australia does on carbon emissions can have no impact on any of this, at least for decades to come as global emissions continue to rise. And if, at some unlikely time in the future, international resolve sees substantial cuts in global greenhouse gas emissions, Australia will still be a land menaced by drought and fire. There is no drought-free and bushfire-free Nirvana awaiting us, no matter how much nonsense we hear from Kean, Turnbull and Thunberg. It is only the practical that matters. Yet it is usually the gotcha moments, emotional cries and virtue signalling that dominate the public debate. We are our own worst enemies.
Look at the ridiculous coverage and response given to the Climate Change Performance Index -released in Madrid this week. It is the work of European climate activist think tanks - comparable to The Australia Institute in our country - yet their findings are reported as though they are dispassionate assessments.
The overall ratings had the US ranked last and Australia third from last despite both these developed nations having reduced emissions and, in our case, being committed to further reductions. China - a country that is increasing its emissions -annually by more than Australia's total emissions - was ranked almost 30 places above Australia. India, too, was ranked high on the list. Australia was marked down for approving the Adani coalmine but India was given a leave pass for burning the coal. The index pays more -regard to climate politics and -posturing than to emissions facts and outcomes.
Yet this week ABC opinionista Barrie Cassidy tweeted about the index by saying: "I don't think we've ever had a government so out of touch with a national concern and an opposition so incap-able of putting pressure on them." I guess Cassidy has already forced himself to forget the "climate election" of seven months ago.
Labor leader Anthony Albanese also used the index to criticise the government's performance and his frontbencher Mark Dreyfus said our nation was now an "international embarrassment". But the ALP's climate spokesman, Mark Butler, would not be outdone: "Australia is burning. We can feel the impacts of climate change. Scott Morrison's climate policy is ranked dead last, below Donald Trump. This is a crisis and the government won't act." Against all this panic and politicking, we need to consider the facts. In NSW this has been a bad bushfire season, one of the worst the state has seen, certainly since 1974. With NSW's drier winters and wetter summers, the season is usually earlier and less intense than the most bushfire-prone states of Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania.
With widespread fires this year the smoke haze has been bad too. But, again, not unprecedented.
In 1936 the smoke haze was so bad in Sydney a ship from Hong Kong, the Neptuna, struggled to find the heads and sounded its foghorn but the harbourmaster couldn't find the ship or see across the harbour. In 1951 all Sydney airports, from Mascot, through Bankstown to Richmond, were shut for hours because the smoke was too thick for planes to land.
Apart from rampant arson, the reason NSW's fire season is bad is the drought. On this point it is -important to note the clear assessments of University of NSW's -Andrew Pitman, who heads the Centre of Excellence for Climate Extremes. "This may not be what you -expect to hear but as far as the climate scientists know, there is no link between climate change and drought," he said. "Now, that may not be what you read in the newspapers and sometimes hear commented but there is no reason a priori why climate change should make the landscape more arid.
"And if you look at the Bureau of Meteorology data over the whole of the last 100 years there's no trend in data, there's no drying trend, there's been a drying trend in the last 20 years but there's been no drying trend in the last 100 years and that's an expression of how variable the Australian rainfall climate is." When Pitman was embarrassed by the use of his quote in the climate debate, he issued a statement saying he should have used the word "direct" - so there is no "direct link" between the drought and climate change.There you have it. Most of the rest is just noise.

IMMIGRATION AND CLIMATE CHANGE BLOCK COMPROMISE ROAD

Two polarising issues rule out any bipartisanship
TWO of the most polarising policy debates in this country are climate change and immigration, the latter specifically in relation to asylum-seekers. The economy will again take centre stage this year, in the wake of some horrendous numbers delivered in the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook by Joe Hockey last month. Flanked by the twin issues of immigration and climate change, any bipartisanship remains an unlikely proposition.
The irony is that while the Left abhors what it sees as fearmongering by the Right over boat arrivals (we have seen plenty of that: remember Tony Abbott in opposition discussing the "invasion" threat to the mainland), the exact same fearmongering occurs in the policy area of climate change.
Left-wingers often attribute individual climate phenomena to climate change, even though experts caution against such politicking. The droughts of the recent past were put down to climate change, just as the floods that soon followed were seen as examples of increasing climatic unpredictability. Never mind the ever-present nature of the seasons in this sunburnt country and land of sweeping plains.
Equally, climate change splits the Right when it comes to what should be done to prevent or mitigate it, just as the handling of asylum boats splits the Left, as it grapples with balancing Australia's international treaty obligations and the need to "stop the boats" for political purposes. The immigration debate has been complicated by a shift within the Right to justify stopping the boats as a mantra that has strong humanitarian underpinnings because it prevents drownings at sea. The Left has been uncertain how to combat this approach, having long felt it had a mortgage on the moral high ground on the issue.
The paradox of these twin issues continues, with the Left using the Right's opposition to emissions trading to ridicule it for failing to embrace a market mechanism to deal with climate change - a supposed cornerstone of liberalism. Economic liberals within the Liberal Party find this situation troubling, especially when they are spending billions of dollars on a direct action policy that sees the government picking winners in a way more in tune with old Labor.
Unfortunately, the polarised nature of these debates prevents Australia finding the right balance. Our political system, including the existence of compulsory voting, has always been seen as one that brings our major parties to the political centre. The Senate, too, used to help with this process, but not any more.
Today, the robust advantage that comes from enhancing the partisan divide in some areas has ensured key policy scripts present voters with a black-and-white choice. In a political culture where voter dealignment is strong, stronger than at any time in our history, this is a recipe for dissatisfaction with the political class.
Support the Coalition's border protection policies and there is no room for adhering to international treaty obligations. There can be no debate about the need to put a lens on practices within offshore detention centres because to do so could "weaken" our resolve in the eyes of people-smugglers.
On climate change the almost religious adherence by the Left to increasing emissions targets and embracing an emissions trading scheme ignores the subtle realities of the need to strike global agreements for such a scheme to work. Scaremongering about individual climate events opens the way for the hard Right to mock the Left's passion for action, making it more difficult for the moderate Right to drag its leaders to the centre.
In his book Triumph and Demise, Paul Kelly chronicles how climate change nearly split the Liberal Party in opposition during Malcolm Turnbull's stint as leader. It certainly nearly did, and risks doing so again if moderates seek to embrace the need for action beyond the existing 2020 target or beyond spending pledges for Direct Action (more than $2 billion).
The danger for Abbott is that the parliamentary Liberal Party is far more moderate on paper than he is. A traditional conservative, Abbott doesn't have that many allies. He is outnumbered in a way John Howard never was.
There is also a threat that Labor's left flank will cause friction within Bill Shorten's team in the policy area of asylum-seekers. Deputy leader Tanya Plibersek is especially uncomfortable with moving to the right on issues such as boat turnbacks and tougher off-shore processing. But if Shorten allows the differences between he and Abbott to show, it could rebound on him electorally.
The voting structures for the Labor leadership empower the Left because the membership has long shown a propensity to favour left-wing candidates, as the leadership contest against Anthony Albanese highlighted.
The two policy realities concerning the twin issues of asylum-seekers and climate change the Right and the Left won't face up to are rarely discussed.
If Liberals want to continue to deny entry for so-called "queue jumpers", they should withdraw Australian endorsement of international asylum-seeker conventions that stipulate our processing and turn-back policies are illegal.
They should also pursue a regional solution with non-signatory nations, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Perhaps then the successful short-term tactics would be followed up with long-term solutions.
The problem with Labor's climate change stance is that it focuses on mitigating emissions rather than planning for climate change. Most people would acknowledge that even if they believe the science of climate change (which is overwhelming), the science of reversing its effects is far less certain.
In fact, most scientists now accept that a dual strategy of planning for the consequences of climate change, as well as trying to reduce emissions, is what a nation such as Australia should adopt.
With global agreements patchy and non-binding at best, the reality of increasing emissions in heavily populated developing countries such as China, India, Indonesia and Brazil all count against some sort of rearguard action to stop what is now unstop-pable momentum towards warmer climates and less predictable weather patterns.
Salvation is to plan for it rather than try and prevent it. By focusing on unachievable prevention strategies, especially when a global agreement is so unlikely, the Left gives political power to sceptics who seek the thwart any form of spending on climate change.
This year's inevitable focus on the economy, economic growth and fiscal strategies to bring the budget back into the black may give all sides time to consider the important subjects of immigration and climate change. But judging by the combative nature of modern politics, and Shorten's desire to do unto Abbott what Team Abbott in opposition did unto Labor, change in 2015 to the polarising nature of key political debates seems unlikely.

Banks first in the queue as schedule for APRA's climate change stress tests is revealed

Australian banks will be the first sector in the firing line for the prudential regulator's tough new -institutionally focused climate change stress tests, which will be rolled out following the launch of new economic and environmental scenario modelling by global central banks next year.
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority will then target the $45bn general insurance sector with its audits on the vulnerability of companies to a potentially "disorderly" transition to a low-emissions economy.
Finally, superannuation fund managers overseeing the nation's $3 trillion pile of retirement savings will feel the heat of APRA's soon-to-be-launched climate stress tests, which will measure how the funds are preparing their portfolios for an unpredictable -future in which asset prices could fluctuate wildly depending on the rate of warming of the planet or the policies put in place to achieve emissions targets.
Regulatory sources have confirmed to The Weekend Australian the running order for the sectors soon to face an Australian prudential probe measuring the exposure of banks, insurers and super funds to both the physical risks of climate change - such as floods, droughts, fires or cyclones - and the economic "transition" risks, such as orderly or abrupt changes in prices, possible stranded assets, or long-term productivity changes.
The insights from the stress tests could be used to encourage companies to exit potentially risky assets or investments, reprice policies or loans, or even to force banks and insurers that refuse to ready themselves for an unpredictable climate to hold more capital as a buffer in times of crisis. The climate models to be used to analyse the financial strength of companies are being developed by an international group of regulators, chaired by Bank of England governor Mark Carney, who this week warned that large financial groups in the UK would imminently face the world's toughest climate stress tests.
As revealed by The Australian this week, the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), chaired by Mr Carney, is due to finalise a number of climate transition scenarios in the first half of 2020, at which point APRA will begin tuning the economic models to the local context to begin stress testing large financial institutions.
The Reserve Bank, a member of the group, will use the financial models to analyse economy-wide impacts of climate change and policies seeking to shift the nation to a low-emissions future. The Australian Securities & Investments Commission will also be engaged in the work, mostly through monitoring whether companies are properly disclosing known risks to shareholders.
Mr Carney this week said the BoE would measure UK financial companies against three scenarios, which were under development by the NGFS. "The catastrophic business-as-usual scenario where no further climate action is taken, a scenario where early policy action delivers an orderly transition to the targets set in Paris, and a third where late policy action leads to a disorderly and disruptive transition," Mr Carney said. This aligns closely to recent remarks by APRA executive Geoff Summerhayes, who chairs the global Sustainable Insurance Forum, who said Australian regulators were contemplating "three broad models" of climate change scenarios and what the ensuing "implications would be for assets and business models" stemming from those scenarios.
"A hothouse world, where there is no discernible change to the warming profile; an orderly adjustment to a lower-carbon future, which would envisage a significant amount of transition risk, albeit smooth; and a late adjustment where the world continues to warm and there is a realisation from a policy sense much later in the piece which requires a very rapid adjustment to a lower-carbon future," Mr Summerhayes told parliament this month.
"Each of those scenarios has implications for the pricing of assets, for business models, for physical impacts and liability impacts to a range of firms' investments." Fitch Ratings head of sustainable finance Andrew Steel on Friday said the gap between how ambitious global governments pledge to cut emissions and the -actual policies in place to reach those targets highlighted the "risk of a sharp shift" in the global regulatory environment. Mr Steel said the possibility that global governments could ratchet up carbon pricing policies to meet emissions targets was a key risk to company credit ratings.
The Australian Competition & Consumer Commission on Friday said home insurance in northern Australia was becoming "increasingly unaffordable" and was, on average, double the cost of policies in the rest of the country. Deputy chair Delia Rickard said high insurance prices threatened the "resilience, liveability and prosperity of our northern regions".
The share of homeowners going without insurance in northern Queensland nearly doubled to 17 per cent between 2011 and 2016. The top end of WA has a non-insurance rate of 40 per cent.
As part of its investigation into rising insurance prices in areas exposed to natural disasters, one local insurer told the ACCC that in "the context of ongoing climate change" it had "limited appetite for concentration risk arising from natural perils".
When too many residents wanted insurance in -locations vulnerable to climate--related disasters, it rejected new applications or increased policy prices to reduce its exposure.
"Two insurers also stated that climate change risk and their associated cost allowances will be incrementally incorporated into premiums as customers renew their premiums," the ACCC said.
Climate-related insurance losses across the world last year were the fourth highest on record at $US76bn ($110bn), according to KPMG, while 2017 was the worst year on record.
In the first survey of its kind, APRA earlier this year found all of the 38 large institutions it surveyed were taking steps to understand the threat of climate change.
A third of the group of banks, insurance companies and superannuation funds believed climate change was an immediate "material financial risk" to their businesses, while 20 companies believed climate change will be a risk in the future.Four of seven banks said energy-related risks were the most pertinent, while one bank said rising sea levels was its biggest risk. Insurance companies were most concerned by risks such as floods and cyclones. Life insurance firms feared heat stress for customers.

Humans affect climate change

THE Australian Academy of Science has pitted its expertise against the greenhouse sceptics in a report firmly stating that human activity is changing our climate.
The statement expresses for the first time the consensus among Australia's top climate scientists on the evidence for human-caused global warming.
In it, nine eminent climate scientists declare that global average temperatures has risen during the past century, and that increased greenhouse gas levels due to human activity are mostly to blame. The academy issued the statement, The Science of Climate Change: Questions and Answers, in Canberra on Monday as part of National Science Week.
The document sets out the evidence for human impact on climate and outlines the possible consequences of failure to make deep cuts to greenhouse gas emissions.
It synthesises the latest peer-reviewed research and identifies areas of scientific uncertainty, such as regional impacts and tipping points: thresholds that, if crossed, could send the climate system awry.
Kurt Lambeck, immediate past president of the academy and a professor at the Australian National University's research school of earth sciences, initiated work on the document to clear up common misconceptions.
``I was getting frustrated with the level of the debate on climate change, and the general confusion it was creating in the broader community,'' he said. ``One of the reasons that was occurring was that the science was getting so complex.
``A lot of the genuine scientific debate is about issues that are largely second order things, and they do not impinge on our principal understanding of climate change.''
He said the fundamental principles of climatology, such as the role of carbon dioxide in global warming, were beyond dispute. But scientists were still arguing about the complex Earth systems feedback mechanisms, such as the possible cooling effect of clouds.
``If temperatures go up, there is going to be more evaporation, and that will produce more clouds,'' Professor Lambeck said. ``That could produce a negative feedback, but to quantify that is a very difficult thing.
``How do we put that cloud cover into the models? That's where uncertainty comes in, but that's not going to change the basic outcomes.''
Among the authors of the academy's report are David Karoly, of the University of Melbourne; Matthew England, of the University of NSW; Michael Bird, of James Cook University; and the CSIRO's Mike Raupach.
``They have identified the questions,'' Professor Lambeck said. ``They've debated the answers. Here is the best advice you can get from the scientific community by real experts in their fields in climate science.''
A seven-member committee of experts reviewed the document, which concluded: ``Decisions will need to be made before we have absolute certainty about the future.''

Climate changes in backflip week

It's been a big week for ministers doing backflips. Energy Minister Angus Taylor kicked it off on Tuesday with his "low emissions technology roadmap", followed by Communications Minister Paul Fletcher's NBN backflip on Wednesday, and then on Thursday Josh Frydenberg "recalibrated" fiscal policy.
The problem with the NBN was that Tony Abbott never bothered to understand it, he only ever saw it in political terms: it was a Labor thing, so it had to go. His then communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, managed to stop him destroying it entirely but it became fibre to the copper, not to us. Now it's fibre all the way, for a price.
As for the Treasurer, Thursday's budget warm-up speech was just the beginning of the somersaults required.
The Australian banking system is strong, but not strong enough to withstand more than a few mort-gagors trying to live on $40 a day.
Frydenberg will have to do a lot more than recalibrate. He, along with every -finance minister in the world, will have to join central bankers in "Whatever It Takes" land, and just do whatever it takes.
Taylor's flip was the most subtle, but ultimately the most interesting, and possibly the most important. He launched a document titled First Low Emissions Technology Statement - 2020, produced by Chief Scientist Alan Finkel, former Origin Energy and Business Council head Grant King, Macquarie's Shemara Wikramana-yake and Coca-Cola Amatil's Alison Watkins, among others.
Its main purpose is to defend the Coalition's resistance to putting a price on carbon, but with it has come a fundamental shift in official language: the science is no longer contested.
Taylor now just talks about emissions reduction not electricity price reduction, and what's more he is sleeping with the enemy.
When King headed the Business Council of Australia, it produced a policy calling for net zero emissions by 2050 that still stands. Macquarie and Coca-Cola Amatil were then, and still are, members of the BCA.
The Coalition government is about the only significant hold-out in Australia against net zero emissions by 2050, and the technology roadmap released by Taylor is a last-ditch effort to hold off the scientists and business leaders calling for that target - and therefore for a carbon price, since that's what would be required - by throwing money at them for research and development. And to be fair, that usually works.
After the last feeble attempt to forcibly limit carbon emissions collapsed with the National Energy Guarantee in 2017, the government tried to tough it out with a focus on energy prices, but when Zali Steggall won Warringah off Abbott last year, and Greta Thunberg rose to global stardom, it became clear that something else was needed. Thus, technology.
A panel was formed, and Finkel put in charge. His Clean Energy Target from June 2017 sits in the bulging hard drive of ignored ideas, although his subsequent National Hydrogen Strategy had more success because it involves spending taxpayers' money.
The panel's output is basically a wish list of low emission technology ideas, starting with cheap -hydrogen, followed by cheap -storage, cheap carbon capture and cheap soil carbon. All of them will require pots of taxpayers' money and take decades to happen.
Well before those distant breakthroughs comes November this year: first there's the Glasgow conference of parties, which is likely to commit the world to net zero emissions by 2050 and then, while everyone's still in Scotland, the US election, which could change everything.
If Joe Biden wins, he will commit the US to zero emission electricity by 2035 and then net zero emissions for the whole country by 2050.
Meanwhile, China's President Xi Jinping jumped the gun in his speech to the UN General Assembly this week with a new commitment "to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality (net zero emissions) before 2060".
Net zero global emissions by 2050, or even Xi's 2060, is a crushingly tough target, probably unachievable but economically transformational in the attempt.
Whoever signs up to it is also agreeing to put a price on carbon, because there would be no other way (Taylor's technology roadmap included).
By the way, the great irony of the Coalition government's 11-year-old refusal to put a price on carbon, having triumphantly repealed the Labor Party's effort in 2014, is that it already has one. It's currently $15.74 a tonne.
Two weeks ago the Clean Energy Regulator held its 11th carbon abatement reverse auction under the "direct action" plan originally launched by Abbott as the Coalition's alternative to Labor's Clean Energy Act of 2011, the one that introduced an emissions trading scheme with a three-year fixed price of $23 a tonne.
The abatement auctions conducted by the CER use taxpayers' money to "buy" emissions reductions, rather than imposing a cost penalty on them.
CER chairman David Parker's main instruction appears to have been to make sure he never pays anywhere near $23; his prices range from $10.23 per tonne in April 2016 to $16.14 in March this year.
This month's auction was 7 million tonnes of abatement for a total of $110.3m, so an average of $15.74 a tonne.
A price of $23 would have -attracted a much larger number of abatement projects, but both the money, and the will, are strictly limited.
And if the current EU emissions trading scheme price of about $40 per tonne were to be used, well there would be no end of carbon abatement offered to Parker.
Next stop: an emissions trading scheme, perhaps like the one John Howard proposed in 2007.
Having backflipped on the NBN and fiscal policy, it'll be easy. Alan Kohler is the editor in chief Eureka Report

LET'S FIND SOME BALANCE IN MANAGING CLIMATE CHANGE

We don't need scare stories and hyperbole but a smart focus on green technology The latest global climate summit in Poland has generated familiar predictions of doom and disaster from environmental activists. Climate change seems to freeze our capacity for critical thinking: we are too eager to believe the problem is far worse than science shows and - conversely - that our solutions are far easier than reality dictates.
Consider weather events: it is second nature now to link these to climate change. Whenever a flood hits, the media blames global warming and warns that floods are increasing. But the most authoritative conclusion by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is that it is not even clear whether floods have increased or decreased globally during the past century.
Both European forest fires and US hurricanes are blamed on global warming. But, despite getting more news attention than normal, forest fires in Europe this year have affected less than half the average area burned; in Europe's southern countries, which contain 90 per cent of the affected forest, the burned area has halved across 35 years. On hurricanes, IPCC scientists say there have been "no significant observed trends" globally during the past century. The frequency of all US land-falling hurricanes has actually been declining since 1900, as has that of major US hurricanes.
The truth about climate change is nuanced: it is real, and in the long term it will be a problem, but its impact is less than we may believe. According to the IPCC's last major report, unrestrained climate change would result in an average reduction in income of about 0.2-2 per cent by the 2070s. That is equivalent to the impact of a single economic recession across the next half-century.
Yet, in a race to the bottom with climate-change deniers, green activists have become hyperbolic. Influential campaigner George Monbiot says "climate change" isn't alarming enough, so should be replaced with "climate breakdown". Climate is not breaking down. In fact, it used to break us down. A century ago, climate disasters killed an average of 500,000 people worldwide every year. Today, despite many more people living in harm's way, the toll has dropped more than 95 per cent.
Just as activists and the media engender fear by associating every fire, flood and hurricane with climate change, they generate a false belief that there are simple solutions to the problem, if only politicians and the public would embrace them.
Take the new argument that becoming vegetarian could fix climate change. The reality is that a Westerner abandoning all meat will cut their greenhouse gas emissions by only a few percentage points.
Or consider the strange suggestion by UN chief Antonio Guterres that climate policies will bring "at least $US26 trillion ($36 trillion) in economic benefits". His claims are based on a glossy report, while the actual (presumably heroic) calculations have never been released. The claim contradicts established climate economics. Replacing fossil fuels with inefficient alternatives slows growth. That's why the 2015 Paris climate agreement, if fully implemented, will cost the planet $1 trillion to $2 trillion annually. Another common refrain is that solar and wind are ready to out-compete fossil fuels. But alternative energy remains reliant on $US160 billion in subsidies annually. When these are withdrawn, investments in solar and wind typically plummet. While there are cases where alternative energies are cheaper than fossil fuels, the reverse is more often true - and solar and wind are infinitely more expensive when the weather is unsuitable.
Globally, solar and wind satisfy less than 1 per cent of our energy needs. The International Energy Agency estimates that by 2040, even if the Paris Agreement holds, this will increase to just above 4 per cent.
If we are to address climate change successfully, we need to listen to William Nordhaus, the first climate economist to win the Nobel prize, who shows that tackling global warming is a question of finding the right balance. With a model refined across decades, Nordhaus demonstrates that a globally co-ordinated, moderate and rising carbon tax could reduce temperatures modestly. It would cost about $US20 trillion to avoid some climate damages, ensuring a net benefit of $US30 trillion across coming centuries.
But without global co-ordination, the policy costs would escalate. And aiming to reduce temperatures more drastically, to within 2.5C of pre-industrial levels, would drive the cost beyond $US130 trillion, leaving us $US50 trillion worse off. Contrast Nordhaus's careful work showing that a 2.5C cap is near impossible with the excitement being whipped up about keeping the rise in global temperature below the much harder 1.5C threshold. At current emissions levels, this would require us to end fossil fuel use in 10 years - an idea that flies in the face of historical evidence. The world has increased emissions constantly across a century, lifting billions out of poverty in the process. We are even told that within a few decades we need to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere on an unprecedented scale, with totally untested technology. That's just wishful thinking. The IEA expects that fossil fuels will still meet three-quarters of global energy demand by 2040.
The technology deficit can be solved only by drastically increasing our spending on research and development of alternative energy. Careful analysis shows that climate change is a problem. But it is not the end of the world. To solve it, we need a smart focus on green-tech innovation, not scare stories and hyperbole.Bjorn Lomborg is director of the Copenhagen Consensus Centre and a visiting professor at the Copenhagen Business School.Copyright Project Syndicate 2018

Media Watch host fans the flames as he dodges climate change facts

The ABC's Media Watch, hosted by Paul Barry, claims the high moral ground, declaring it exposes "conflicts of interest, journalistic deceit, misrepresentation, manipulation and plagiarism". But the problem is that it is full of journalistic deceit, misrepresentation and manipulation itself.
It flouts ABC charter demands for objectivity and accuracy. Rather than be an independent arbiter of media standards, Barry uses it to target the ABC's commercial rivals and wage ideological battles supporting political causes dear to the green left.
The program shows only occasional interest in revealing ABC deceptions and cannot bring itself to examine the organisation's chronic political bias.
Instead, it entrenches them. Media Watch is Barry's vehicle for preaching his climate change-obsessed views and trying to corral journalism within his jaundiced boundaries. Rather than measure reporting against facts, the program weighs journalism it doesn't like against the opinions that dominate the green-left Zeitgeist.
Last week's first program for the year was a classic of the genre because it misrepresented people and facts in order to promote global warming alarmism and denounce News Corp journalism.
Barry's opening line was demonstrably untrue. "Welcome to Groundhog Day," he said, "where the loudest voices at News Corp are adamant that the summer's terrifying bushfires have nothing to do with climate change." Barry and his team must have known it was a lie when putting their program together. For instance, my repeated position on television and in print, based on public scientific and expert documents, was only that activists were grossly exaggerating the role of climate change.
On December 14 in this newspaper I wrote of bushfire and drought that: "The expert analysis shows that if there is a long-term influence from climate change on either of these blights, it will be to make each of them slightly more common in a land where they are common already. Whatever Australia does on carbon emissions can have no impact on any of this, at least for decades to come as global emissions continue to rise." On January 18: "The climate change debate should be part of the discussion but is marginal compared with the central fire management issues and has been ghoulishly fanned as activists exploit real-life trauma for politics â€¦ The science is clear, predicting that in the southeast of the country bad fire conditions will become more common because endemic summer heat and dryness are expected to increase, while regions such as northern NSW may have summer rains delayed more often, as they have been in this drought year. The reason these climate changes should be relatively marginal in the discussion is that they relate to making an existing catastrophic threat slightly more common." Naturally I made many similar comments on TV and radio. Barry also misrepresented my Sky News colleague, Australian Financial Review columnist and Spectator Australia editor Rowan Dean, who says climate policy in Australia could only have a small (1.3 per cent) effect on bushfire intensity.
Barry also created the impression Andrew Bolt, of Sky News and The Herald Sun, had referred to climate science as -"lunatic stuff" when he knew Bolt was referring to climate protesters. This is the sort of misrepresentation that trashes ABC guidelines and journalistic ethics; and Barry and the ABC do this in pursuit of ideological goals.
Media Watch was full of other idiotic comments such as this: "Passionate denial that the bushfires should make us act on climate change runs right across the Murdoch media in this country reaching an audience of millions." Again it is based on a false premise - Barry and the ABC must know Australia is a signatory to the Paris climate agreement and is doing more to reduce emissions than most other nations - and it is also absurd to suggest a bad summer of bushfires should be the sudden catalyst in global warming policy. This is the rhetoric of climate activists, not a serious media watchdog.
Barry referred collectively and offensively to me, Bolt, Dean, Alan Jones, Peta Credlin and Paul Murray as "News Corp's deniers" even though I have never disputed the science of anthropogenic global warming. Others also accept the science and have a variety of nuanced views, and the strongest opponents of climate action, Dean and Jones, are as closely or more closely linked to Nine Media rather than News Corp (guess those facts don't suit Barry's narrative).
Barry said we "all sing from the same song sheet on climate change", when clearly we have differing views (perhaps from the groupthink of the ABC this diversity of views is hard to comprehend). What we do have in common is a thirst for facts, which we inject into the debate. But Barry's critique avoided facts.
Media Watch focused on how some of us challenged and exposed claims made as far back as November that this season's fires were unprecedented.
We did this through diligent attention to verifiable information and historical records.
Barry dismisses these assessments, not based on facts, but based on opinions he prefers.
Some of his preferred opinions were from authoritative voices but they were still just opinions - what matters are facts.
Barry's case to establish a lack of precedent was emotive tosh: "Mass evacuations, homes and businesses destroyed, a billion animals dead, an area 1.5 times the size of Tasmania burnt to ashes, our big cities choking with smoke and fires still raging." He completely dodged the fact that none of this was unprecedented.
I have demonstrated this through sharing of facts and historical records in this newspaper and on Sky News.
Other colleagues have done similar. Media Watch knows this but censors this reality in order to make its malicious, jaundiced and ideological case.
The ABC has not reported these facts. The ABC adopts the sinister approach of censoring these facts to mislead the public, and then has the audacity to build a farrago of lies in order to discredit journalists who research and share the facts. This is not journalism but its evil twin.
Barry gave the game away when he said: "There's no doubt climate change activists across the world think the fires should be a tipping point." Clearly his thesis, his whole show, is not about facts, fairness and reality, it is about distorting reality so he can share the vibe of the climate activists.Media Watch is using the taxes of Australian families against their own interests. And no one at the ABC or in the government has the fibre to intervene.

CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALP BUSINESS, NOT A GREENS SLOGAN

The PM cannot put carbon on the backburner just because her tax is law
THE passage of carbon pricing this month is the end of a bumpy and bruising process.
We might have had a scheme in December 2009 if Kevin Rudd's legislation had not been blocked when the Greens voted with the Coalition in the Senate.
Of course, if John Howard had won a fifth term he would have been bound to implement a promise for an emissions trading scheme based on cap-and-trade. We would have had ``a big bad tax'' under the Coalition.
But enough of the alternative histories. The legislation is in place. And the federal Labor government could be forgiven if it wanted to put the contentious politics behind it. It might be drawn to distance itself from carbon pricing, to dedicate itself to economic management, health, education and industrial relations.
A generation of state Labor premiers and chief ministers held office when changes in climate were first beginning to worry Australians. We don't now want to see the issue become a fifth-order one.
Climate change can't be seen as a nature-conservation issue alone. It can't be left as a slogan for the Greens, who, after all, delayed carbon pricing by two years. In our view, climate should be a core Labor Party concern.
Of course, even if we were inclined to relegate it, circumstances will correct us.
The release on Tuesday of research providing the first snapshot of climate change altering the dynamics of the Southern Ocean has confirmed the more rapid melting of Antarctic ice sheets, the ocean becoming less salty and the waters becoming more acid.
Our focus has been on chemical changes on Earth's upper atmosphere -- overwhelmingly believed by scientists to be caused by human activity and to be the cause, in turn, of global warming.
But this might be overtaken by a new anxiety about the state of our oceans as they struggle to absorb the surplus carbon being pumped out by the world's coal-fired power plants.
Until John Howard, seeking re-election, took up the issue of climate change in 2007 all the action was at the state level.
For example, in 1996 the government I led in NSW introduced the first controls on broad-acre land clearing. Peter Beattie did the same in Queensland in 2007. These actions restrained what had previously been a ``let it rip'' approach to tearing out Australia's native vegetation on farms.
The state-level restraints were responsible for Australia coming close to meeting its Kyoto obligations, even though, until Kevin Rudd became prime minister, we'd never signed the treaty.
NSW launched the NSW Greenhouse Gas Reduction Scheme in January 2003. It was introduced two years before the European scheme and is treated by the World Bank as the world's first carbon trading scheme.
In 2005, as Victorian premier, Steve Bracks hired Ross Garnaut to prepare a cap-and-trade scheme for all the states to sponsor. Victoria then bequeathed its work to the incoming Rudd federal government.
Mike Rann is able to boast that, if South Australia were a country, not a state, it would be second only to Denmark in terms of wind-power generation. Geoff Gallop saved the old-growth forests of Western Australia, huge carbon sinks slated for logging.
As the Labor Party gathers for its national conference, marriage equality and uranium exports make the headlines. But climate change must not be relegated: following through on the legislation must be core for this Labor government.
Great Labor leaders of the past century stood up for workers' rights, public services, economic modernisation and national security. Their names will be invoked in speeches by a party proud of Curtin, Chifley, Whitlam, Hawke and Keating.
In a like spirit, the Labor leaders of this century will need to continue to fight, and fight again, to see a resilient Australia liberate itself from overdependence on destructive fuels and help steer the world that way as well.

Sorting Bangladeshi disasters from the fact or myth of climate change

Rising floodwaters and other evironmental problems cannot be simply blamed on the impact of man-made climate change
CAKED in sweat and slime, Mohamed Abdul Wozad pauses for breath before heaving another basket of river mud on his head, and starting up the slippery path towards the embankment above. A lifetime resident of Gabura Island in southwest Bangladesh, Wozad lives at the battlefront of global climate change, a 28sq km patch of damp earth clasped in the estuarine fingers of Bangladesh's sprawling river network. .
Bangladesh squeezes its roughly 160 million population into an area one-sixth the size of NSW. More than 80 per cent of those people survive on less than $US2 ($2.28) per day; many under constant threat from floods, droughts and cyclones. Together with the Maldives and a few other island states, Bangladesh tops virtually every index of countries most vulnerable to climate change. Experts say Gabura Island and the surrounding areas are the worst affected. In recent years it has been made a poster child by activists, who paint many of the country's problems as the rotten fruit of Western greed.
Under existing UN agreements, Bangladesh expects to receive aid from the developed world to combat climate change, money that will ultimately come from the pockets of Western taxpayers. Already facing a surfeit of environmental crises, Bangladeshi policy makers have been quick to cry against global warming; environmental groups have sought to raise the spectre of climate migration. On the ground, however, the consequences of climate change are often similar to those of development, overpopulation and natural disasters, and it is hard to tell them apart. Many experts acknowledge that fears of climate-driven mass migration are overblown. And it is far from certain that either emissions reductions or more aid will succeed in helping the people most in need.
Recalling the lush rice paddies of his youth, Wozad says, ``There were a lot of crops and the weather was good.'' But when Inquirer visited Gabura in April 2009 the island was a fortress ringed by towering mud walls; rice paddies had ceded to brackish lagoons, and the water table was so close to ground level that just a few centimetres separated solid earth from squelching mire. Wozad and two dozen villagers hewed blocks of dank river sediment to repair fragile embankments. Barely a month later cyclone Aila breached those earth walls, flooding the island, destroying property and livelihoods, forcing most of its 37,000 residents from their homes. Gabura Island remains partially submerged; verdant hues redolent of its fertile past survive only in the women's colourful saris and the minds of the elders.
Atiq Rahman, executive director of the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies in Dhaka and a UN Internal Panel on Climate Change member, identifies six key climate change-related challenges: cyclones, floods, droughts, river and coastal erosion, erratic rainfall and saline incursion into coastal farmland. But Bangladesh is no stranger to natural disasters, and researchers must strive to distinguish evidence of climate change from natural variability in their data.
``Climate change is not causing anything new, but the frequency and intensity are increasing,'' says Ainun Nishat, formerly Bangladesh's representative at the International Union for Conservation of Nature and now vice-chancellor of BRAC University in Dhaka. ``There were massive floods in 1988, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2004 and 2007. Statistically, the 1988 flood was a hundred-year event, but in 1995 and 2000 the water levels were similar [to 1988], and in 2004 they exceeded the 1988 level.''
Bangladeshi scientists say crops are failing in northern parts of the country due to changing weather patterns and, farther south, storms and sea-level rise are destroying property and contaminating arable land with salt. Environmental groups, who blame anthropogenic global warming, argue that if these problems worsen they could trigger catastrophic migration, even though migration experts are sceptical about such claims. In practice, however, it is very difficult to identify the effects of climate change among a welter of other possible causes; far less prove the link between local problems and global emissions.
``It is not yet clear whether these are long-term trends, but our observations on the ground match predictions based on IPCC climate change science, and we are using this as a proxy indicator that climate change is happening in Bangladesh,'' says Mozaharul Alam, research fellow at the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies. ``The major indications of climate change have come in the past 10 to 15 years, but the locals would say they have begun to observe unusual events over the past five to 10 years. If we really want to claim these problems are due to climate change we need more analysis and more longitudinal data.''
What's more, many problems are complicated by developmental factors, such as embankment building that has produced apparent sea-level rise unrelated to climate change.
Before cyclone Aila, Abdul Khalek Mollah lived in a one-room shack close to Gabura's fragile embankment. He had already rebuilt his home twice after storm surges breached the earth walls and described the sound of rushing water entering his house at night as ``the worst experience of my life''. Bangladesh's network of 7000km of coastal embankments was built during the 1960s to protect valuable farmland from flooding. Researchers say it fostered several decades of bumper harvests, but also disrupted sedimentation patterns. Ordinarily, natural subsidence of Bangladesh's delta is compensated by sedimentation during monsoon flooding and at high tide. Embankment building restricted sedimentation to the channels, gradually choking the rivers and raising their level with respect to the surrounding land. Due to this and ongoing subsidence, the land behind Gabura's embankments is now ``a minimum two feet below the river bank and some parts are below sea-level'' according to Mohon Kumar Mondal, executive director of a local non-government organisation called LEDARS.
This figure translates into a relative change of about 15mm a year since the embankments were built, or roughly five times the average rate of global sea-level rise over the same period. Thus, protected areas have become vulnerable to flooding, waterlogging and saline incursions as a direct consequence of the structures built to secure them.
``The embankments have created one of the greatest tragedies in human history: people who once had an agricultural life suddenly have no living, no production,'' Rahman says.
Water-sharing disputes and population pressures have exacerbated Bangladesh's environmental problems, too. Of Bangladesh's 57 major rivers, 54 are shared with India; 92 per cent of Bangladesh's water flows from its neighbours. Bangladesh claims that when India built the Farakka Dam across the Ganges River during the 70s, one of the world's longest barrages, situated about 10 km from the Bangladesh border, it significantly reduced flows in Bangladesh's western rivers. Scientists argue these rivers are no longer able to flush clogged sediment out to sea, making them more vulnerable to flooding and storm surges, and allowing saline water to penetrate farther upstream. Water-sharing negotiations are stalled, and the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, which has been campaigning for more transparency and co-operation with India, has evidence that India plans to withdraw more water soon.
``Although there is a clear international law stating that the upstream country cannot use the river in such a way as to impair the rights of the downstream country, what happens when they don't comply?'' Says Iqbal Kabir, lawyer with the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association.
The adverse effects of embankments, water-sharing disputes and many other factors mean it is difficult to determine what climate change has actually caused.
``The first culprit is the embankments, the second is the Farakka dam diversion, the third is climate change. Who contributes how much? That needs to be studied and looked into, it's not a simple question,'' Nishat says. However, even though Bangladeshi researchers are candid about such problems, environmental groups and Western media reports often ignore them. Indeed, while visiting Gabura, Inquirer encountered a couple on an eight-month $US250,000 global assignment, documenting ``climate change victims'' for an NGO affiliated with former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan and a suite of Left-leaning European publications. The pair interviewed the smart, outspoken chairman of Gabura union, who produced a neat spiel outlining local problems and implicating climate change and the West's malfeasance. But when probed by Inquirer, through a Western-educated local interpreter, about his understanding of the phrase ``climate change'', he said he thought it meant rising river levels due to siltation and flooding of the surrounding mangroves, bringing water inland; he blamed India's Farraka Dam.
Bangladesh's biggest problem is arguably population pressure: there is no more land. ``If we had a population of 40 million instead of 160 million, who cares about climate change?'' Nishat says.
Mahbub Ullah, professor of development studies at the University of Dhaka, says, ``Although we have succeeded in arresting the rate of population growth from around 3 per cent to around 1.4 per cent per annum, I think it's not enough.''
Tapan Kumar Mondal perched on a narrow dike in the village of Harinagar in southwest Bangladesh. Only a metre or so of earth separated his mother's mud shack from the encroaching river; his 80-year-old grandmother's home was already lost to the water, and he and seven relatives shared one tiny house. Tapan had been to India illegally, where he worked in the construction industry. It would be easy but inaccurate to cast him as a harbinger of the wave of climate migrants predicted to leave Bangladesh soon. ``I went there to earn a better living, and that's why I'll go back,'' he says.
Environmental groups and media reports have seized on suggestions that as many as 20 million peoplecould be forced to leave their homes in coming decades. Fortunately, however, leading researchers think mass emigration is unlikely to happen soon, if at all.
``I don't foresee a situation where mass movement of hungry people will take place. Refugees going from one country to another, I don't [fore]see that type of situation,'' says Tasneem Siddiqui, chairman of the Refugee and Migratory Movements Research Unit at the University of Dhaka.
Siddiqui points out that migration has been part of life in Bangladesh for thousands of years. Research has shown that, on average, people move 11 times within their local area before migrating to urban centres; only 3 per cent go overseas.
``It's nothing,'' Siddiqui says. ``We have seen that when storms or cyclones come, people don't want to leave their houses. They leave their houses on the good days because they think they can earn a better living elsewhere,'' says Mahfuz Ullah, secretary general at the Centre for Sustainable Development in Dhaka.
Nevertheless, big international NGOs such as Friends of the Earth and Action Aid continue to raise the spectre of climate migration, which observers suggest could be linked to funding. ``These are real problems, but some of our NGOs earn their livelihoods by making them bigger. That's why we don't come up with rational judgments, we come up with what sells. Everyone is talking about climate change now,'' Siddiqui says.
In the lush surrounds of Sufalakathi village in southwest Bangladesh, village chairman Abdus Samad explains how quick thinking by local farmers began a trial program that could help strengthen Bangladesh's defences against flooding and sea-level rise. The program, known as Tidal River-basin Management, works by temporarily flooding low-lying areas so that the water deposits its sediment, thereby raising the level of the land.
The farmers became frustrated when embankments trapped sediment-laden floodwater in their fields. One night they broke the embankment and, once the fields had drained, found that ground level had risen by up to a metre in places. TRM mimics natural conditions, and could help counteract the negative effects of embankment building, subsidence and water-sharing disputes. According to Nishat, the results of several trials are promising, and there are plans to implement the scheme elsewhere.
Small-scale adaptation methods linked to rural development are at the heart of Bangladesh's strategy to tackle problems it believes are linked to climate change. The country was among the first in the developing world to submit detailed proposals to the UN, and is petitioning the West for funding. Under its Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan, Bangladesh has developed 38 programs aimed at improving food, water and livelihood security for its struggling population. These include plans to develop stress-tolerant rice varieties, improve water supplies and sanitation, strengthen cyclone preparedness and provide infrastructure upgrades. Among the more novel ideas are ``floating gardens'' that rise and fall with the floodwaters. However, like many developing countries, Bangladesh has struggled to implement its ideas in the past, and there is widespread concern that if these programs are not managed better the poor will continue to suffer.
``There is a lot of talk about climate change and natural disasters; there are also policies and programs of disaster management, but on the ground very little happens,'' says Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, chairman of Bangladesh Unnayan Parishad, a multidisciplinary research organisation based in Dhaka.
In southwest Bangladesh, where creeping salinity has affected agricultural productivity, many farmers are switching from rice farming to shrimp cultivation. Although environmental groups claim this as evidence that climate change destroying the traditional way of life, development experts say the change has occurred largely for economic reasons, and has been good for the rural economy.
``Shrimp cultivation has brought more money to the local economy than purely rice-based peasant farming,'' Ullah says.
``Shrimp farming is about economics, not about climate change,'' Nishat says.
Mohamed Monimur Mollah worked 2000sq m of land outside the village of Kolabri, in southwest Bangladesh.
``Since the salinity has increased I have been able to take up shrimp cultivation, which is more profitable than [rice] farming. Now I can give my family a better life,'' he says. ``The point is that the richer you are, the more resilient you are in the economic system,'' Rahman says.
But for the poorest of the poor, there is still a long way to go.
Mohamed Mustafa lived in East Kalinagar, a small village not far from Gabura Island. When Inquirer met him he had just survived his second tiger attack in six years. The tiger jumped into his boat while he was paddling around the Sundarbans mangrove forest, catching fish and collecting anything else he could eat or sell. It is a precarious, hand-to-mouth existence barely changed from that of his hunter-gatherer forefathers. Asked whether he will return to the Sundarbans and risk a third tiger attack, Mustafa replies, ``What choice do I have?''

LABOR HAS MISCUED ON THE POLITICS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

Australia's modern-day politicians would rather make headlines than make history
Labor and the Greens are not going to convince voters that climate change demands a major economic transformation with alarmism and hollow gestures. Nor will the Coalition persuade voters that ambitious emissions reduction targets will decimate our economy. And One Nation's claim that climate change is a grand hoax is beyond parody.
The challenge for policymakers is not just accepting that the warming of the planet has consequences for our economy, environment, health and wellbeing. That should be a given.
The critical test is to develop effective policies that mitigate the impact of climate change and facil-itate the decarbonisation of the economy.
Scott Morrison has correctly identified the best way to deal with climate change is to encourage the development of low-emissions technology that also provides for the security and reliability of energy supply. His government is identifying a technology road map. But where is that road map leading? What is the end goal that provides a clear signal to the market about what they are aiming to achieve?
The goal of net zero emission by 2050 has support nationally and internationally, across business, unions and environmentalists, from progressive and conservative governments. Every Australian state and territory government has signed up. So have 73 countries. How can the Prime Minister argue against this diverse alliance of competing interests? Wisely, Morrison has not ruled out supporting the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. It makes sense to work out a plan to achieve it first. But it will not be tenable for Australia to attend the UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in November without having signed up to this goal - and it is only a goal. Australia would be a laughing stock.
There is nothing ideological in accepting the science of climate change and acting to mitigate it. Boris Johnson, who leads a conservative government in Britain, has embraced the 2050 goal. He is a Green Tory. His government has policies to phase out coal-fired power by 2024 and diesel and petrol vehicles by 2035.
"I hope that we can as a planet, and as a community of nations, get to net zero within decades," Johnson said last month. "Let's make this year the moment when we come together with the courage and the technological ambition to solve man-made climate change and to choose a cleaner and greener future for all our children and grandchildren." This is a remarkable statement.
Anthony Albanese supports the goal of net zero emissions by 2050 to halt the warming of the planet before it is too late. But what is his policy pathway to achieve it? Nothing. Naught. Zilch. Zero. Zip. His argument that the cost of not acting is greater than the cost of acting will not wash with voters. It fails the credibility test.
Labor has misjudged the politics of climate change. While most voters want to reduce emissions, few are willing to pay more for their power bills or sacrifice jobs to achieve it. They want a plan for transitioning the economy. Labor cannot realistically promise that 8000 workers in coal-fired power plants will automatically get new jobs installing solar roof panels or maintaining wind turbines.
Mark Butler, who wanted to end backroom factional deals until he accepted one to remain in parliament, has been bad for Labor. Butler is a climate change zealot. His "climate emergency" motion presented to parliament last year was empty rhetoric. It confirmed fears among working-class voters in rural and regional areas that Labor is not on their side. Butler has not done the hard policy work to show how the economy can transition.
Butler, and other Labor frontbenchers, characterised the election last year as a climate change election. They were wrong about this. Moreover, Labor's ambitious emissions reduction targets were not modelled to identify the impact on the economy. This became a major issue as MPs and candidates had no answer to voter questions about these policies.
The problem is that both Labor and the Coalition lack courage and ambition. Neither the government nor the opposition has done the policy work. This is a chronic failure of modern politics: we lack the leaders who can identify problems, develop a plan to respond to them, articulate why and how this should be done, win public support, and then implement it.
Think about John Curtin and Ben Chifley's postwar immigration scheme; Robert Menzies' trade and commerce agreement with Japan; Harold Holt dismantling the White Australia policy; Gough Whitlam unfreezing relations with China; Bob Hawke and Paul Keating floating the dollar, slashing tariffs and privatising assets; and John Howard's gun laws and introducing the GST.
Achieving net zero emissions within 30 years is not beyond us. Consider the technological changes in the past 30 years: the internet, GPS, iPhones and iPads, texting and emailing, social media, cloud computing and 3D printing. It is impossible to predict the future. But we know the gains from technological innovation - as essentially held in Moore's Law - accelerate across time.
Investment in renewable energy will continue to increase and the cost will decrease. Last year, 25 per cent of electricity came from renewables; it is predicted to grow to 34 per cent by 2023. We need to continue to transition from coal-fired power to wind and solar energy, hydrogen and natural gas, hydro-electricity and introduce nuclear power. Investing in battery storage and making the energy grid more stable and secure is essential.While we should be optimistic about a technology-led decarbonisation of the economy, and businesses are already acting, we need governments to help facilitate this transition. As a wealthy country with high per capita emissions, we can lead the way and reap the economic benefits. But this requires courage and ambition, and detailed policy work. Instead, our politicians are more interested in a favourable headline than in making history.

Heady scenarios emerged from the Paris talks, but harsher realities await
If there has been a meeting of minds in Paris, a common link for the developed and developing world, the communists, big business and the Greens, it is the firm belief that there's a lot of money in climate change.
Like a magic pudding, the climate change response will unleash economic forces to rival the Industrial Revolution, liberate continents from poverty, boost food security and right historical wrongs.
In the nuclear-powered power corridors of the COP21 UN conference, industrial and economic transformation is the dominant narrative that does not lack ambition.
It is a seductive echo chamber where the political lessons of high electricity prices, failed government subsidy programs, reduced energy security and major renewable energy company bankrupt-cies don't seem to cut through the groundswell of good feelings for change.
Trillions of dollars will be marshalled but no one asks if $650 billion a year being promised by US banking institutions will ever be expected to make a profit and, if so, will it need public support to do so.
Government aid budgets have pledged the world's poorest developing nations new energy systems at a cost of billions, but it is impolite to question whether it is value for money and what happens if they don't work.
Old measures to assess the relationship between energy costs, productivity and prosperity have been cast aside in favour of a single matrix, carbon intensity.
US Secretary of State John Kerry sees it as "the most extraordinary market opportunity in the history of humankind".
He is planning nothing short of "the gradual transformation of the global economy".
For Kerry the climate change story is now economic opportunity. "Everything else is gravy," he says.
World Resources Institute president and chief executive Andrew Steer says: "This is all about the implementation of revolution in the making." Economist Nicholas Stern says the biggest risk has been governments removing green energy subsidies too soon. "But if we get this right," Stern says, "this will be something much more powerful than the Industrial Revolution." It is the sort of heady atmosphere that allows Australian Greens leader Richard Di Natale to declare: "There's almost a universal consensus that coal has no long-term future.
"The argument simply is the pace of that transition, how quickly do we move from coal towards renewable energy resources." In Di Natale's mind, at least, that consensus seems to be "very close to being achieved".
The reality check is that China, India and even Germany are still looking to coal for baseload power.
China has approved 155 coal plants with a capacity of 120 gigawatts this year alone.
India has plans to double domestic coal production, and all the long-range forecasts have coal providing the biggest share of electricity for decades to come.
There is another reality check in the heavy going of the Paris climate change talks themselves.
High expectations of a new global unity forged by the pre-COP good wishes of China and the US all proved for naught when it came to the conference negotiations, just as the decision of French organisers to call world leaders together early in the Paris process appears to have made no real difference at all.
As they always do, the UN-backed talks have gone down to the wire with desperate negotiators trying to stop the most anticipated climate meeting in half a decade from becoming forever known as COP FLOP 21.
Stripped of emotion, it had always been a case of how much money was required to encourage India, China and others to surrender a standing agreement that mandates only the developed world is required to take action, and what measures can be implemented to ensure all countries do what they say they will do.
References to limiting global warming to 1.5C are window-dressing but no doubt they will fuel the relentless campaign building steam against fossil fuels and in favour of renewables.
Into the final days and hours, personal pleas from US President Barack Obama to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi were not sufficient to secure a deal that bridged the divide between the developed and developing world.
All night African speaking circles called indabas were held in which the French showed their preparedness to listen.
But any success in Paris ultimately would come down to the twisting of definitions to paper over what remain long-held and seemingly intractable differences.
But if any more proof were needed, the Paris talks have demonstrated again that the UN climate change process is about much more than climate and science.
The reality is that fears about climate change have been harnessed to animate a juggernaut of bureaucratic process on to which has been layered the decades-long disappointments and resentments of developing nations.
For the UN, climate change is the key plank of its newly established sustainable development goals, even though climate change rated poorly in a global vote of key concerns.
"Without addressing climate change properly, immediately we will be in a lot of difficulties implementing the remaining 16 development goals," UN secretary-general Ban Ki Moon told the Paris conference.
"If we really want to put an end to global poverty, if we really want to make this world healthier and planet Earth environmentally sustainable, we have to first address this climate change issue." African nations still see the climate change talks as a vehicle through which to secure compensation for decades of exploitation and lost opportunity.
For small island states in the Pacific and Indian Ocean, climate change is considered an existential threat.
Their pleas have been taken up by most countries at the Paris conference, a so-called high ambition group, which includes the US and appears to have been successful in having a reference to a 1.5C warming target in the Paris text.
For China, climate change is a strategic issue of balancing global responsibility with the domestic pressures of pollution, poverty eradication and future development For India, it remains an inconvenience to economic growth for which it accepts no responsibility, And for the US it is a matter of a presidential legacy that increasingly is being sold on the basis of business opportunity.
Kerry laid out the paradigm shift in Paris.
He resisted an earlier narrative that climate change could explain in part the security issues of the Middle East.
These, Kerry said, were primarily the result of bad governance and corruption. "The fruit vendor in Tunisia who ignited the Arab Spring self-immolated because a policeman slapped him around because he had to pay his bribe, and he got fed up and said, 'I'm not going to pay my bribe.' And he went to the police station to protest and lit himself on fire," the US Secretary of State said.
"That is what ignited the Arab Spring, the Tunisian Spring it started with and the departure of (Tunisian president Zine el Abidine) Ben Ali, and then moving to Egypt and elsewhere and throughout the world." But Kerry was unambiguous about the economic opportunity that now faced the US. "This is the most extraordinary market opportunity in the history of humankind," Kerry said.
"This is already a four to five billion user market and valued at multiple trillions of dollars, and we're going to spend at least 17 trillion in the next 10 years on new energy projects." Kerry said it would be a "business-driven transformation".
"I am convinced that the combination of American ingenuity and our allocation of capital are going to combine to help America to be able to lead the world to a better economy," he said.
"And I think there are million of jobs to be created in this - the people who will build and service and profit by this transformation." As negotiations reached their endgame in Paris, business groups were largely optimistic at what they saw.
Virgin boss Richard Branson said a strong agreement would "increase the confidence of business and investors, helping to drive innovation, increase clean energy investments, expand research and development into climate-neutral technologies and spur an era of green economic growth and job creation." Post-Paris, with a likely 1.5C aspirational target, it must be whether the substance can really match the rhetoric.
Whatever the outcome, the fundamental truths remain.
Breakthroughs are needed in the cost and performance of renewable energy technologies.
And the biggest sticking point issue of differentiation between developed and developing nations will have to be resolved.
As Kerry outlined in Paris, the maths make it inevitable.
If all the industrialised nations of the world cut their greenhouse gas emissions to zero it wouldn't be enough when 65 per cent of the world's carbon emissions come from the developing world.
"No matter how much half the world does to clean up its act, if similar steps aren't taken by the rest of the world, Earth still has a problem," Kerry said.

Cold facts reveal our hot climate-change

TINY air bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice show there are more climate-changing greenhouse gases in today's atmosphere than at any time in the past 650,000 years.
The finding -- which comes in the run-up to next week's major climate conference in Canada -- is strong evidence that humans have changed the climate more in the past 200 years than nature did over millennia.
"We are out of the natural range," declared team leader Thomas Stocker of the University of Bern in Switzerland.
MATP
The evidence, reported today in the journal Science, comes from a 30m ice core drilled at Dome Concordia in east Antarctica by the European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica.
The core is a frozen record of the annual accumulation of snow deposits and as a result the atmospheric gas concentrations.
It extends the time covered by the previous ice core record by nearly 50per cent, and encompasses six glacial-interglacial cycles.
In a second Science paper, Professor Stocker and his colleagues reported that the concentrations of two additional greenhouse gases, methane and nitrous oxide, mirrored those of carbon dioxide.
Melbourne-based David Etheridge, an expert on ancient climate with CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research, said that taken together, the findings were compelling evidence of human involvement in climate change.
"There is no doubt that greenhouse gases are increasing beyond the range we've seen in the core record and probably much longer," he said.
Dr Etheridge said there was no doubt people were responsible for the build-up of greenhouse gases: "That's a given."
In the past five years, the average global temperature had risen by 0.2C -- 100 times higher than normal for such a period.
Greenhouse sceptics argue that human activities like the burning of fossil fuels are not driving climate change. They claim natural processes -- such as changes in the amount of sunlight and volcanic eruptions spewing carbon dioxide into the air -- have caused similar changes in the geological past.
But Oregon State University geoscientist Edward Brook, says the new results scuttle that argument.

STOKING FEAR A FOOL'S GAME FOR MEDIA PROMOTING PANIC OVER CLIMATE CHANGE

Once-sober media organisations that distinguished themselves from racy tabloid television and newspapers now prefer panic to accurate and sceptical reporting.
Sceptical is not a popular word among young, activist journalists who should have been social workers. But it was a quality that news editors, sub-editors and executive producers used to bring to the craft. Now it's the reverse at what were once considered up-market publishers such as the old Fairfax papers and the ABC.
Panic is most obvious in reporting about climate change, where our ABC never misses an opportunity to publish wild claims no serious scientist believes. But the bias towards panic is ubiquitous: it was obvious at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic when claims of 150,000 dead here and emergency ICU wards overflowing within weeks were pumped out across the Fairfax papers and the ABC.
The trend towards "panic journalism" follows the empowerment of young reporters who have seen little of life and are no longer protected by editing processes that have been cut to save money. This column has argued publishers embrace this collapse in standards because they see it as a marketing tool in a fragmented media landscape. People who are disposed to moral panic about race, climate or capitalism love to consume media that confirms their bias. But it is a fool's game. Mainstream media is just surrendering its trust advantage to social media extremism. The facts will eventually become clear, and there are early signs this is beginning to happen.
While journalists who bother to read scientific reports for themselves always knew much of the reporting at left-wing media was wildly exaggerated, even some climate activists are now seeing through the lies of Extinction Rebellion, the linking of CO2 emissions to individual bushfire and storm events and other claims not supported by science.
The propagandist filmmaker Michael Moore kicked this off with a film showing the downside of renewables - Planet of the Humans. The film would have been largely unnoticed but for demands by warming zealots that it be banned. People decided to watch it for themselves.
The film shows pretty much what this newspaper has been saying, correctly, for two decades. Renewables do not provide reliable baseload power. They are expensive and only viable with government subsidy. And they are beloved by rich bankers because they provide high taxpayer-subsidised rates of return.
As this paper revealed at the time of the launch of hybrid cars in Australia, even motor vehicle renewable technologies have enormous carbon footprints in their manufacturing, in mining for the rare metals they rely on and in the case of electric cars in the baseload power they need to recharge. They are a con. Environment writers at Fairfax, the Guardian and the ABC won't call the facts out.
Last week readers of this newspaper were told about a new book by US environmental activist Michael Shellenberger, Apocalypse Never: Why Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All. Shellenberger admits he was part of a movement that knew it was grossly exaggerating the facts, and much of what he tells readers has been reported by this newspaper for 20 years.
For him, the scaring of children around the world with false facts was too much. Yet when this column and other journalists at News Corp papers have told the truth about the RCP8.5 scenario used to justify false claims of a 2030 climate emergency they have been either ignored or ridiculed in the left media, most prominently by ABC Media Watch host Paul Barry.
As this column has explained before, RCP8.5 is not a serious scenario but the top-end outlier of four different IPCC scenarios. It is not where the IPCC says the world is tracking. It assumes coal use will increase by almost 400 per cent by 2070 and no nuclear, renewable or gas power generation will be brought on stream to mitigate emissions. It is at odds with the facts already.
Australians are less familiar with another climate panic defection. Zion Lights, the 34-year-old former spokeswoman for the UK Extinction Rebellion group so beloved by Guardian Australia, was so appalled by the movement's misleading approach to science she quit late last month to become a lobbyist for nuclear energy. After reading up on the benefits of zero emissions nuclear power she said: "The facts don't really change, but once I understood them I did change my mind." Journalism's litany of environmental lies extends far beyond bogus extinction stories, the failure to analyse renewable power accurately, blind hatred of fossil fuels and childish enthusiasm for hybrid cars. Dozens of false claims about the state of planet Earth have been run, but not corrected when they prove false.
Some truths not in Shellenberger's piece here last week: " The Guardian reported to enormous publicity in 2010 the Greenland ice sheet was melting and global sea levels could rise by 7m. Since then Greenland's temperatures have returned to 1930s levels and Greenland's glaciers stopped retreating seven years ago. Not much reporting of that.
" As this column said last year, most of the world's coral islands, especially those of the South Pacific, are not sinking, according to research from the University of Auckland. Now a new study led by the University of Plymouth and reported in Science Advances shows wave action on reefs off such islands actually builds up sediment levels and helps to raise island surfaces.
" A new paper in the journal Science, "The internal origin of the east-west asymmetry of Antarctic climate change", suggests "the current asymmetry of Antarctic surface climate change is undoubtedly of natural origin because no external factors (eg orbital or anthropogenic factors) contribute to the asymmetric mode". Data from historic samples suggests climate fluctuations in the tropics such as El Nino and the Southern Oscillation Index are a factor in different rates of warming.
" Despite years of credulous media claims that India and China are moving away from fossil fuel, the opposite is true. Last month Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India, with the fourth largest coal reserves in the world, was launching commercial auctions to unlock coal reserves from "years of lockdown". Bloomberg analyst Michelle Leung said she expected China's next five-year plan to target 1300 gigawatts of coal capacity, up from 1050 today. China is also expanding construction of coal-fired power plants. After adding 29.9gW last year Bloomberg said construction already under way in May would account for an extra 46gW. But every ABC business journalist I ever hear insists coal is a "stranded asset". Shellenberger attributes climate panic to Malthusian fear. Thomas Malthus wrote in the 18th century that food production would not keep pace with population growth. He did not foresee population rises would slow as societies got richer and failed to account for human improvement in agricultural production. Fear in the face of difficult problems is easier for the media to sell than understanding.

THE NEW CLIMATE CHANGE BATTLEFRONT Pause for a message: figures don't add up

The planet may be much less sensitive to higher levels of carbon dioxide than predicted
SCIENCE, like climate, can take a long time to change direction. When Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change chairman Rajendra Pachauri first acknowledged to this newspaper in February last year the existence of a pause in global surface temperatures of more than a decade, his comments were met with incredulity.
But as the political and diplomatic world strives to deliver meaningful action on climate change, momentum is building behind the controversial view that the numbers don't add up.
A rising chorus of literature in the world's best scientific journals and most prestigious opinion pages has argued the climate change math is flawed. Like a freight train that has left the station, questions about an 18-year "hiatus" in global average surface temperatures and the location of "missing" heat from the climate system are building a head of steam.
For climate scientists, irritating questions from "sceptics" about the "pause" have now become peer-reviewed papers that suggest the Earth's climate may be much less sensitive to higher levels of carbon dioxide than predicted.
Michael Asten, from the school of earth atmosphere and environment at Monash University, says there have been 15 articles commenting on and analysing the pause, or hiatus, published by the top journal group Nature in the past two years.
"While opinions on causes differ, existence of the pause is settled; only activists dare claim the pause in global temperature does not exist," Asten says.
For scientists such as Matthew England, from University of NSW Climate Change Research Centre, the "missing heat" will reappear with a vengeance. But it is unclear when this will happen.
There is no dispute that the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is rising, that human actions are contributing to the rise and, all things being equal, this will have an impact on the Earth's climate.
But while the IPCC says it is more certain than ever that humans are causing climate change, the gap between what climate models have predicted should happen and what is being observed is growing.
Clearly, in nature, all things are not equal and the uncertainties of scientific understanding continue to be great. This week, fresh science has shed new light on how plants use more CO2 than previously thought. We now know plankton growth in the Arctic Ocean accelerates with increasing UV light, locking up more carbon. Complex processes are layered over complex systems that occur across timeframes longer than scientists have been able to physically measure them.
Key questions remain about the impact of clouds and ocean cycles and the true level of climate sensitivity to CO2.
It is a crucial time for science.
Garth Paltridge, former chief research scientist with the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research and chief executive of the Antarctic Co-operative Research Centre, fears the rise of "postmodern" science. In the world of postmodern science, he says, results are valid only in the context of society's beliefs, and where the very existence of scientific truth can be denied.
"Postmodern science envisages a sort of political nirvana in which scientific theory and results can be consciously and legitimately man-ipulated to suit either the dictates of political correctness or the politics of the government of the day," Paltridge says.
At this point, Australian -governments and their climate agencies are standing firmly behind the IPCC. But respected US climate scientist Judith Curry agrees with Paltridge. Curry is a professor and former chairwoman of the School of Earth and Atmospheric -Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology. She has served on the NASA Advisory Council Earth Science Subcommittee, National Academies Climate Research Committee and the Space Studies Board, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Working Group.
Curry has been a strong voice in the climate change debate internationally and is at the centre of new research that questions -climate sensitivity. She argues the sensitivity of the climate to increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide is a central question in the debate on the appropriate policy response to -increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
In the US, she says, a climate policy dialogue is starting to open up, with discussion of the 2C threshold, lower sensitivity and the hiatus.
Climate sensitivity is defined as the global surface warming that occurs when the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles. High sensitivity will lead to substantial warming as atmospheric CO2 continues to increase. If climate sensitivity is low, Curry says, future warming will be substantially lower and it may be several generations before average temperatures move past the 2C limit set for dangerous warming.
According to the IPCC's latest report, the actual change in 70 years if the level of CO2 in the -atmosphere doubles - known as the transient climate response - is likely to be in the range of 1C to 2.5C. Curry says most climate models have transient climate -response values exceeding 1.8C. The IPCC report notes, however, there is a substantial discrepancy between recent observation-based estimates of climate sensitivity and estimates from -climate -models.
In Curry's calculation, the best estimate for transient climate response is 1.33C with a likely range of 1.05C to 1.80C. Her observation-based energy-balance approach calculations use the same data as the IPCC's latest report for the -effects on the Earth's energy balance of changes in greenhouse gases, aerosols and other drivers of climate change.
The Curry paper also estimates what the long-term warming from a doubling of carbon dioxide -concentrations will be, once the deep ocean has warmed up.
"Our estimates of sensitivity, both over a 70-year timeframe and long term, are far lower than the average values of sensitivity determined from global climate models that are used for warming projections," Curry says.
"Also, our ranges are narrower, with far lower upper limits than reported by the IPCC's latest report. Even our upper limits lie below the average values of climate models." Curry says more than a dozen other observation-based studies have found climate -sensitivity values lower than those determined using global climate models, including recent papers in prestigious climate journals.
She says the new climate sensitivity estimates add to the growing evidence that climate models are running "too hot".
"Moreover, the estimates in these empirical studies are being borne out by the much-discussed 'pause' or 'hiatus' in global warming - the period since 1998 during which global average surface temperatures have not significantly increased," she says.
The pause in warming is at odds with the 2007 IPCC report, which expected warming to increase at a rate of 0.2C per decade in the early 21st century.
Curry says the warming -hiatus, combined with assessments that the climate-model -sensitivities are too high, raises -serious questions as to whether the climate-model projections of 21st-century temperatures are fit for making public policy decisions.
Inquirer put a series of questions to Australia's high-profile -climate change bodies asking them to comment on Curry's research on climate sensitivity, the hiatus in global surface temperatures and model predictions.
Former climate commissioners Will Steffen and Tim Flannery were unavailable to answer but Climate Council chief executive Amanda McKenzie says "vested interests have been using the 'so-called pause' to spread doubt and misinformation".
"The Earth continues to warm strongly," she says. "Since 1998 human activities have introduced two billion Hiroshima bombs' worth of heat into the -atmosphere." David Karoly, from the school of earth sciences at the University of Melbourne, says "the 18-year period 1996 to 2013 has a warming trend in global average surface temperature that is not significantly different than the long-term warming trend 1950 to 2012".
"It is slightly smaller in magnitude than the long-term warming trend, but that difference is not statistically significant," Karoly says. He says the reduction in the rate of surface warming for the recent 15 years demonstrates that natural internal variability of the climate system is very important and that exchanges of heat between the surface and the deeper ocean are very important.
Karoly says he -believes "some climate models underestimate â€¦ and some models overestimate the global climate sensitivity".
"The most plausible explan-ation is natural decadal variability of the climate system." Responses from Australia's key science organisations show they remain in lock-step with the IPCC and their advice is accepted by Environment Minister, Greg Hunt.
Helen Cleugh, science director at CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere Flagship, says measurements do show that the rate at which global mean surface temperature has warmed in the past decade is less than the previous decade. However, while the rate of increase is lower, the temperatures are not lower, she says.
Measurements across the oceans and Earth system as a whole show that warming has continued unabated. "A reduction in the rate of warming (not a pause) is a result of short-term natural variability, ocean absorption of heat from the atmosphere, volcanic eruptions, a downward phase of the 11-year solar cycle, and other impacts over a short time period," Cleugh says.
After taking advice from the Bureau of Meteorology, Hunt tells Inquirer the warming of the climate system is "unequivocal".
"The climate system, which -includes the atmosphere, oceans, land and ice has continued to -accumulate heat over the last 18 years," Hunt says. Although there has been a slower rate of atmospheric warming during the past 18 years, this does not undermine the fundamental physics of global warming, the scientific basis of climate models or the estimates of climate sensitivity.
However, he says he is "exceptionally interested" in the latest reports that there may be even greater capacity for plants and soil to absorb carbon. "While this will be the subject of significant global research over coming years, it underscores the importance of protecting the great rainforests of the world and helping to revegetate our landscapes," he says.
Greens leader Christine Milne says she does not accept the pause. "There has been a slowdown in the speed of the rise but global surface temperatures have still continued to climb," Milne says. "There are strong indications through observations and models that the ocean is absorbing more of the heat than it has in the recent past." In Britain, the Met Office has acknowledged the pause and debate about its significance.
"Global mean surface temperatures rose rapidly from the 1970s but have been relatively flat over the most recent 15 years to 2013," the Met says. "This has prompted speculation that human induced global warming is no longer happening, or at least will be much smaller than predicted.
"Others maintain that this is a temporary pause and that temperatures will again rise at rates seen previously," the Met says.
But the Met Office says research shows the recent pause in global surface temperature rise does not materially alter the risks of substantial warming of the Earth by the end of this century.
"Nor does it invalidate the fundamental physics of global warming, the scientific bases of climate models and their estimates of climate sensitivity," the Met says.
Australia's Bureau of Meteorology says the rate of warming in global surface temperature during the past century has not been uniform, with some decades warming more rapidly than others.
"This is a consequence of variations in heat exchange between the atmosphere and the oceans, and other decade-to-decade changes like variations in solar forcing and the solar dimming -effects of pollution and volcanic eruptions," BoM says.
"The pattern that results is one of steady warming of the oceans, accompanied by alternating periods of fast and slow rises in air temperature." There is dispute over whether increased ocean heat can fully explain the absence of surface warming during the past 18 years. Recent papers have claimed greater deep ocean heat in the north Pacific, Atlantic and -Southern Ocean to explain the "missing" heat.
According to Curry, the bottom line is that uncertainties in ocean heat content are very large, and "there is no particularly convincing evidence that the "missing heat" is hiding in the ocean.
Asten, at Monash, says the -hiatus demonstrates a disconnect between climate models up to 2013 (the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report) and physical measurements on our "laboratory Earth".
There are multiple possible -explanations for the disconnect, he says. UNSW's England and co-workers have proposed a mechanism of transport of heat on a warming Earth from the ocean surface into the deep ocean via changes in the interaction of trade winds and ocean currents.
Gerald Meehl and colleagues at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Colorado have shown from climate models that a -mechanism may exist whereby in El Nino conditions a greater proportion of global heat is stored in oceans below 300m, whereas in La Nina conditions that greater proportion is stored in the upper ocean, although tuning climate models to replicate this process has had only limited success.
William Llovel and co-workers at the California Institute of Technology, in a study published two weeks ago, shows with quantitative observations on global ocean mass and temperature profiles that the deep ocean has cooled slightly, not warmed, in the past decade, and thus the explanation of heat transfer from a warming Earth surface into deep oceans becomes less credible.
"The three studies represent careful studies using conventional assumptions relating to climate sensitivity, addressing the question 'where has the heat in a warming earth gone?' " Asten says.
"An alternative approach which I predict will come, although not without opposition from 'consensus scientists', is to postulate that the 'missing heat' was never here; that is, a reduced climate sensitivity will be estim-ated for the Earth, at or below the low end of the range currently published by the IPCC." Asten says the trend of climate sensitivity estimates made across the past six years from meteorological, satellite and ocean sediment records has been, with very few exceptions, to produce estimates at or below the low end of the range published by the IPCC.
He says low values of climate sensitivity will still affect global temperatures as CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere rise, but increases in temperature may be of similar magnitude to naturally driven temperature cycles, a scenario that has strong implications for how we manage causes and consequences of climate change.
Paltridge says that the prospect of "missing heat" being located in the oceans is a double-edged sword.
"We are being told that some internal oceanic fluctuation may have reduced the upward trend in global temperature," he says.
"It is therefore more than a little strange that we are not hearing from the IPCC that some natural internal fluctuation of the system may have given rise to most of the earlier upward trend.
"In light of all this, we have at least to consider the possibility that the scientific establishment behind the global warming issue has been drawn into the trap of seri-ously overstating the climate problem in its effort to promote the cause."It is a particularly nasty trap in the context of science because it risks destroying, perhaps for centuries to come, the unique and hard-won reputation for honesty which is the basis of society's respect for scientific endeavour."

Crafting a contingency plan on climate change

We must plan for the scale of disasters that could occur if global warming continues, writes Anthony Bergin
WITH experts predicting hundreds of thousands of homes likely to face inundation as a result of climate change during the next 30 years, the Rudd Government is organising a national summit on the risk to the coastal zone.
But it's not just the implications of rising sea levels for town planning that we should focus on.
Climate change will have a direct influence on the type, scale and frequency of disasters, emergencies and incidents Australia will face, including increased flooding, and more frequent and intense storms, lightning events and bushfires. The economic consequences will be severe: the costs of the recent flooding in NSW and Queensland is expected to top $1 billion.
So-called freak weather is becoming more common. Indeed, warnings of these effects on a city such as Mackay, in north Queensland, were given in a public report more than seven years ago by Geoscience Australia, which outlined the extensive community risks and the planning necessary to deal with the problems being experienced there.
Our emergency services and police will confront an increased frequency and volume of emergency calls. We will see the need for greater urban search and rescue efforts, with building and structural collapses caused by coastal erosion. This will have implications for the quantity and type of emergency response equipment needed.
Furthermore, there will be significant evacuation and relocation of large numbers of people: we need to start planning for a Hurricane Katrina-level disaster.
Emergency crews will confront more injuries due to the increased intensity of extreme events. The psycho-social costs will be ongoing; in the months after Cyclone Larry devasted the far north of the state, more than 300 Queensland children suffered post-traumatic stress.
Rescue resources will be stretched with an increased number of simultaneous disaster relief missions. We may witness more antisocial behaviour such as the looting that occurred in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and the recent Queensland floods. While looting during crises is most often needs-based, such behaviour will place more demands on police to maintain security. Just as our police conduct counter-terrorism drills, law enforcement agencies will need to undertake more weather exercises with local emergency services.
There will be implications for our fighting forces, too. As climate-induced disaster relief missions become more frequent and demanding, there will be a growing need for military equipment relevant to these activities or civil equipment that must be moved by our armed forces, such as construction, sanitation, fuel, pharmaceutical supplies and power generation.
We need to debunk the myth that the Australian Defence Force will always be ready and able to assist for a sustainable period. Most of the resources of our armed forces are committed to operational activities. If they are in Australia, they are strategically located in the northeast and west of the country, so when and if they can be released there are vast distances and large logistic challenges.
It would be timely for the new defence white paper, which has been commissioned by Defence Minister Joel Fitzgibbon, to consider if disaster response by our military ought to be regarded as core business, along with its war-fighting role. The Rudd Government has proposed to establish a new centre to focus on improving our military co-ordination with civil agencies on international missions. This body should look at developing a whole-of-nation capability for operations at home.
We will need to step up our efforts in warning and educating the public about extreme weather events and disasters. In the worst-case scenarios, we may be faced with mass casualties resulting from floods, storms or heat waves. The importance of investment in simple community-based risk-management planning is essential. Governments will need to climate-proof their infrastructure as they face these emergencies.
We need to investigate ways in which the resources of the private sector can be integrated into government emergency management arrangements at all levels to assist in the provision of community needs in the initial response and to create an additional surge capacity. We should analyse the regulatory and legislative framework within which emergency management services are provided to identify any impediments to developing public and business management partnerships. Emergency services need to engage the large operators, such as the Coles Group, Woolworths, Bunnings, Linfox, Westfield and similar-size providers of goods and services to the community.
The public should not just rely on government and voluntary groups in the face of disasters. In fact, it's communities and police that will be the critical first respondents in providing shelter and food for those stranded in disaster areas.
In the face of climate change-induced disasters we will have to improve our cross-jurisictional response that involves disaster planning, emergency services, health care and infrastructure providers. Effective strategies will require greater co-ordination and co-operation at the local, regional, state and national levels.
In building a more resilient Australia, we should recognise that a lot of our response and recovery effort is reliant on volunteers. How we nurture and maintain this work force will be a substantial challenge. The overall cost if we had to fully fund our emergency management volunteer effort -- if we had to pay the volunteers, including overheads -- is in the order of $12 billion a year. The average age of volunteers is 47. Few members of Australia's ethnic communities are joining. We need some clever ideas to attract, retain, recognise and protect these people to maintain Australia's world standard in volunteer effort.

Farmers urge new deal in fight against climate change

FARMERS want the Exceptional Circumstances drought relief system scrapped and replaced with new grants and HECS-style loans to farmers to help them adjust to climate change.
In a clear signal of a shift in the rural sector towards an acceptance that the Rudd Government is about to remake drought policy, the National Farmers Federation has declared as inappropriate the existing EC drought relief system.
It wants the EC system's welfare-style payments and interest rate subsidies replaced with innovation grants and loans and an end to open-ended income support.
The call comes in the NFF's submission to a Productivity Commission inquiry into drought relief, which has also heard from the Environment Department that EC payments can encourage land practices harmful to biodiversity.
During last year's election campaign, Kevin Rudd promised grants to help farmers to adapt to climate change as well as more money for research into changing agricultural practices.
And an expert panel examining the social effects of drought last week called for an end to no-strings drought aid, arguing farmers should have a responsibility to attempt to drought-proof properties before they qualify for future taxpayer-funded assistance.
The Productivity Commission inquiry, due to release a draft report soon, has received 109 submissions, many from agricultural groups accepting the need for change and describing the EC arrangements as too complex.
The NFF submission says that in a changing climate, drought assistance triggered by exceptional circumstances is ``no longer appropriate''.
It says farmers contemplating drought should be offered a choice of three strands of government policy: innovation, growth and security of a minimum cashflow.
Those prepared to innovate should be given access to grants and professional advice, as well as help to establish tax-linked management tools allowing them to set aside money in good years for bad years.
The submission says farmers who lack the confidence to innovate, such as those just starting out, should be offered help to grow their businesses using HECS-style loans that would be repaid when their incomes reached a certain level.
After their businesses became more sustainable, they would be offered innovation grants.
In the third stream of assistance, farmers would be given time-limited household income support to allow them to consider their positions or await better times.
They would be offered professional advice on ways to make their operations sustainable and, if they chose to leave the land, taxpayer-funded exit grants.
``The combination of three drought streams is structured to provide genuine incentives for primary producers to invest in preparedness,'' the NFF submission says.
``It aims to create a culture where preparedness and climate risk management is factored into farm business planning on a regular basis and farmers use primarily their own money to manage this risk.''
The Environment Department's submission to the Productivity Commission warns that the existing EC system's payments to

farmers to press on despite drought could have the ``perverse'' consequence of encouraging unsustainable land management practices that could destroy biodiversity.
``During periods of drought, land use and human pressure on natural resources may exacerbate or irretrievably damage biodiversity,'' the department says.
``The immediacy of focusing on drought impacts may also prevent adequate planning and adaptation for the long-term impacts of climate change on the natural environment.''
The submission said drought policy must take into account the wellbeing of the environment.

Middle class still not sold on climate change

``I CAN'T for the life of me see why we should be paying for something that won't make a jot of difference.
``India, China, Brazil, Indonesia. They won't contribute. So we go first. I just can't see why.''
Small businessman Peter Verey owns a children's shoe store in Ringwood, an outer eastern Melbourne suburb in the middle of the federal seat of Deakin, which was pinched by Labor at last year's poll after 23 years in Coalition hands. The margin is small, just 1.4 per cent.
At 66, Verey has owned the business for 33 years, taking over from his father, who opened the store in 1954. Each January, through oil shocks, economic booms and recessions we had to have, children have been dragged in from the holidays for black school shoes to start the year. They sit on the train in the middle of the store to be fitted.
``I don't quite understand how it's all supposed to work, this reduction target and the trading system. I am worried it will put a cost on things that will flow right through my business -- power, materials,'' he says. A day speaking to Verey and others in the shops, streets and malls of Deakin reveals a great deal about Kevin Rudd's chances of selling his climate change policy beyond the younger cohort and into middle Australia.
It quickly becomes clear people pick up on the simple messages but switch off when they hear politicians and experts using acronyms and assuming knowledge. Most -- not all -- accept human activity is changing the climate. And most see it as the Government's role to find a way forward. They accept the need for action, but how much financial pain they are prepared to bear is the political judgment Rudd is banking on getting right.
Seats like Deakin are on a knife edge. And some worry about Rudd being forced to deal with the Greens, whose climate policies they feel are too extreme.
Another recurring theme is the concern that by committing Australia to reduction targets now, we are out on a limb, acting when other countries aren't. That simple message has gained much traction in an issue overloaded with complexity.
Jillian Wright and her daughter Libby are typical of the shoppers rushing around with Christmas lists crumpled in their hands. They have popped into Neco in the neighbouring suburb of Blackburn looking for gift ideas. Neco offers environmentally friendly stock from rain tanks to shower heads to light globes.
Wright, 54, says the green message has well and truly hit home in their household. ``We turn off the lights now when we might have left them on before. We are careful about water and are considering a rain tank. We've got a timer for the shower. We've changed all our light bulbs over,'' she says. But like about 85per cent of the households in Victoria, her household hasn't switched to green power.
``I'm not convinced it will make a difference, and I get cross with people ringing me all the time asking me to change electricity providers to take it up.''
And while she's happy Rudd ratified the Kyoto Protocol on climate change earlier in the year, she says she worries ``it might just be a propaganda exercise''.
``China, Russia, India, they haven't made any commitment. We're just a drop in the ocean compared to them. I also don't think you get the whole story on global warming. You only get the front cover,'' she says.
``For instance, the biggest carbon emission item in a house is the hot water, but no one seems to talk very much about that.''
Further along the road at Coles, the queues are long. Watching for a while, it's apparent how strongly the recycling message has resonated across the demographic spectrum. A brief count puts the green bag:plastic bag ratio at about 60:40, with older women the most consistent users. Simple message -- plastic bags last forever and choke dolphins. Simple solution. Strong response. If only climate change were so black and white.
Health sector auditor Kerry Duckworth, 33, and her mother Neri Norman, 66, plonk down at a food court table outside Coles so Duckworth can feed her baby.
Duckworth knows the Government has set a 5 per cent carbon reduction target for 2020 regardless of action by other countries, and says it's a worthy aspiration, and certainly not too soft.

CSIRO's climate change ignites a storm

The national science agency has been accused of walking away from climate science after it announced it would refocus from trying to understand it to practical measures to deal with it.
CSIRO chief executive Larry Marshall said yesterday climate change had been well modelled and it was time to start doing something about it.
Dr Marshall, a Sydney-born physicist and Silicon Valley entrepreneur, has ordered a restructure that will put 350 jobs at risk, particularly in environmental research, as the agency pursues "moonshots" capable of delivering practical solutions.
The move has triggered outrage among top scientists in Australia and overseas. University of Melbourne earth scientist Kevin Walsh said: "It is incorrect to say that the climate change science problem is solved, and now all we need to do is figure out what to do about it.
"No working climate scientist believes that." Former chief scientist Penny Sackett said she was "stunned" by the move. "The big question which underlies all climate adaptation work is: how is the climate changing?" she said.
"How can our largest national research organisation choose not to engage in finding the answer to that question?" Dr Marshall, who returned to Australia after 25 years to take up the role of CSIRO chief in 2014, said climate modelling was important. "But with finite resources we can't do everything," he added.
"We've either got to focus on measuring it or mitigating it. Many universities have now gone into the climate measurement and modelling area. Some years ago we handed over our climate models to universities and the Bureau of Meteorology. If we were absolutely unique in this area, that would be a different story, but where we can be unique is in figuring out solutions." Dr Marshall's appointment to the CSIRO added to signals that the federal government expected more commercial bang for its research buck - a message the government recently underlined by appointing former Telstra chief executive David Thodey as CSIRO chairman.
Peter Tangney, a science -policy lecturer at Flinders University, said political influence might have triggered CSIRO's latest move, but a longstanding emphasis on "the production of more and better climate change science" had delivered little return.
"This information is often just too complex, not user-friendly or produced at temporal and geographic scales that are not particularly helpful or precise," he said. "The modelling is unlikely to unearth anything profoundly more useful than what we already know about future climate change - although it may be a hard pill to swallow for the climate scientists in (CSIRO's) ranks." The restructure comes after a tumultuous time for the agency, with successive funding cuts forcing it to jettison one-fifth of its staff in two years. Dr Marshall stressed that the latest changes would not involve cuts.
While up to 175 jobs are threatened for each of the next two years, he said many staff would take up new positions within CSIRO.
"Overall, our head count may go up slightly but it won't go down," Dr Marshall said.
CSIRO Staff Association secretary Sam Popovski said staff would find such assurances difficult to trust. "One in five jobs have been lost based on things like federal budgets," he said. "There's not a lot of confidence that we'll have no staffing changes." Mr Popovski said there was a "live debate" within CSIRO about where its climate priorities should lie, as the organisation ramped up its big data capabilities. "The data is not at an endpoint that you can simply reanalyse with bigger computers," he said. "We should be continuing to do the research and generating new data." Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society president Todd Lane said cutting modelling efforts made no sense. "(It) threatens our ability to predict future climate and the inherent risks," he said. "Climate science is not solved. Most of the uncertainty in climate projections is due to uncertainty about the ways to represent physical processes in climate models."Dr Marshall said CSIRO was not walking away from climate science. "We're focusing what we learnt from climate modelling into mitigation," he said. "Pretty much every aspect of life in Australia is being affected by climate change, from agriculture to health. We need to help those industries adapt and evolve."

Watchdog puts company directors on notice over disclosure of climate change risks

The corporate regulator has urged Australian companies to undertake formal modelling of the risks posed by climate change to their businesses, warning directors may be unable to avoid legal non-disclosure breaches if they have failed to properly assess it.
ASIC Commissioner John Price, speaking at a forum held by the Centre for Policy Development last night, said the Australian Securities & Investments Commission was focused on ensuring companies were correctly booking impairments and properly testing asset values.
"We are strongly focused on ensuring that, where the law requires it, companies disclose material climate change risks," Mr Price said.
The legal liability presented by the risk of climate change has grown in prominence in Australia since last year, when the prudential regulator said climate change was a "material" risk to companies and warned that company directors could be liable if they failed to incorporate climate change risks into their financial models and disclose the risks they faced.
The warnings came after a legal opinion provided by barrister Noel Hutley, SC, found many climate change risks "would be regarded by a court as being foreseeable at the present time" and Australian company directors "who fail to consider 'climate change risks' now could be found liable for breaching their duty of care and diligence in the future".
The opinion was commissioned by the Centre for Policy Development and the Future Business Council, was considered by senior participants from BlackRock, CBA, ANZ, Deutsche Bank, Qantas, ASIC, APRA and some of the largest superannuation funds.
Mr Price last night told a forum in Sydney: "The Hutley opinion highlights and reinforces the need for directors to adopt a probative and proactive approach in assembling the information reasonably required to inform their decision making in this area," Mr Price said. "Depending on the circumstances, it may be difficult for directors who have not even considered the issue to later seek to invoke the business judgment rule." Mr Price said ASIC was currently probing the climate-related disclosures of the 300 largest listed companies in Australia and would publish its findings later this year.
"In some cases, climate change risk and opportunity will be material to a company's prospects and must be disclosed in a prospectus in a clear, concise and effective way to ensure investors are able to make a fully informed investment decision," he said.
"In addition to these, the law may require climate risk to be disclosed in other contexts such as by way of continuous disclosure announcement or elsewhere." CPD policy director Sam Hurley and fellow Kate Mackenzie said Australia's response to the Financial Stability Board's International Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures had been "sluggish".
A recent report by Market Forces found that only about half of the 73 most climate-exposed companies in the ASX 200 identified climate change as a material risk in their latest reporting. An Ernst & Young report this year found only 12 out of 144 ASX-listed groups disclosed any climate analysis.
"International best practice is moving ahead rapidly," Mr Hurley said in a CPD report. He said some of the early attempts at scenario modelling by Australian companies "have employed questionable climate transition assumptions" and "many are still overlooking physical impacts and providing little indication that these exercises have influenced decisions"."As a developed economy with a large pool of pension assets, and exposures to transition and physical risks relating to climate change, we can and should do better," he said.

Climate change top of miners' risk fears

Australia's horror summer bushfires have put climate change at the forefront of risk factors for Australian mining companies, according to accounting and consulting major KPMG.
KPMG will release its 2021 Australian mining risk outlook on Tuesday. KPMG mining risk partner Caron Sugars said the bushfires, which swept across both sides of the country over summer, pushed business risks associated with climate change to the top of the thinking of Australian mining executives taking part in its annual survey.
The primary research for the KPMG study was conducted in January, as the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic were just beginning to emerge.
But Ms Sugars said that, while subsequent contact with senior mining executives had highlighted the impacts of the pandemic, the Australian sector had been well prepared to cope with its threat from a health and safety perspective - but was now looking more closely at the wider ramifications of similar threats.
"We've tested results with our clients and through the workshops we've been conducting. Typically not much changes year-on-year, but COVID has seen quite a significant change for us. The risks themselves don't change, though," she said.
"COVID was an event, not a risk, and what COVID has done is shine the light on health and safety risks, supply chain risks, liquidity and funding. And it really shows up that interconnectivity and what we're seeing now is more organisations trying to understand how these risks are interconnected, because they really can't manage them individually." KPMG Australian and global mining leader Trevor Hart told The Australian the risks to supply chains were brought into focus by the pandemic, as major suppliers in China and other manufacturing hubs were initially threatened by pandemic-related shutdowns.
Mr Hart said miners may begin to rethink previous policies of choosing the cheapest possible supply chains, and perhaps tie up more working capital in inventory and spare parts than they had previously done.
"Optionality and flexibility comes at a cost, and so there's no doubt that in the most stable of environments the push for efficiency is a really safe one. Where the environment becomes less certain you need some options, you need some flexibility, and that inherently is less efficient," he said.
"I think that companies now understand there's a cost they will need to incur to really protect the resilience of their business and that's been borne out through COVID." Ms Sugars said the different impact of the coronavirus across mining jurisdictions would also affect thinking about geopolitical risk for miners, given the sector had escaped relatively unscathed in Australia but had been much harder hit in South America. Climate change and natural disasters topped the list of leading risks facing the industry, according to the survey.

On climate change, IBA steps in where politicians fear to tread

THE 1994 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has failed to deliver the outcome its proponents had expected. It has failed to deliver agreement on binding greenhouse gas emission limits, at the 2009 Copenhagen conference or since.
That is why, in October 2012, Mary Robinson, a former UN commissioner for human rights and president of her eponymous climate justice foundation, challenged the International Bar Asso-ciation "to develop a working group on climate justice to provide leadership in shaping the global response to climate change".
In short, leaving the global response to climate change to sovereign states under the UN frame-work convention had not delivered the desired outcome, so it was necessary for lawyers to "shape" it.
The recent report of an IBA taskforce is a tour de force, not surprising given the calibre of the many human rights and environmental lawyers engaged in its preparation, including two Australians, Brian Preston, Chief Judge of the NSW Land and Environment Court and adjunct professor of Sydney Law School, and Jane McAdam, professor of law at the University of NSW.
The report acknowledges past failure: "The global response to the dangers of climate change has largely been conducted under the auspices of the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. Every year, states parties to both treaties meet with a view to progressing negotiations, though success has proved famou-sly elusive." It recognises that proponents of climate change reform had not succeeded while the debate was about economic and scientific considerations: "By adopting a justice and human rights-centred approach, the IBA intends to shift the focus of much-needed reform from purely economic and scientific considerations to the human rights and equity consequences of climate change".
The proponents of climate change reform have opened a new front in the battle which they see has a better chance of success - human rights.
The report begins: "Global clim-ate change is a defining challenge of our time". It then lists "extremes" of heat, drought and cold experienced in recent years, to ancho-r its legitimacy.
"These events, their causes and consequences, raise questions of justice and human rights," it says.
Of course, the extreme events are caused by man-made climate change, which is "grounded in the certainties of climate science": that is, the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, "representing the consensus view of climate scientists and other experts".
The critical legal premise of the report is: "Climate change affects everyone, but it disproportionately strikes those who have contributed least to it and who are also, for a variety of reasons, least well placed to respond." "By contrast, the main contributors to climate change - those with the largest carbon footprints, living and working in the world's wealthier regions - are also, by virtue of their wealth and/or access to resources, most insulated from it.
"This fundamental justice concern is exacerbated by the fact that climate change will strain the ability of many states, especially the poorest among them, to uphold their human-rights obligations." The report identifies all the areas of law relevant to "climate change justice", why existing laws have not delivered the outcomes the taskforce desires, and proposes how the law can be changed to achieve those outcomes.
The report says: "There is little doubt that climate change affects peoples' human rights ... Rights to life, health, food, shelter and water are all plainly affected by the ravag-es of climate change." They are "rights violations ... be-cause climate change is a preventable man-made phenomenon. Nevertheless, it is not easy, as a matter of law, to join up the dots between those emitting excessive greenhouse gases and those suffering the consequences - the law is not designed to that end, and difficult questions of causation and standing arise".
The report has a six-page "action matrix" of its recommendations, for the short, medium and long-term. The proposals are clever, bold, ambitious, comprehensive, detailed, far-reaching and totalitarian in scope.
If implemented, they would embed climate change human-rights considerations, legal rights and remedies, in domestic and international law and institutions, international trade agreements, and corporate decision-making.
A model climate change statute would include a standard of proof for causation that makes joining "up the dots" easier, and specifies that global climate models and statistical extrapolation would constitute sufficient proof.
Proposals for defining legal standing are expansive and consider, for example, granting standing "to litigate potential human rights violations that unborn generations will have to endure".
The report proposes means to overcome the incompatibility between climate change measures and the World Trade Organisation's objective of trade liberalisation, seeking to have such measures interpreted as falling within the exemption in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or amending the exemption to include them.
An international environmental court and a human right to a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, are long-term proposals.
Such revolutionary proposals demand robust debate and questioning. The taskforce was a response to political failure. Sovereign states would not come to the party.
Preston's assertions, reported in these pages last Friday, that "these proposals have been dictated by the nature of the problem, not by an attempt to impose particular policies" and "n our early discussions we were trying to ensure we did not take a particular viewpoint aligning ourselves with one sort of faction or another", are disingenuous.Josephine Kelly is a Sydney barrister.

Cost of catastrophe: firms can't afford to ignore climate change litigation risk

Climate change litigation is set to emerge as a significant risk for -corporations across all sectors of the Australian economy.
This is because of the fact that momentum is gathering for regulatory investigations and shareholder class actions against com-panies that fail to properly disclose the transition costs of moving to a lower carbon economy.
The attraction of these claims to regulators and litigation funders is that they won't face the trad-itional obstacle of "proving the science" of climate change.
They can also be brought under existing disclosure laws that are used to support the majority of regulatory investigations and shareholder class actions in respect of disclosure practices.
It is often overlooked that Australia has a history of climate change litigation - but almost always in the form of environmental impact assessment cases involving federal and state planning laws.
These cases have challenged decisions to permit major construction projects on the ground that there was a failure to properly assess the environmental and climate change impact of the projects, such as projected sea-level rises or coastal erosion.
This species of climate change litigation is limited in its effectiveness - the claims generally rely on administrative law, meaning courts cannot reassess the environmental impact of the underlying project or impose environ-mental sanctions. The main remedy is forcing the decision-maker to reconsider the approval decision, this time having more detailed regard to climate change issues.
That is a slow, case-by-case process that has not really engaged with the broader national and global debate over climate change impacts and remediation.
Similarly, while "mass tort" claims are possible, they generally also face major obstacles - not everyone has standing to sue in tort, and even when they can, establishing causation - the link between a particular defendant's conduct and an impact on the environment - requires difficult scientific evidence.
The cases are fraught with uncertainty and expense. None of these avenues is attractive to -pro-moters of class action litigation, nor do they raise issues within the ambit of the Australian Securities & Investments Commission or other financial regulators.
That may be about to change. Regulators around the world (including ASIC) are increasingly rec-ognising the financial impact of the "transition risks" of climate change.
What are these transition risks? Examples include the increased frequency of extreme weather events creating a greater risk that a business will lose access to key -inputs such as water and sewerage; or the increased risk of power -outages creating greater costs for companies that depend sig-nificantly on energy transmission.
A further risk arises from the likelihood of changes to environmental or emission regulations that could cause fossil fuels to be repriced as part of a move to a lower carbon norm, meaning the balance sheet value of proven -deposits in the extractive industry become unrealisable at historical values.
This risk of "stranded assets" is particularly topical, given Aus-tralia's commitment to the Paris Agreement and the impact that policies that limit global warming will have on fuel reserves -currently sitting in Australian corporate -balance sheets. All of these risks could be material to an Australian company's financial position and could affect the costs and profitability of its core business.
Material risks are required to be disclosed under a variety of Australian laws; the ASX listing rules require the immediate disclosure of material risks and the ASX has recently expanded its guidance to specifically include the disclosure of "environmental and social sustainability risks".
Most shareholder class actions filed in Australia to date (especially those supported by litigation funders) have involved allegations that a listed entity -failed to disclose its exposure to a material risk in a timely fashion.
Often this information has involved traditional business risks affecting profit and earnings forecasts, but precisely the same principles could be applied to companies that do not consider or disclose the impact of the trans-ition risks associated with climate change.
If those risks ultimately do -affect the company's operations, it is easy to envisage ASIC or a class action promoter initiating an investigation into when it knew about the risk to its business and whether the risk should have been disclosed earlier.
We are seeing exactly that trend emerge in Britain and the US, with the regulators in both -jurisdictions initiating investi-gations in the past 24 months into listed entities regarding the -adequacy of disclosure of business risk from climate change in annual reports.
They are looking at whether the balance sheet value of proven resource reserves have been mat-erially overstated in view of likely future emission restrictions.
The focus of foreign regulators is often predictive of local trends - both regulatory and of the class action litigation risk.
The result is a heightened need for all Australian companies to examine closely their exposure to the transition risks associated with climate change and the move to a lower carbon economy and to -ensure that all foreseeable risks are assessed and disclosed where necessary.Jason Betts and Peter Briggs are partners at Herbert Smith Freehills.

Too much ideology and not enough science informs the debate on environmental issues
If I were in any doubt that the -theory of anthropogenic global warming - now more commonly referred to as climate change -because it's a more encompassing term - is more religion than science, the reaction to the few pieces I have written on the topic completely dispels any misgivings I may have had.
Not that I am totally aware of the insults and abuse thrown in my direction - I don't use Twitter - but my friends let me know how I am trending on that damnatory and vicious medium. I'm akin to an apostate in an orthodox church. My reputation must be sullied, my credentials questioned, my views firmly rejected.
Don't get me wrong, I can take it. I rather enjoy getting those -obnoxious and unmannerly emails accusing me of failing to care about my children, my grandchildren and the world. And those are the more pleasant ones.
It's obvious from these encounters that true AGW believers are ardent followers of the Alinsky playbook. Attack the person, not the ideas. Use damning terms such as "climate denier" (these believers forget the Godwin rule here). Keep the pressure on and attempt to isolate that person. Ridicule her work. Add in some -serious-looking data, claim that all the experts agree and the task is done.
In this context, let me point out that quite a few AGW disciples even took offence to the article I wrote about the replication crisis in science and the lack of faith we should place in the peer-review process. (Pal-review is a more -accurate description.) None of this could possibly apply to climate science, came their firm reply. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports are beyond reproach. The latest report involved 90 of the world's top experts - selected by the IPCC, by the way - referencing more than 6000 papers. There is no uncertainty, there are no doubts. No one should be allowed to call into question the credibility of the IPCC reports. To do so is to act in a malign fashion, possibly doing the bidding of self-serving and wicked commercial parties in the fossil fuel industry as well as complying with the wishes of the publication's proprietor.
But why don't we all just dial it down a notch and treat each other as interested, intelligent individuals? If people actually bothered to read the IPCC reports, with all their long and tortuous prose, they would realise there are very large elements of uncertainty to many of the findings and this is acknow-ledged in the body of the reports. But as Al Gore, of An Inconvenient Truth fame and former US vice-president, admitted, the executive summary of the latest IPCC report was deliberately "torqued up to get the -attention of policymakers around the world". For the scientists who were -involved in the report, they should be very alarmed to hear this. To torque something up is not consistent with high-quality science.
Let me cover three aspects of the latest IPCC report: the issue of extreme weather events, the role that nuclear power can play in a low-emissions future, and the wonky economics that underpins the report.
The proposition that climate change will lead to more extreme weather events - think droughts, flooding, cyclones and hurricanes - is a favourite of the AGW set.
Unlike a slow rise in global temperatures, extreme weather events provide the sensational background to calls for "more action on climate change". Leaving aside the confusion here between weather and climate, credible scientists will admit the link between rising temperatures and extreme weather events is particularly uncertain. This is actually admitted by the IPCC in various reports.
And here is an important point made by Richard Lindzen, who was professor of meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is a leading figure in climate science: "Global warming refers to the increase in temperature of about 1C since the Little Ice Age â€¦ Weather extremes involve temperature changes of the order of 20C. Such large changes have a -profoundly different origin from global warming. The models used to project global warming predict that this temperature -difference will decrease rather than increase." In the latest IPCC report, -indeed, it is conceded that there is little proof that there have been more generalised droughts as a -result of climate change. Also, it is noted that "numerous studies â€¦ have reported a decreasing trend in the global number of tropical -cyclones and/or the globally accumulated cyclonic energy".
Let me deal quickly with the role nuclear power might play in reducing CO2 emissions. To the consternation of many scientists, the latest IPCC report seeks to downplay that role while overstating the risks and understating the benefits. Intermittent renewable energy is the way forward, according to the latest treatise, in association with complete decarbon-isation of electricity. This is not science talking but ideology.
But let me come to my deepest reservation about the latest IPCC report, and it relates to my area of speciality: economics. Take it from me, these authors have no idea about the true economic costs of seeking to limit the rise in the world temperature to 1.5C and how these need to be assessed against the benefits.
Indeed, the authors make no attempt to undertake a cost-benefit analysis of the measures, such as deep reductions in agricultural emissions and decarbonisation of electricity, which it is assumed are needed to meet this self-imposed target.
And here is the gobbledygook explanation for this failure: "Since policy goals like limiting warming to 1.5C do not directly result from a money metric trade-off -between mitigation and damages, associated shadow prices can differ from the social cost of carbon in a cost-benefit analysis." To translate: because there is no economic basis for the predetermined climate goal based on the benefits outweighing the costs, there is no point undertaking any real economic analysis.
Luckily, Robert Murphy of Texas Tech University has been able to extract from the IPCC -report the implied level of carbon tax that would be required to meet the climate goal. It ranges from $US135 a ton to $US5500 a ton of CO2 emissions by 2030 (a ridiculously wide range that further calls into question the IPCC's analysis). If this tax were imposed in the US, it would add up to $48 a gallon (or $12.68 a litre) to the cost of petrol.
What the IPCC report is saying in -effect is that to meet the -assumed climate goal, the required carbon tax needs to be between $US135 and $US5500 a ton which, according to Murphy, would be economically efficient only if the estimated optimal carbon tax is also in this range.
This is where the work of William Nordhaus becomes important. A firm believer in climate change and the need for government action (he advocates a global carbon tax), he was recently awarded the Nobel prize in -economics.
But here's the thing: his latest estimate of the optimal carbon tax is $US44 a ton, which is less than one-third of the lowest figure nominated by the IPCC. This is the tax that maximises the net benefits of carbon abatement in terms of environmental benefits relative to the no action baseline.The bottom line is this: the IPCC reports, including the latest one with its torqued-up summary, are not the last word on climate change. There is plenty of room for respectful debate, both fundamental and on the details. Where the IPCC fails most dramatically is in respect of the economic analysis, which essentially ignores the costs of abatement as well as the scope for adaptation.

Curtin prospect pushes climate-change barrow

The wealthy businesswoman running as an independent in the Western Australian seat of Curtin, Louise Stewart, will make climate change a key part of her campaign after her Liberal rival claimed -humanity's contribution to global warming was "very minimal".
Ms Stewart, a "socially progressive" lifelong Liberal voter, also revealed she had spoken about climate-change policy to scientist Tim Flannery and former Olympic skier-turned-independent Warringah candidate Zali Steggall.
She said Liberal candidate Celia Hammond's doubts about man-made climate change, revealed in The Australian yesterday, proved the former university chief was "out of step with mainstream views" in Curtin, in Perth's wealthy western suburbs.
"The science is settled, the debate is definitely over - climate change is caused by human activity," Ms Stewart said. "We need to have deeper emissions cuts quicker. The debate to have now is how we are going to achieve -(emission reduction) targets." Ms Stewart appears to have hardened her stance on climate change in the wake of Ms Hammond's comments.
She said she wanted to see greater investment in renewable energy and the introduction of a "commissioner of climate impact" to examine the effects of climate change in Australia.
She would continue to discuss the issue with Professor Flannery, who was recently appointed to a climate research role at the Australian Museum.
Professor Flannery has been accused by some of alarmism on climate science over his 2004 warning that Perth would become the first "ghost metropolis" of the 21st century because of its scarce water supply.
Ms Stewart said she had also spoken to Ms Steggall, who is campaigning to oust Tony Abbott from his northern Sydney seat of Warringah. Ms Steggall said Mr Abbott was out of step with voters because he supported coalmining.
Ms Hammond said on Monday she believed humanity's contribution to global warming had likely been "very minimal". She rejected scientific opinion that the burning of fossil fuels was the key factor driving global warming.
Her comments have also emboldened the Greens, who secured 14.2 per cent of the vote in Curtin at the last election, just behind Labor on 15.7 per cent.
WA Greens senator Jordon Steele-John described Ms Hammond's views as "absolutely outrageous and frankly downright dangerous".
"Not only is she denying the -accepted science of climate change, but proving that she will be a servant of the fossil-fuel lobby if elected as the member for Curtin," he said.
"The people of Curtin want a socially progressive representative who supports urgent action to tackle climate change."The Greens' candidate in Curtin, Cameron Pidgeon, was unavailable for comment.

IF WE CAN'T BEAT CLIMATE CHANGE, WE CAN LIVE WITH IT

Global warming already may be an unpreventable reality, so we'll have to adapt
The Rio Earth Summit of 1992 is generally accepted as the international event that first drew attention to the dangers of global warming and that led to the Kyoto Protocol (not ratified by Australia) in 1997.
In the 23 years since Rio, during which the global population has grown by 35 per cent from 5.5 billion to 7.4 billion people and global gross domestic product has more than doubled, greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 60 per cent and atmospheric CO2 concentrations have continued to lift in an unbroken line from about 356 parts per million to 398ppm today.
We've seen average global temperatures increase by 0.1C-0.2C (including an apparent 17-year pause in changes in average temperatures) to be 0.9C above 1900 levels and up 1C since the industrial revolution, and are now at their highest levels for centuries.
Sea levels have risen by 7cm, species extinction and coral bleaching events continue (although mainly caused by habitat destruction and contamination, not global warming), Arctic ice and Greenland ice are reducing, but perhaps not Antarctic ice, and glaciers are melting.
There has been no statistically significant change in incidence or intensity of hurricanes, cyclones, storms, floods, bushfires or hailstorms; no increase in insured losses due to natural hazards beyond that explainable by asset inflation and population growth and spread. In the context of century-long trends, this paints a pretty unremarkable picture of the past two decades for the planet and for the Australian continent.
Of course, global warming and climate change refer to long-term trends spanning periods of decades to centuries. The World Meteorological Society defines climate as the average of our weather across several decades so as to smooth the strong influence of natural variability on surface air temperatures.
Some forecasts suggest a further increase in global temperatures of about 2C by the end of the 21st century with quite alarming consequences of such a shift to a warmer climate. This has been the focus of attention at the Paris climate talks.
But whatever the conclusions reached at this conference - multi-decade commitments and near-term actions - one thing that will not be changed is the trend of global weather across the next 20 years. Make all humankind carbon neutral today, and some polar ice will continue to melt, glaciers recede, species disappear, sea levels rise and so on because of the inertia in our climate system.
The weather in the 2030s probably won't be any different to that were we to do everything or nothing. This cannot be an argument against good long-term policy that is aimed at preventing irreversible climate change by decarbonising economies and reducing global emissions by a further 80 per cent or so by 2050. But along the way we should expect lots of ambiguous signals and unanswerable questions such as "is this particular cyclone/bushfire/drought/heatwave/flood/storm surge â€¦ evidence of global warming?" Extreme weather, no matter how spectacular or destructive, cannot inform our views on climate change unless trend data covering generations is available.
Contrary to some of the more hyperbolic claims, our planet is not at risk from extended global warming but our lifestyles and immediate environment may be, as well as the wellbeing of vulnerable communities and species.
So when the average temperature across our continent is another 1C higher, say after 2050, at a parochial level what should we expect and how should we prepare?
From a climate perspective, Sydney may feel a bit more like Brisbane is today, or Beirut; Melbourne like a blend of Sydney, Adelaide and Rome. I doubt our most recent immigrants will be discomforted by this.
More important, we can understand how lifestyles have adapted to relatively warmer and drier climates by observing practices overseas.
Dwellings are designed differently, school and working hours and eating times adjusted to avoid the midday heat (siestas?). Water is respected as a very scarce resource and much of it is recycled. Desalination plants may yet be central to our water management strategy. Along some coastlines and estuaries sea walls and surge barriers are built.
Governments need to be careful how they intervene. If their objective is to materially shift the trajectory of climate change, it's worth remembering that the futures of our coral reefs, coastlines, rainfall and drought patterns, and weather have little to do with Australia's climate change strategy except, long term, where it helps discover globally useful enabling technologies or contributes to an international effort that is supported by the major emitters.
As with the economy, the role of government in addressing climate change is a significant but small part of the solution and includes setting internationally equitable targets for emissions reductions, funding relevant research and development in new energy technologies, and supporting key institutions such as the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO.
But, as importantly, federal, state and local government attention must focus on helping us to adapt to and to mitigate near-term climate-driven changes in our environment and society in general. Fighting to preserve our current lifestyles may be a costly indulgence when pragmatic adaptive steps appropriate to the climate ahead are available to us.
This means anticipating and mitigating a future of water shortages and droughts, higher utility, food and insurance costs, and the impact of extreme weather events and natural disasters. And, of course, requiring responsible management of finite resources, fragile environments and better land use.
We'll need flood control systems, coastal protections, up-graded emergency response processes and technologies, energy and water-efficient buildings and landscapes, improved planning frameworks and zoning restrictions, state-of-the-art communications capability and efficient healthcare for more heat-stressed patients, plus forecasting and predictive capability for extreme weather events. These are "no regrets" steps - no matter the actual trend of our weather or the ultimate efficacy of emission reduction strategies.
These initiatives do not require global accords, are within our control, affordable and make sense under all planning scenarios. Australia could thrive rather than just survive in a globally warming world and, reassuringly, work is under way to this end.
The seminal work of Charles Darwin's The Origin of the Species is sometimes (incorrectly) summarised as meaning survival of the strongest or the fittest. In fact, his model of evolution and species resilience emphasises survival of the most adaptable. This may be an appropriate guiding principle for many communities and policymakers in the decades ahead.Ziggy Switkowski is a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science and chairman of Suncorp and NBN Co. These are his personal views.

Native species under climate change threat

CLIMATE change poses a grave threat to native species and a boon for introduced pests such as the cane toad.
Human responses to climate change, such as increased farming in northern Australia, could also harm fragile birds and animals, a WWF report says.
Species identified as being under threat of extinction due to global warming include bilbies, rock wallabies, quolls, turtles and Gouldian finches.
The report -- Australian Species and Climate Change -- says higher temperatures and altered rainfall patterns will hurt such species, while bushfires and invasive species will also increase.
``Climate change may mean more frequent and hotter wildfires, reduced connectivity between already fragmented habitats and the expansion of invasive species like cane toads,'' the report says.
The European fox would also be a beneficiary at the expense of native prey. ``Many weeds and pest animals are favoured by changing conditions, as they can colonise new habitats rapidly,'' it says. ``Pests such as the cane toad will thrive in warmer conditions and move into new areas.
``Weeds are often more effective than native plants at dispersal, in part because they are often transported unintentionally by people.''
WWF says the parts of Australia which are protected by national parks and reserves are not large or connected enough to protect endangered species.
Changed human activity is also considered a threat. ``Agricultural expansion into parts of Australia, such as the northern savannahs, that are predicted to have more rainfall, will mean old threats to species in new places,'' it says.

No change to climate of hot air for ABC staff

Climate activism within the ABC has been laid bare in a treasure trove of emails unearthed by a Freedom of Information application. Staff emails show an "ABC-Staff climate crisis advisory group" is proceeding in defiance of the board and management, and that senior staff have pushed the ABC to adopt a climate advocacy role like The Guardian.
The internal communications also reveal that senior management have been considering -"solutions-based" journalism on climate change - a form of -reporting akin to advocacy under another guise. Some ABC staffers also raised concerns about the public broadcaster wasting energy and being "hypocritical".
Hundreds of pages of email exchanges were released under an FOI request by Evan Mulholland of the Institute of Public Affairs after The Australian revealed the initial move to establish the climate group. Melbourne-based radio producer Barbara Heggen sent an email to an ABC-wide list on Sunday, November 17, and it was reported in this newspaper later that day by media editor Leo Shanahan.
"Hi all, just to let you know," came one of dozens of reply-to-all responses the next day, "this email chain has turned up in today's Australian." Two days later, ABC chair Ita Buttrose told ABC radio that this was "one of those ideas that is not going to happen" because "the ABC leadership team and managing director have thought otherwise". Yet the day after her firm ruling ABC staff anonymously briefed The Guardian Australia that the climate crisis group would not be stopped.
Emails from January this year now show staff have ignored Buttrose's edict. Heggen was trying to set up a Melbourne meeting and was receiving plenty of encouragement from colleagues.
In one emailed response, a staffer (most names have been redacted) complained there was often "a million lights still on" in the early hours of the morning at the ABC's Southbank studios and that they "walk around turning these off". The prospective climate group member added: "My small contribution to saving the Earth." Questions I sent to Heggen about the status of the group this week have not received a response. But her original email said the group would gather the "brains trust" of the ABC to discuss ways to "report on and inform" Australians using a "solutions journalism" approach, and would report to management with ideas for responding to the "climate crisis both internally and externally".
Just hours after Heggen's call to arms (before Buttrose's intervention) the ABC's editorial director, Craig McMurtrie, responded with information about a meeting a month earlier at the ABC's -Ultimo headquarters involving the broadcaster's science specialists. McMurtrie explained there were concerns about "audience -fatigue" and staffers who were "unclear on why we wouldn't follow the Guardian model - which tends more towards advocacy journalism".
One of the most senior journalists at the broadcaster, McMurtrie outlined efforts to organise lunchtime speakers on climate change and scientific briefings to look at ways of "sharpening our coverage" including through "solutions-based" journalism. "If I can help, let me know - the more brain power on this the better," he wrote.
Other responses from ABC staff around the nation are telling. It was a "fabulous idea" and an "awesome initiative" that showed "great thinking". Many were eager to be involved.
"I have just been looking into how other media organisations are dealing with coverage of climate change," came one reply. "The New York Times has a desk dedicated to climate change coverage â€¦" "Hi Barbara," responded another, "Would love to take part. I do most of the enviro reporting for our team and it's a massive issue for our audience and young people so would be good to get some representation in there." Another staffer doing academic research on journalism and agriculture described it as a "great" idea. "I am very interested - particularly from a talkback radio perspective - where anyone and everyone tries to weigh in on the topic." Many replies gave the impression the ABC does not provide enough coverage of global warming or display a sufficiently strident editorial line "A friend asked if it was possible to have a 'climate' tab on our news website," said one. "I would say the issue is as fundamental as politics and it deserves its own tab." This staffer wanted to "lobby management" to do more on climate and the environment itself. "In Hobart we have a large surface area of roofing, perfect for solar panels and water catchment, along with our carpark area, collecting this water and storing it to irrigate the ridiculous amount of grass around the building." Then there was the ABC staffer from marketing. "I'm not a content maker, but if this idea gets off the ground and you need a marketing person involved, let me know." Another said: "This is the issue of our times, please count me in Barbara, very keen to be part of discussions, as would some of my team." "I am in," replied another enthusiast, "and how we deal with people who say 'sunspots and volcanoes' without being condescending and infuriated." Others pointed out there were already many climate-related initiatives under way at the ABC. "But that's no reason not to have a group like this too." Then there was this Sydney-based staffer. "I did a quick meta-analysis of climate reporting in Australia and found the word climate change was mentioned less than 12 per cent of the time across all digital stories regarding fish kill stories since January. I don't think this is acceptable." We are left to wonder about the appropriate percentage of climate change references in fish kill stories. A staffer who emailed from Brisbane boasted about switching off TVs late at night: "They're everywhere and no one is watching them, often even during the day. At least our building has 'smart' lighting. Best to avoid hypocrisy where poss." Then a crushing intervention: "Colleagues, could you please use 'Reply' rather than 'Reply all'. Thank you, and my apologies for the 'Reply all'." Another respondent seconded this idea saying the group replies were "littering people's inboxes with the stuff that is irrelevant to work". One email wondered where "middle Australia" stood and why "denial" is so prevalent. "Is it because they feel they are being shouted at? Blamed?" Perhaps the most insightful and pithy of our anonymous ABC insiders offered a one-line reply to Heggen's climate proposal: "As if we don't do heaps on this topic -already."

Spurting cuttlefish of the green Left muddy the waters on climate change truths

Fortunately for all of us, the climate isn't changing as rapidly as the politics and language around it. What started out as global warming was redefined by proponents as climate change, enabling them to pivot from having to explain record cold snaps to including them in the catch-all of change.
Now the political barometer is generating more language shifts. The alarmists, apparently, haven't seen enough children crying at climate change protests so they want to up the ante. Left-wing newspaper The Guardian (along with The Guardian Australia online) is leading the crusade with a new dictate to staff - they should refer to the climate issue as an emergency, crisis or breakdown.
The paper's official style guide has been amended saying the phrase "climate change is no longer considered to accurately reflect the seriousness of the -situation".
Wow. That is change you can almost believe in.
Up bobbed the phrase immediately in today's Australian coverage. The Guardian Australia's political editor Katharine Murphy covered the election fallout in full compliance. "This was an election in large part about the climate emergency, and the field evidence shows Australia in 2019 is deeply divided about the road ahead," she wrote.
The Guardian is changing language in a brazen attempt to change politics. Later in the story, Murphy went on: "In his concession, Shorten noted that the -divisions on the climate crisis were etched into Saturday night's result." It hardly needs saying this is the epitome of Orwellian. As -George Orwell wrote in Politics and the Eng-lish Language: "If thought corrupts language then language can also corrupt thought." The Guardian doesn't like the way you are thinking so it is adopting more emotive language to frighten you into its camp. So they've changed the language.
As Orwell wrote in his seminal essay: "The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one's real and one's declared aims, one turns, as it were instinctively, to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish spurting out ink." And, just like that, you'll now hear more words such as emergency, crisis and breakdown. Expect ABC reporters to broadcast them, too.
"The Guardian has updated its style guide to introduce terms that more accurately describe the environmental crises facing the world," the paper said in a statement. "Instead of 'climate change', the preferred terms are 'climate emergency, crisis or breakdown' and 'global heating' is favoured over 'global warming', although the original terms are not banned. We want to ensure that we are being scientifically precise while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue. The phrase 'climate change', for example, sounds rather passive and gentle when what scientists are talking about is a catastrophe for humanity." Oh, The Guardian is also sceptical about the word sceptic. Apparently it's not alarmist enough either. The thought police have dictated that sceptics are now referred to as "climate science deniers" or "climate deniers" - terms that shamelessly echo the disgrace of Holocaust denial.Even when they don't have newsprint editions, the green Left is dealing in ink; like spurting cuttlefish, they want to muddy the waters and won't be denied.

Climate change challenge for urban design projects

Buildings must evolve to deal with the challenges thrown up by the changing climate, according to the judges of leading architectural prize awarded on Wednesday night.
The art of designing for a more complex, and potentially harsher climatic conditions, has been a priority for architects.
Malcolm Snow, jury chair and chief executive of the City Renewal Authority in Canberra, said the industry was facing several "wicked problems" that were being addressed through urban design.
"One of the big trends is, of course, climate change," Mr Snow told The Australian.
"Increasingly, environmental sustainability has certainly become more mainstream. In the past, the social dimension of sustainability has been lacking. These awards show and demonstrate that community design to serve the people who are going to use these buildings is an important consideration," he said.
"The collaboration aspect that was seen in these project awards this year was really outstanding. I think that's a mark of good urban design. It's not only just co-design, it's testing the boundaries of design practice to drawing fresh ideas and new approaches, " he added.
Brisbane's Howard Smith Wharves development has tied with the Maitland Levee and Riverlink Building in NSW to take out the Australian Urban Design Awards top award.
The two projects were among five overall national winners at last night's awards in Melbourne, which celebrate high quality, contemporary Australian urban design. Commendations were also awarded to five other projects across the four categories.
Howard Smith Wharves and the Maitland Levee and Riverlink Building won the Built projects, city and regional scale, award. The Brisbane project, by HSW Nominees, Urbis and Woods Bagot, was congratulated for its transformation of the challenging site beneath the Story Bridge into a contemporary public space. Judges said the Maitland building, designed by McGregor Coxall & Chrofi, was an "exemplar in regional urban design and renewal in Australia." Both projects were designed to bring their communities together and help people connect. "Cities should be supporting the way in which we connect with each other as citizens, as people," Mr Snow said.
Tract's Victorian Ferrars Street Education & Community Precinct project and Hassell's Flour Mill of Summer Hill site in NSW jointly won the Built projects, local and neighbourhood scale, prize. The Leadership, advocacy and research, city and regional scale award was presented to Leigh Woolley Architect and Urban Design Consultant for the Tasmanian Building Height Standards Review project.
Aspect Studios with Cox Architecture's Caulfield to Dandenong Level Crossing Removal Project and MGS Architects and Jacobs Architects Rosanna Station, both in Melbourne, received commendations for built design alongside the Tasmanian Bridge of Remembrance by Denton Corker Marshall.Mr Snow led the judging panel, made up of Linda Corkery, discipline director landscape architecture at UNSW, Michael McKeown, director at Adelaide's Jensen Plus, and Amy Muir, director of MUIR Architecture.

Medical bodies should butt out of political issues they know nothing about
On Monday the Royal Australian College of Physicians held a Global Day of Climate Action to pressure world governments into enacting policies on CO2 emissions. This is part of a broader presence with other medical org-anisations at a UN climate change meeting as an organisation known as Doctors for Climate -Action.
This is a perfect opportunity to question the appropriateness of fragmented and largely isolated doctors' groups expending their resources on what are ultimately, political activities - not in the interests of the profession.
Including the official stamps and logos of 50 other medical organisations, the Doctors for Climate Action consensus statement references a "second report of the Lancet Commission on Climate Change and Health" released in June and remarks on "the wealth of available evidence" in making its argument to pressure countries to "commit to meaningful and urgent action to combat the adverse health impacts of climate change".
Yet the consensus statement does not extrapolate on any particular policy, offer any detail on the extent of mitigation suggested or account for the particular empirical gains and losses of any proposed action. There is simply no detail whatsoever.
Of course, we should not expect policy detail. Although highly trained, medical practitioners are, by and large, unqualified in the area of climate science. Climate change is not underpinned by the discipline of medicine. Medical degrees do not involve study of geothermal science or climatology. Further, climate change policy requires expertise across various fields including philosophy, politics, history and economics - all outside the scope of medical training. Accordingly, support for climate change action in these circumstance is no more than an exercise in vanity.
These organisations are not democratically representative of doctors and they know no more about the solutions to climate change than anybody else.
Make no mistake, they are abusing their statutory powers of automatic power over doctors to pursue a political agenda. They are not representative of ordinary doctors.
Australia is home to tens of thousands of doctors. All of them have sacrificed greatly to reach their positions. All of them are needed and relied on by people in need. Critically, all of them trade precariously on their reputation for honesty to continue their craft. As a basic tenet, this reputation should be preserved, protected and cherished by any body claiming to represent doctors.
In the main, doctors join professional colleges because they are required to, to practise and to be able to bill under Medicare. For example, the Royal Australian College of Physicians demands membership to be licensed as a specialist; there is no democracy about it. For instance, you cannot practise as a cardiologist or oncologist without joining.
This is the case for all specialties. This year my own college, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, failed 56 per cent of candidates in one exam while collecting millions of dollars in exam fees. I paid more than $7000 to sit three exams. How can a multiple choice question exam possibly cost $1910?
Despite often claiming to speak on behalf of the entire profession, thousands of doctors choose not join the AMA.
The AMA collects fees to advocate for the medical profession, yet it has position statements for everything from children in detention to the sex life of inmates in prison.
It advocates for: "Conjugal visitation programs â€¦ supported by access to safe-sex equipment and make provision for same-gender partners." This is more sinister than just mission creep. It speaks of a group of individuals who have lost touch with reality and their responsibility to remain advocates within their scope of responsibility and expertise.
With such tenuous claims to truly represent all doctors, it is irresponsible that doctors' groups have taken polemic positions on climate change and abused the budgets entrusted to them to pursue a political agenda. The profession should pride itself on its practical help to the human race. But we are no more qualified to pontificate to the world on climate change than any other group.Grant Ross is a medical practitioner and a senior registrar of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.

The Ferocious Summer: Palmer's Penguins and the Warming of Antarctica
By Meredith Hooper
Profile, 300pp, $32.95
MY first view of Palmer Station on the western Antarctic Peninsula was in the middle of the 1999 winter. I was on the US research vessel Nathaniel B. Palmer, working with colleagues on the Long Term Ecological Research program of the US National Science Foundation. In mid winter the landscape is harsh and bleak, almost monochrome, with the station buildings nestled on a small promontory overlooking Arthur Harbour. The numerous small islands in the surrounding waters were snow and ice-covered, and no birds or seals were present. With the exception of those at the station and on our vessel, there was no sign of life. The precipitous mountains that form the spine of the Antarctic Peninsula set the backdrop; the scene from the vessel could hardly contrast more with that in the middle of the Antarctic summer, when the islands and all coastal ice-free areas of the Antarctic mainland are home to thousands of penguins, petrels, skuas and seals.
The Antarctic Peninsula region is warming faster than anywhere else on Earth. The western side of the Antarctic Peninsula facing the Pacific Ocean is warming 10 times faster than the global mean warming rate. In the past 50 years, the mean winter temperature has increased by 4.5C.
This anomalous rapid-warming situation has yet to be explained or modelled, despite concerted international efforts to do so. This temperature increase has been associated with regional loss of winter sea ice, on which the Adelie species of penguin depends.
Fortuitously, seabird research has provided long-term data on the population dynamics for most of the species of the Palmer area for more than 30 years, and has provided insights into how predicted changes in climate might affect the world's oceans, its wildlife and the Antarctic landscape into the next century.
Meredith Hooper spent the 2001-02 summer at Palmer Station living and working with US scientists and support staff, sharing their daily routines, challenges and occasional opportunities to relax.
Palmer Station is the focus of the seabird research for the LTER, drawing on more than three decades of continuous research into the seabirds that breed in the vicinity.
Penguins are considered an indicator species, providing a signal on the state of health of their marine ecosystem, and changes in their populations over the long term (be it increasing or decreasing) provide scientists with data about the Southern Ocean and the Antarctic ecosystem that is impossible to obtain by other means. Changes in climate results in changes to the physical environment, and the penguins' population trends provide a readily observed indication of the response by the ocean's food webs to the changed conditions. Decreased sea ice may result in less winter food for the penguins, but warming may provide another species the opportunity to colonise areas previously covered in ice and snow.
The 2001-02 summer was an anomalous season, truly a ferocious summer, and the book is a witness's account of the researchers' efforts at Palmer during some of the most extreme weather conditions recorded there. Pressure cells that under normal circumstances persist for a few days stayed around for weeks or longer. The summer rapidly became the field season from hell, with massive summer storms dumping unseasonable snowfall, burying the penguin colonies under metres of snow at the height of the nesting efforts. The altered weather conditions hurt the penguins, reducing their breeding success. Chicks and adult penguins starved to death.
Stations elsewhere in the Antarctic recorded rainfalls and temperature maximums exceeded previous records. The anomalous 2001-02 summer with its extreme weather events and conditions was not confined to the Antarctic -- all southern hemisphere continents experienced highly unusual weather conditions -- perhaps a foretaste of the types of weather predicted under climate change scenarios: deluges and bushfires, Christmas snow in Tasmania and coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef from warmer-than-normal tropical waters.
From her third visit, with a national Antarctic program, Hooper has written a book that is unique among the wide-ranging Antarctic literature of recent times. The book is a delight to read, drawing in threads from her experiences during the summer living and working at an Antarctic station, describing the day-to-day routines, the changing landscape around Palmer within the summer, and providing the human and scientific contexts of the research efforts and the contribution to climate change science in a remarkably intimate manner.
Eric Woehler has been working on Southern Ocean seabirds for almost 30 years, with research interests in long-term population trends of penguins and petrels.

Green finance needed to tackle climate change
The Australian
January 16, 2020 Thursday, Australian Edition

A new year and a new decade should be a time for optimism, but it's hard to shake the sense of frustration around action on climate change.
Last month's 25th Conference of Parties (COP 25), the United Nations' annual climate change conference, reaffirmed the importance of reducing global carbon emissions but failed to set out an ambitious new agenda for doing so.
In 2015, COP 21 produced the Paris Agreement, which recognised the urgent need to drastically cut emissions by 2030 to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees. Each COP since then has renewed the commitment to that goal. But so far, we're failing to achieve it, and failing badly.
A recent UN report revealed the still-growing gap between carbon reduction targets and actual carbon emissions. Each year that emissions continue to rise makes it harder to meet our 2030 targets. Harder to protect our natural environment. Harder to ease the economic pain of climate change.
Injecting new urgency into the actions of governments and businesses should be the priority. In many countries, decisions are being made now that will shape entire economic structures for decades to come. If those decisions are not made on a sustainable, low-carbon basis, we'll be locking in high emissions for the foreseeable future.
Sometimes, climate change can feel like an impossibly huge problem to tackle. But the solution can perhaps be summed up in one word - investment. National governments and other state entities have their part to play, but only the private sector can marshal the sum of money required.
That means boosting the green finance market. Investor appetite for green products is growing - in an HSBC survey conducted earlier this year, 63 per cent of our investor clients said they would enter or expand their presence in green finance over the next two years.
However, the market is still sub-scale, held back by a lack of investible projects. Looking at green bonds alone, issuance in the first three quarters of 2019 was almost $US190bn, a big leap from the roughly $US115bn in the same period last year. But this is only a small dent in the trillions of dollars of green investment required by 2030.
Worse still, only 26 per cent of issuance in 2019 was attached to emerging market projects, far below what is required to guarantee long-term sustainable economic growth in those countries.
Targeted changes can make a difference, though. The first is encouraging better disclosure of climate risks. When investors have a clear idea of which businesses and sectors are most exposed to the impact of rising temperatures, they can make better decisions with their money.
Wide adoption of standardised disclosure principles, such as those published by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, will increase the number of viable projects for investors, and help with the second change - driving more green finance activity in the real economy.
So far, green finance issuance has been dominated by national governments and financial entities. That can't continue. Green finance participation is particularly important in high-carbon sectors, such as energy generation and heavy manufacturing.
Here, transitioning to lower emissions is fraught with risk, but will provide huge opportunities for those firms that are successful. The right kind of financing at the right time will be crucial.
There are some signs that these sectors are starting to get to grips with the transition - recently we've seen the formation of industry organisations, such as Responsible Steel, that push for lower emissions in specific sectors of the economy. The longer businesses take to adjust to a low-carbon mindset, the more likely they are to suffer blowback from climate-aware consumers and investors.
The third change is making sustainable infrastructure an asset class in its own right. A number of studies show that there is currently a global infrastructure investment deficit of between $US40 trillion and $US70 trillion. We simply don't spend enough money on big ticket items like roads, railways and power generation.
Bridging this gap sustainably is vital. A separate asset class would allow products to become more standardised, more transparent and properly impact-linked.
The need for infrastructure and other green investment in cities is particularly acute. Cities generate over 70 per cent of global carbon emissions, but most cities do not have direct capital market access and cannot easily invest money to reduce this figure.
That's why the fourth change on the wish list is greater product innovation. This will provide more investment avenues to help turn promising, small-scale climate policies or products into mass-effect solutions. Many cities, for example, have pioneered projects that reduce the carbon emissions of waste disposal, or increase funding for greener buildings. Also encouraging is the developing "blue bonds" market, where investor returns are linked to the preservation of specific ecosystems.
This is a pivotal year for climate change. COP 26, held in Glasgow next November, will be crucial for the immediate and long-term future of our planet. We hope that it can point to more concrete achievements than those of the last few years.Daniel Klier is HSBC's group head of sustainable finance

ALP STILL IN A QUANDARY OVER CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY

The opposition sends mixed messages on Pacific Islands demands over coalmining I think most of us get it. Scott Morrison is giving quiet Australians a bit of a break. He reckons many Australians don't need - or indeed appreciate - the Prime Minister lecturing us every night on the television news, particularly on topics that don't concern them.
Last week, several media commentators were dismayed that Morrison had declined to take his riding instructions from the Prime Minister of Tuvalu, population 11,000, to cease any expansion of coalmining in Australia.
Quiet Australians would have expected nothing less from our Prime Minister. The most interesting political aspect of the week, however, was Labor's reaction to the outcome of the Pacific Islands Forum. For a moment there, opposition foreign affairs spokeswoman Penny Wong and deputy opposition leader Richard Marles seemed to forget who won the election.
There was Wong banging on about how Australia had hurt its relationship with the Pacific lslands and the government lacked a credible climate policy. But she then experienced a light-bulb moment and conceded that Labor would not have signed up to the Pacific Islands leaders' demands. "Coal remains an important industry for Australia," she admitted.
Having failed to heed the lesson of Wong's inconsistent performance, Marles continued to put the boot in later in the week. "When the government talks about engaging in a Pacific 'step up', I think we've seen a Pacific stuff-up. You don't get to start in the Pacific unless you have a credible view in respect of climate change." Alas, he forgot the second part of the commentary - that Labor would have acted in the same way as the government. But this is not entirely surprising given Marles's remarks in February: "I mean the global market for thermal coal has collapsed and at one level that's a good thing because what that implies is that the world is acting in relation to climate change." I'm not quite sure where he was getting his information from - maybe he just made it up - but the price of thermal coal was $95 a metric tonne 10 years ago; it is now around $103. But of course old habits die hard and Wong was back to her combative best - or worst - later in the week by referring to leaked material about a meeting between Britain's high commissioner to Australia and two government ministers, Marise Payne and Angus Taylor. According to Wong, "now it's the UK calling on the government to act".
Leaving aside the credibility of the leak, it's not the role of these appointees to be telling other governments how to act. And it was surely ironic that this supposed instruction came in the same week that Britain endured a major blackout not unlike the South Australian experience.
As the result of the combined failure of a gas plant and wind farm to stay connected, large swathes of British households and businesses lost power and more than 700 train trips had to be cancelled after many trains were simply stopped in their tracks.
To be sure, the British government has lofty ambitions when it comes to reducing emissions, having signed on to the pledge to be carbon neutral by 2050, something the EU couldn't agree to.
But the combination of cheap gas, some nuclear power and the failure to count the burning of imported woodchips as emissions-releasing means that Britain can afford to take a purist line at this stage. Future events may alter the government's stance, however.
Getting back to the Australian scene, the comments made in the past week or so have illustrated the quandary in which Labor finds itself when it comes to climate change policy. Research on the election result indicates that Labor's failure to credibly put a costing on its climate action plan penalised it dearly in terms of securing votes.
Recall that Labor's plan involved cutting emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 as well as imposing a renewable energy target on electricity generation of 50 per cent, also by 2030. New vehicle emissions standards were to be imposed (this would have likely led to the closure of our remaining oil refineries, although this was not mentioned) and electrical vehicles were to make up 50 per cent of all new car sales by 2030. There were also some ill-defined proposals to limit land clearing by farmers and to impose emission standards on agriculture, more generally.
It is worth outlining Labor's policy here because it underlines just how radical were the ideas. Note that the use of the Kyoto carry-over - the result of our overachieved emissions reductions from the Kyoto protocols - was ruled out by Labor, although the use of overseas carbon credits was endorsed.
The trouble for Labor, electorally speaking, was twofold: it never demonstrated how it could achieve a cumulative saving of 1.3 billion tonnes of emissions by 2030 and, second, there was no reliable estimate given of the net cost. The opposition leader's response that it was not possible to cost Labor's policies was a serious misstep.
It left the gate open for the Coali-tion to provide its own estimates of the cost of Labor's policies based on commissioned modelling. Figures of a cumulative loss of gross domestic product close to $1.2 billion, real wages lower by 8.5 per cent and 340,000 fewer jobs were sufficient to scare the voting public, particularly as Labor had no effective defence.
So what does the future hold for Labor when it comes to its climate change policy? It's extraordinary that Mark Butler retained his shadow portfolio responsibilities - climate change and energy - given his disastrous performance during the election campaign.
It will clearly not be feasible to retain the 45 per cent emissions target for the next election in 2022. Labor also will have to soften its stance in respect of coalmining and the use of coal, a change that is about to be endorsed by the Queensland division of the Labor Party.
Mind you, this change of direction is not helped by comments by Labor member for Shortland Pat Conroy, who is attempting to hold on to Labor's extreme climate change policy. He dubiously argues that it was the misrepresentation of the "just transition" scheme for displaced coalminers that was to blame for the loss of votes, not the policy itself. The contrast with Joel Fitzgibbon, Labor member for Hunter, could not be more stark. He remarked after the election that Labor made a huge error by not talking about its support for new coal projects.Federal Labor has a lot of soul-searching to do as it comes to grips with its electoral defeat.

Climate change `bigger threat to wildlife than loss of habitat'

CLIMATE change could overtake habitat loss as the biggest cause of species loss, with all land creatures apart from insects severely affected, a world-first study has found.
Australian researchers were surprised at the degree and uniformity of species upheaval after conducting what they say was the first world-scale empirical analysis of the combined impacts of habitat loss and climate change.
``Areas experiencing higher temperatures and drought over time -- these are the most vulnerable,'' said lead researcher Chrystal Mantyka-Pringle of the University of Queensland.
``We thought particular regions might be more vulnerable than others, but we found consistent impacts.''
The team from UQ and the CSIRO reviewed more than 1300 studies of habitat loss around the world during the past two decades, and mapped the impacts on species against changing temperature and rainfall patterns.
The study was designed to provide background information for Ms Mantyka-Pringle's PhD thesis on priority actions to conserve Australian biodiversity. Its report features in the current edition of Global Change Biology.
Ms Mantyka-Pringle said that while habitat loss had been regarded as the biggest factor behind Australian species loss, ``our study shows climate change is exacerbating this impact even further''.
She said the two phenomena could lead to catastrophic results for some populations. ``Serious declines are already a reality for many species. Conservation strategies that don't take into account the combined effects of habitat loss and a changing climate may be ineffective.''
The study found the most important determinant of habitat-loss impacts was maximum temperature, followed by changes in rainfall patterns during the past century. The impacts were greatest in areas with high maximum temperatures and lowest in areas where average rainfall had increased.
Ms Mantyka-Pringle said all terrestrial species including plants and birds were responding similarly, with the exception of arthropods, the taxonomic group that includes insects and spiders.
She said this could be due to the diverse characteristics of arthropods, which constitute more species than any other animal group.
Ms Mantyka-Pringle said species translocation was already occurring, for example among Tasmanian devils and those animals reduced to captive-breeding populations.
She said the study would help identify areas vulnerable to biodiversity loss.
``Australia is a major target. Not only do we have high maximum temperatures, but places like north Queensland, south Western Australia and even Tasmania have suffered from decreased rainfall.''

CUT & PASTE Somebody seems to be in denial about the burning of bush to prepare for bushfires
Prepare for climate change and bushfires! ABC News yesterday: GREENS leader Christine Milne has pointed to the fires in South Australia and Victoria to argue the federal government should do more to prepare for climate change. Senator Milne said the government was failing to recognise the costs of global warming. "Every year we are going to face these extreme weather events, which are going to cost lives and infrastructure, and enough is enough," she said. "The Abbott government has to stop -climate denial and help to get the country prepared to adapt to the more extreme conditions ... for goodness sake abandon your nonsense about climate variability," she said. "Accept global warming is real and let's get on with working together to plan for -resilience in the face of extreme weather events."
Just don't burn off. Paul O'Halloran, Tasmanian Greens health spokesman, March 15, 2011: BURN-OFF practice is outdated, old-school ... "Once again Tasmania's beautiful autumn days are blighted by the dense smoke plumes blocking out the sun and choking our air," Mr O'Halloran said. "This is an unacceptable situation ... We also want to see an end to these burns, and are calling on the minister to ... establish a date by which this polluting practice will end once and for all â€¦ It is also concerning at the impact these burns have on Tasmania's biodiversity and threatened species such as the Tasmanian devil, burrowing and freshwater crayfish, and a myriad of (sic) other plant and animal species. The annual so-called forest regeneration burns have just commenced with Forestry Tasmania alone (sic) intends to conduct 300 coupe burns over five districts, and this will emit copious amounts of carbon dioxide ..., contributing to climate change ..."
Climate change makes flying riskier! Michael Bachelard, The Sydney Morning Herald, January 1: AIRASIA chief executive Tony Fernandes said earlier this week he had "full confidence in my fleet and crew". Without giving details, he steered blame towards the weather, saying his airline would continue business as usual, but suggesting that climate change was making weather worse and flying riskier, particularly in the tropics.
Climate change is making flying riskier? Ronald Bailey, Reason.com, December 29, 2014: THE Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives reports that globally there have been 111 crashes in 2014, the lowest number since 1927.
Kevin Rudd at the National Climate Change Summit, August 6, 2007: CLIMATE change is the great moral challenge of our generation. Climate change is not just an environmental challenge, climate change is an economic challenge, a social challenge, ... Because the dimensions of this challenge are so great, and they reach so far, and they extend over such a wide period of time, and cross so many of traditional portfolio delineations within government and between governments, we should be at a stage now in this country where climate change is beyond politics. None of us individually have the answers - all the answers - on climate change. But -together we can identify the best -answers possible on climate change and that's why we're here.
Kevin Rudd, December 12, 2007: CLIMATE change is the defining challenge of our generation.
Penny Wong, February 6, 2008: CLIMATE change is the challenge of our generation.

Scientists link drought to human-induced climate change

AUSTRALIAN scientists have found an ``amazing'' link between drought in Western Australia and increased snowfall in eastern Antarctica, claiming it as evidence of human-induced climate change.
Analysing a 750-year-old ice core drilled from Law Dome in eastern Antarctica, Australian Antarctic Division glaciologist Tas van Ommen noticed a spike in the heavier snowfalls in the 30 years to 2005.
The big surprise came when he and honorary research fellow Vin Morgan compared the data with weather records in Australia.
``What we found was amazing -- while we were noticing extra moisture in east Antarctica and increasing snowfall, we were seeing dry conditions over southwest Western Australia,'' Dr van Ommen said yesterday.
The research shows that, since the late 1960s, there has been a 15-20 per cent drop in winter rainfall in southwest Western Australia, while at the same time there has been a 10 per cent increase in snowfall at Law Dome.
Dr van Ommen said the work, published in the Nature Geoscience journal, pointed to a change in the atmospheric circulation patterns south of Australia.
``In the past three decades, the strength of persistent high- and low-pressure systems off southern Australia have increased, directing more warm moist air south towards the coast of Antarctica, and dry cold air north (towards southwest Western Australia) in winter,'' he said. The change was so far outside the normal variations that he believed this was probably caused by human-induced climate change.
``This does not appear to be in the range of normal variability: we can see from the ice core that an event like the increased snowfall at Law Dome would only come along once every 38,000 years without some change in climate patterns,'' Dr van Ommen said. ``And given the connection we see in Western Australia, it would suggest the drought is also not a natural event.''
The findings were ``another very important'' piece of evidence of human-induced climate change, he said, but he welcomed scientific scrutiny. The bad news was that modelling showed no sign of the pattern changing.

It seems Barack Obama is somewhat alone on how to power development
TONY Abbott is trying to change the conversation on climate change. Rather than be on the defensive, the Prime Minister is taking the initiative and this week was first to raise the issue of climate change with French President Francois Hollande, who hosts the climate change conference in Paris next December.
Abbott publicly disclosed he'd raised climate change with Hollande at their Wednesday meeting and appeared almost zealous in his determination not to see another failure like the Copenhagen conference in 2009, which contributed mightily to the decline of Kevin Rudd and started the former PM's retreat from the "greatest moral challenge of our time".
"I think it's very important that we don't have another disaster like Copenhagen and it's vital that the Paris conference be a success, unlike Copenhagen, and for it to be a success, we can't pursue environmental improvements at the expense of economic progress. We can't reduce emissions in ways which cost jobs, because it will fail if that's what we end up trying to do," Abbott said with the French President at his side.
Hollande said that after the failure of Copenhagen "we have evolved in our way of thinking" and pointed to the need for legally binding global agreements.
But what was not disclosed publicly was that Hollande observed to Abbott that the French and other European residents were in no position or had no appetite for any "tax" or rise in electricity prices. It would seem it is not just Australian leaders who may be susceptible to a campaign against a carbon tax.
The shift in focus to providing energy security and making energy use more efficient was at the heart of the G20 plans of Joe Hockey and Abbott for the past year. The Brisbane summit was the first to have a leaders' session at the G20 on energy security.
Abbott's positive declaration on the need for targets and targets that are achieved coming out of Paris was not the thinking of a new zealot on climate change but the recognition that the climate change debate has to be managed. Previously, the Coalition has lost climate change fights which were ideologically based.
Overwhelmingly, people rightfully believe in climate change; a majority is concerned about the impact of climate change and a smaller majority believes human activities contribute to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions. When Rudd portrayed John Howard and Abbott as sceptics and "climate change deniers", he won the political debate. But when the argument came down to how climate change would be addressed practically, it was Abbott who won the argument against Julia Gillard and the carbon tax.
It is here that Abbott is seeking to return to familiar and successful ground, where he argues for reaching Australia's global targets while not harming the Australian economy, risking jobs or putting up electricity prices, which have fallen since the repeal of the carbon tax.
Abbott is choosing not to be seen as backward on climate change, just pragmatic and practical. It's a mood that seems to be taking root outside Australia as well.
"This government has just passed through the parliament legislation to put into effect our emissions reduction fund - a $2.5 billion fund. So, we aren't just talking about taking action against climate change; we are cracking on with the job. And, yes, we've got a 5 per cent of 2000 by 2020 target that we will achieve but that is actually a 19 per cent reduction on business as usual.
"So, Australia is a high performer when it comes to actually delivering on real action to tackle climate change," he said at the end of the G20 and has repeated often since as he tried to counteract US President Barack Obama's public statements.
Last Saturday, in a tactless act of political bastardry, Obama put climate change, and specifically the ideological and emotional -arguments, centre stage at the G20 summit. Acknowledging the "debate" in Australia, the US President cited potential damage to Queensland's Great Barrier Reef and campaigned against Queensland's great export of coal.
"I have not had a chance to go to the Great Barrier Reef and I want to come back, and I want my daughters to be able to come back, and I want them to be able to bring their daughters or sons to visit," the President said.
He also said there should be support for the Green Climate Fund, to which he has pledged $3bn, to help developing countries "leapfrog some of the dirty industries that powered our development; go straight to a clean-energy economy that allows them to grow, create jobs, and at the same time reduce their carbon pollution". "It allows us to help developing countries break out of this false choice between development and pollution," he said.
Promoting the agreement between China and the US on carbon emission reductions, Obama pushed to the forefront climate change and the success the US has had in reducing carbon emissions.
In the closed energy session and at the end of the summit, -Abbott started to push back on job creation, support for the ongoing role of coal in world development and the inequity of the advanced world, which has produced most of the carbon emissions, denying one-fifth of the world's population access to electricity.
"Leaders agreed that the issue of energy requires a significant ongoing focus," he said.
"We endorsed landmark energy principles which will ensure access to affordable and reliable energy for all. They will ensure that energy institutions are more inclusive of emerging and developing economies. They will strengthen energy markets, enhance energy security, phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption and, importantly, they will support sustainable growth and development." Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was sympathetic to Abbott's position and in parliament combined some of the emotional argument about climate change and India with the burgeoning demand for Australia's cleaner coal and uranium by calling for new-generation energy "that does not cause our glaciers to melt".
Chinese President Xi Jinping did not even mention climate change in his historic and wide-ranging address to parliament, which contrasted sharply with Obama's deliberate act at the University of Queensland.
Xi, unlike Obama, seemed more realistic in his pursuit of the publicity for his agreement with the US, in which China aspires to have carbon emissions begin to level off and peak by around 2030. China's expectation is built on continuing massive carbon emissions, an expansion of its coal-fired powered energy, nuclear reactors and hydro-electricity, coupled with a levelling off of its population.
Much of what China has said will happen is based on natural development and technological advance and no national emissions trading scheme.
Likewise, Obama's pride in what the US has achieved so far is based on the growth in shale gas production in the US, using fracking, which has quadrupled in the past five years, cut the gas price to a quarter of what it was and opened capacity for US companies to reach record levels of coal exports. For the past two years, coal diverted from US power stations that have switched to shale gas has been competing on the world market with coal from Queensland.Abbott took a hit from Obama last Saturday in the headlines on climate change but if Hollande's feeling about the fear of rising taxes and power prices in Europe is right, it's more likely the attitudes of Xi and Modi will prevail.

The international body's real agenda is a new world order under its control
It's a well-kept secret, but 95 per cent of the climate models we are told prove the link between human CO2 emissions and catastrophic global warming have been found, after nearly two decades of temperature stasis, to be in error. It's not surprising.
We have been subjected to extravagance from climate catastrophists for close to 50 years.
In January 1970, Life magazine, based on "solid scientific evidence", claimed that by 1985 air pollution would reduce the sunlight reaching the Earth by half. In fact, across that period sunlight fell by between 3 per cent and 5 per cent. In a 1971 speech, Paul Ehrlich said: "If I were a gambler I would take even money that -England will not exist in the year 2000." Fast forward to March 2000 and David Viner, senior research scientist at the Climatic Research Unit, University of East Anglia, told The Independent, "Snowfalls are now a thing of the past." In December 2010, the Mail Online reported, "Coldest December since records began as temperatures plummet to minus 10C bringing travel chaos across Britain".
We've had our own busted predictions. Perhaps the most preposterous was climate alarmist Tim Flannery's 2005 observation: "If the computer records are right, these drought conditions will become permanent in eastern Australia." Subsequent rainfall and severe flooding have shown the records or his analysis are wrong. We've swallowed dud prediction after dud prediction. What's more, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which we were instructed was the gold standard on global warming, has been exposed repeatedly for -mis-rep-resentation and shoddy methods.
Weather bureaus appear to have "homogenised" data to suit narratives. NASA's claim that 2014 was the warmest year on record was revised, after challenge, to only 38 per cent probability. Extreme weather events, once blamed on global warming, no longer are, as their frequency and intensity decline.
Why then, with such little evidence, does the UN insist the world spend hundreds of billions of dollars a year on futile climate change policies? Perhaps Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN's Framework on Climate Change has the answer?
In Brussels last February she said, "This is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task of intentionally, within a defined period of time, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years since the Industrial Revolution." In other words, the real agenda is concentrated political authority. Global warming is the hook.
Figueres is on record saying democracy is a poor political system for fighting global warming. Communist China, she says, is the best model. This is not about facts or logic. It's about a new world order under the control of the UN. It is opposed to capitalism and freedom and has made environmental catastrophism a household topic to achieve its objective.
Figueres says that, unlike the Industrial Revolution, "This is a centralised transformation that is taking place." She sees the US partisan divide on global warming as "very detrimental". Of course. In her authoritarian world there will be no room for debate or -disagreement.
Make no mistake, climate change is a must-win battlefield for authoritarians and fellow travellers. As Timothy Wirth, president of the UN Foundation, says: "Even if the -(climate change) theory is wrong, we will be doing the right thing in terms of economic and environmental policy." Having gained so much ground, eco-catastrophists won't let up. After all, they have captured the UN and are extremely well funded. They have a hugely powerful ally in the White House. They have successfully enlisted compliant academics and an obedient and gullible mainstream media (the ABC and Fairfax in Australia) to push the scriptures regardless of evidence.
They will continue to present the climate change movement as an independent, spontaneous consensus of concerned scientists, politicians and citizens who believe human activity is "extremely likely" to be the dominant cause of global warming. ("Extremely likely" is a scientific term?) And they will keep mobilising public opinion using fear and appeals to morality. UN support will be assured through promised wealth redistribution from the West, even though its anti-growth policy prescriptions will needlessly prolong poverty, hunger, sickness and illiteracy for the world's poorest.
Figueres said at a climate -summit in Melbourne recently that she was "truly counting on Australia's leadership" to ensure most coal stayed in the ground.
Hopefully, like India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Tony Abbott isn't listening. India knows the importance of cheap energy and is set to overtake China as the world's leading importer of coal. Even Germany is about to commission the most coal-fired power stations in 20 years.
There is a real chance Figueres and those who share her centralised power ambitions will succeed. As the UN's December climate change conference in Paris approaches, Australia will be pressed to sign even more futile job-destroying climate change treaties.
Resisting will be politically difficult. But resist we should. We are already paying an unnecessary social and economic price for empty gestures. Enough is enough.Maurice Newman is chairman of the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Council. The views expressed here are his own.

Woodside, Santos feel the climate change heat

Energy producers Woodside Petroleum and Santos face a new wave of climate change activism as investors call for two of Australia's largest oil and gas players to lower emissions to meet Paris climate targets.
The Climate Action 100+ initiative, which controls $US32 trillion ($45 trillion) in global investment and is backed by major Australian superannuation funds, will hold talks with the two companies in coming weeks about their commitment and accountability on climate change issues after reporting earnings last month.
"We meet with them, we engage with them, look at what their public disclosures are and their reporting and we review their performance," said Emma Herd, a member of the Climate Action 100+ steering committee.
Companies will be assessed against a global benchmarking model developed with other green groups, with a final report due in August on their performance.
Woodside and Santos are among 13 prominent Australian businesses under pressure on climate change as institutional investors flex their muscles to hold companies to account and improve their environmental performance.
Australia's largest coal producer, Glencore, shocked markets last week after deciding to abandon the pursuit of large coal acquisitions and freeze production at current levels to help address climate change concerns following pressure from Climate Action 100+.
Its members in Australia include AustralianSuper, AMP Capital, Cbus, IFM Investors, QSuper and BT Financial Group.
A linked lobby group will also step up its engagement with Woodside and Santos today by calling on each company to disclose its strategy to cut emissions and review its membership of industry associations that obstruct climate policy in Australia.
Shareholder resolutions have been filed with the two energy producers by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility and super fund Australian Ethical, following talks which concluded the companies had failed to commit to credible decarbonisation plans.
The boards of Woodside and Santos have been asked to disclose how their capital spending aligns with Paris climate goals, their targets for reducing emissions and details of how their remuneration policies will incentivise progress measured against the targets.
"Shareholders are concerned that our company has not disclosed a strategy to align its business with a pathway consistent with the Paris Agreement," the ACCR says. "The failure to match the ambition recently shown by our company's global peers, namely Shell and BP which, we are concerned, would render Australian oil and gas companies global laggards." Woodside boss Peter Coleman dedicated a November speech largely to the threat of climate change, saying Australia had all the resources it needed to support a lower-carbon society, and do so in an internationally competitive way that ensured continued jobs and growth.
Woodside, Shell and BHP have also called for a carbon price to be introduced by the federal government.Santos released its climate change report last week, saying it was poised to play a leading role in "significant emissions reductions".

Debate reignited over the role climate change plays in fires

Bushfires ravaging large areas near the Queensland-NSW border are not unprecedented for this time of year but have renewed -debate over whether climate change has contributed to the blazes.
Greens leader Richard Di Natale told ABC radio on Monday the fires were "more evidence we are in climate crisis, facing a -climate emergency".
He said firefighters across the country were calling for more renewable energy and less coal to fight climate change. "We know from the science that as a result of climate change we will see increased frequency and severity of bushfires," Senator Di Natale said.
"We know that climate change makes bushfires worse in the same way we know that lax gun laws make gun violence worse." Federal Natural Disaster Minister David Littleproud said whether or not the fires were the result of climate change was irrelevant. He said Senator Di Natale was a "fringe dweller" for claiming Mr Littleproud was "endangering Australians" by not addressing climate change.
Acting Queensland Premier Jackie Trad said the fires, which have so far destroyed 12 homes in that state, could be linked to climate change. "The early onset of the fire season this year is something unprecedented and historic," Ms Trad said on Monday.
The fires have been fanned by strong winds in areas that have experienced an extended period of drought. Bureau of Meteorology manager of climate monitoring Karl Braganza said over recent days parts of northeast NSW and southeast Queensland had seen unusually high temperatures, very low humidity and gusty winds leading to dangerous fire conditions.
"The fire risk has been exacerbated by severe ongoing dry conditions, with many locations in the affected regions experiencing year-to-date rainfall totals 50 per cent below average, and some -locations their driest year-to-date on record," he said.
Low rainfall patterns were being influenced by a positive Indian Ocean dipole, in which warmer sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean relative to the east results in less rainfall over southern Australia and the Top End.
Records dispute Ms Trad's claims that the current fires are unprecedented. The Morning Bulletin newspaper on August 16, 1953, detailed bushfires raging over many parts of southeast Queensland, whipped up by gale-force winds.
Two years earlier, on October 4, 1951, what were claimed to be the worst bushfires in the state's history burnt out one million hectares of sheep, cattle and farm country.Newspaper reports at the time said fires between Stanthorpe and Brisbane destroyed telephone communications and thick smoke interrupted commercial airlines.

BHP tips renewables to grow in its climate change update

BHP Billiton has identified stronger growth in renewables and the rise of electric vehicles as key changes in the past 12 months in its long-term business impact assessment of climate change policies.
The changes were identified in an update of last year's climate change portfolio analysis by the world's biggest resources group, and comes in the wake of December's Paris agreement for action to limit global warming to well below 2C.
"The emissions intensity of the global economy is decreasing compared with a business-as-usual case, a trend which started even before the Paris agreement was adopted," BHP said.
"However, over the past year, a number of signals have emerged which suggest that the world is continuing its transition towards lower emissions energy.
"Two key growth areas are prevalent: lower emissions power generation (renewables) and increasing electric vehicle penetration," BHP said.
The disruptive potential of renewable power generation in particular has got BHP's interest up. The miner has signed a knowledge sharing agreement covering the Lakeland solar and lithium-ion battery storage project in far north Queensland.
BHP wants to learn from the 13MW solar plant, with its 5.3MW of battery storage on the edge of the Queensland grid, whether the power storage technology can change the way its remote operations are powered, as well as delivering discrete security of supply by being off grid.
Somewhat ironically, BHP has been waiting on grid power supplies to be restored to its Olympic Dam mine after South Australia's black out last month. The role of the intermittent nature of renewables in the blackout of the grid is being investigated.
BHP became involved in Lakeland in August. Construction starts new month on the flagship project which has federal government funding, with Origin the offtake partner.
Ahead of the release of its -climate change update yesterday, BHP vice-president for sustainability and climate change Fiona Wild said BHP took climate change seriously.
"Portfolio analysis is an ongoing part of the way we operate and climate change is fully integrated into our strategic planning processes and investment decision making," Dr Wild said.
She said that BHP had re-tested its business portfolio and strategy in light of climate change action in the past 12 months and "determined that our commodities have strong future margins, and our portfolio remains resilient.".
"We are well placed to manage transition to a 2C outcome, and as part of our integrated approach to climate change risk management, we are taking action, and we will continue to advocate for a strong global response," Dr Wild said.She said BHP's ability to test and adjust its portfolio, such as buying and selling assets, meant it was "well positioned to continue to add value as external factors change".

Local government in the deep end - Special Report: Climate Change and Water

LOCAL governments, by providing many of the essentials for everyday living, are at the sharp-end of temperature changes, increasing water levels, drought and storms. Councils around Australia must ensure their regions adapt to climate change through planning and building initiatives, and also mitigate greenhouse emissions.
In Sydney, Manly Council's general manager Henry Wong says that by its nature local government is in the eye of the climate change storm. ``I don't know of any other level of government closer to (the potential effects of climate change) than we are, because we deal with everyone's daily livelihoods and daily lives,'' he says. ``Other levels of government talk about megabucks but at the end of the day they don't deal with the day-to-day stuff that local governments have to deal with.''
Once known just as the realm of roads, rubbish and rates, local councils have taken an increasingly sophisticated role in their residents' lives. For almost two decades climate change has been on the local government map.
While conservation has been embraced by many local councils since the 1960s, it took the 1990 establishment of the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives -- Local Governments for Sustainability to put climate change firmly on the agenda.
Since then the Australian Local Government Association (ALGA) has liaised with overseas organisations and regularly called on the federal government to shoulder its international responsibilities on meeting climate change challenges.
ALGA president Paul Bell says for some time councils have heard the message ``think global, act local'' loud and clear. However, he says to ensure a greater response there needs to be more co-operative agreements between federal, state and local governments to ensure planning with certainty.
``In the absence of agreement at the inter-governmental level on issues such as the level and extent of likely coastal water changes, we are seeing conflicting decisions being taken by councils compared to the states (through institutions such as CSIRO, Geoscience Australia and universities),'' Bell says.
While there may be lapses in co-operation between different levels of government, local councils have embarked on their own projects.
``There is increasing recognition of the need for adaptation strategies to allow communities to deal with the effects of climate change and reduce exposure to the possible impacts,'' Bell says.
Council reactions to the challenge have been varied, especially considering tight budgetary constraints and the potential political fallout over increasing rates to pay for climate change initiatives.
However, despite reluctance by some sections of the community, councils have acted to adapt to climate change and mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions.
``At the council level, measures can be implemented such as increasing the efficiency of lighting, alternative technology for heating, cooling and water treatment plants, vehicle downsizing and fuel conversions, promote climate friendly built and natural environments through strategic planning, development assessment and building control practices,'' Bell says.
``At the wider community level, councils can undertake environmental education and awareness-raising, promote energy efficiency in residential, industrial and commercial settings, promote alternative methods of transport, and provide and promote alternative waste management services and policies such as recycling of household waste, composting and zero-waste policies.
``Local government activities that are likely to be directly impacted by climate change include planning existing and future developments and community infrastructure, which would be affected by sea level and water table rises and storm surges. There will also be impacts on natural resources, health and building regulations and community infrastructure and services.''
To assist in preparing for climate change many councils have sought help from the private sector which, from the outside, can provide a holistic approach to the problem.
Seaside municipalities in particular are vulnerable to increases in water levels and storm activity wrought by climate change.
Initiatives include coastal protection programs, landfill solutions, beachfront stabilisation and the building of sea walls and levies. Manly is one seaside council which has recognised its vulnerability.
The council has liaised with infrastructure services provider Cardno to map out a comprehensive response to climate change.
Cardno Infrastructure Services NSW sustainability and climate change manager Louise Collier says it was a case of looking at a whole spectrum of climate change potential.
``This total service is invaluable because the nature of climate change spans a range of disciplines. So in order to be able to plan across all disciplines, many councils outsource expertise to create a model,'' she says.
``So we have people like coastal engineers, drainage engineers and water engineers -- the full spectrum of people that we can pull in as part of a multi-disciplinary team. Local government, I guess, doesn't necessarily have access to those levels of specialists.''
Henry Wong says climate change has been firmly on the agenda in Manly since the Kyoto Protocol and council has been steadily including provisions in building and infrastructure planning He says it has been important to keep the community informed, especially considering the potential vulnerability of Manly to rising oceans. ``We are certainly concerned about protecting the low areas of Manly from the effects of sea levels rising, and there is also the question of storm intensity getting greater,'' Wong says.
``Some of the areas are 1-2m above the current high-water mark. Cardno modelled for seas rising, which doesn't take into consideration storm surges. So we are keen to ensure our community is fully informed of their vulnerability and prepare accordingly in relation to building standards. But to put in a coastal protection strategy for Manly, even though we are looking at a 1-in-a-1000 chance, will cost us mega bucks.''
In the September local government elections Manly residents were asked if they wanted an environmental levy averaging $1 a week. But with the possibility of a global recession looming, in contrast to an earlier supportive survey 60 per cent of residents rejected the initiative.
``My council is highly aware of the current economic situation and certainly no government would like to introduce levies and taxes at a time of great financial uncertainties,'' Wong says. ``However, the costs of not doing something would be far more than us doing our little bit to help the environment.''

TIDE TURNING ON CLIMATE CHANGE

A green race has started and governments are keen to compete
THE Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change today will release the most comprehensive study on global warming. The landmark study, prepared by more than 200 scientists across two years, reportedly will conclude that global temperatures could rise by up to 4.8C by the end of this century compared with pre-industrial levels, but potentially could still be held to 0.3Cwith deep, speedy cuts in emissions.
This is hugely significant because all countries have agreed that temperature rises should be restricted to no more than 2C, thus increasing prospects of preventing so-called dangerous or runaway climate change.
The study reportedly also will conclude that it is ``extremely likely'' (at least 95 per cent probability) that human activity, not climate variations, has caused most of the increase in global temperature in recent decades.
A key reason the IPCC report is attracting such enormous media scrutiny is that climate change sceptics, in particular, are looking to see how the report explains the fact the rate of increase in global average surface temperature has slowed for the past 1 1/2 decades. This is contrary to earlier IPCC predictions.
Despite the controversy it will cause with sceptics, the IPCC report will be welcomed by many across the world, and comes when it may seem hard not to be pessimistic about the global battle to manage the huge risks of climate change.
For instance, the last annual UN international climate change summit in Doha in December made only modest progress towards securing a comprehensive, global deal.
Moreover, climate change sceptics appear to be winning the battle for public opinion across much of the world. Earlier this month, for instance, one study showed that the percentage of British people who do not think the world's climate is changing had increased by a staggering fourfold in less than a decade.
However, far from being the hopeless situation some suggest, there are signs that we may be reaching a point when the tide turns on tackling climate change. To be sure, much more needs to be done, but if one takes a step back and examines what is already happening at national and sub-national level across the world, a relatively encouraging picture is emerging.
That is, domestic laws and regulations to address climate change are being passed at an increasing rate, in stark contrast to the pace of progress in UN-driven international negotiations. Last year alone, as described in a report published by GLOBE International, 32 of 33 surveyed countries (which account for more than 85 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions), including the US and China, have introduced or are progressing significant climate or related legislation and regulation.
This is nothing less than a game-changing development:
* China, after the publication of its 12th five-year plan in 2011, has proceeded with more detailed implementation guidelines including rules for its emissions trading pilots, progress with drafting its climate change law and publication of an energy white paper. Moreover, at the end of October last year, sub-national legislation was passed in Shenzhen to tackle climate change, the first such legislation in China.
* Mexico has passed a general law on climate change that is a comprehensive legislative framework packaged together with the first Redd+ readiness legislation to tackle deforestation.
* South Korea passed legislation to begin a nationwide emissions trading scheme by 2015.
* South Africa has proposed a carbon tax.
* There has also been progress in the developed world. For instance, the EU passed a new directive on energy efficiency, and Germany strengthened legislation relating to carbon capture and storage and energy efficiency.
As these examples underline, it is mainly developing countries, which will provide the motor of global economic growth in coming decades, that are leading this drive. Many are concluding it is in their national interest to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by embracing low-carbon growth and development, and to better prepare for the impact of climate change.
They see that expanding domestic sources of renewable energy not only reduces emissions but also increases energy security by reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels. Reducing energy demand through greater efficiency reduces costs and increases competitiveness. Improving resilience to the effects of climate change also makes sound economic sense.
Many governments and companies have recognised that a green race has started, and they are determined to compete.
They also acknowledge that, across time, those that produce in ``dirty'' ways will be increasingly likely to face border adjustment mechanisms that take account of the subsidy associated with their taking advantage of any unpriced pollution.
It follows, therefore, that advancing domestic legislation on climate change, and experiencing the co-benefits of reducing emissions, is a crucial building block to help create the political conditions to enable a comprehensive, global climate agreement to be reached. Domestic laws give clear signals about direction of policy, increasing confidence and reducing uncertainty, particularly for the private sector, which can drive low-carbon economic growth.
With negotiations on a post-2020 comprehensive global deal scheduled to conclude in 2015, it is unlikely that an agreement, with necessary ambition, will be reached unless more domestic frameworks are in place in key countries. Sound domestic actions enhance the prospects of international action and better international prospects enhance domestic actions.
Given this outlook, and as negotiators prepare for the next annual UN climate change summit in Poland in November, a potential danger is that some countries may lower their long-term ambition. This would be ill-timed. Indeed, now is the right moment for countries to invest more in tackling climate change to help expedite the creation of conditions on the ground that will enable a comprehensive global treaty to be reached.

Bob Carter: 'rationalist' critic of climate change

Bob Carter, outspoken critic of the catastrophic global warming theory, did not like the term sceptic.
Professor Carter, who died in Townsville on Tuesday from a heart attack, considered himself a rationalist, and popular usage of the term "climate change" a tautology. As he wrote frequently: the geological record tells us that climate always changes.
In Professor Carter's passing, we have lost a person who believed in value-free science.
When he was still directing the Marine Geophysical Laboratory at James Cook University, Professor Carter spent an evening with me at his home in Townsville poring over a single chart that was a proxy record of New Zealand's climate over the past several thousand years. The time series data had been printed out on a long and continuous roll of paper: longer than the kitchen table so the end of the chart, that portion representing the present, was often dangling somewhere near the floor.
Professor Carter was always more interested in periods of dramatic climate change, particularly the Younger Dryas. The Younger Dryas occurred about 14,500 years ago, with an article in the Journal of Geophysical Research suggesting Greenland's temperature rose 10C (18F) in a decade. Professor Carter was reluctant to endorse such a dramatic temperature increase, but always emphasised that relative to geological history, late 20th-century rates of warming of less than 2C per century, were not unusual.
Professor Carter was a real expert on climate change. He was director of the Australian Office of the Ocean Drilling Program, an international co-operative effort to collect deep sea cores. From these cores, past climates for specific regions have been reconstructed.
We both presented to the Coalition environment committee at Parliament House on October 20 last year. Professor Carter eloquently explained, with examples, how modern temperatures were not unusually warm; that current carbon dioxide levels were low relative to geological time; that as industrial emissions were added to the atmosphere, the less was the "greenhouse" warming effect of each increment of carbon dioxide. Therefore, he concluded, "dangerous warming of this causation will not occur".
Furthermore, he added, the addition of 50ppm of CO2 for 1981-2010 had fertilised an 11 per cent increase in plant cover. Thus CO2 was both a strong environmental (greening the planet) and agrarian (crop yield increases) benefit.
In this presentation, he also emphasised the importance of the scientific method. "To the extent that it is possible for any human endeavour to be so, science is value-free. Science is a way of attempting to understand the world in which we live from a rational point of view, based on observation, experiment and tested theory. Irritatingly, especially for governments, science does not operate by con-sensus and it is often best progres-sed by mavericks. The alternat-ive to a scientific approach is one based on super-stition, phobia, religion or politics." So wrote Professor Carter in an article titled Science is not Consensus, published by the Institute of Public Affairs in December 2003.
In the preface to his first book Climate: The Counter Consensus, he encouraged us all to "trust authority less and our own brains more" as we assessed the likely dangers of both known natural and hypothetical human-caused global climate change. Chapter 11 of this book outlined the real and present dangers posed by natural climate change. We are reminded of 1816, known as "the year without a summer" for its intense cold associated with both the Dalton solar minimum and a super-eruption of the Indonesian volcano Tambora.
Professor Carter understood such events were often associated with extreme hardship and famine, and that, to the extent possible, nations should use their resources to mitigate against such catastrophe. In particular, he advocated what he referred to as Plan B: that future climate hazards, both natural and possibly human-caused, be assessed in terms of risk that vary in type and intensity from geographic place to place.
Putting in place policies and plans to prepare for natural climate change would, Professor Carter argued, make us ready for human-caused climate change, should it ever become manifest.
Even with generous funding for national hazard warning and disaster relief schemes, he concluded his book with the comment that this would cost orders of magnitude less than the introduction of unnecessary and ineffectual emissions trading schemes.
Professor Carter's funeral will be held in Townsville on Monday.Academic, blogger and author Jennifer Marohasy is a senior research fellow at the Institute of Public Affairs

Professor Carter eloquently explained, with examples, how modern temperatures were not unusually warm; that current carbon dioxide levels were low relative to geological time; that as industrial emissions were added to the atmosphere, the less was the "greenhouse" warming effect of each increment of carbon dioxide. Therefore, he concluded, "dangerous warming of this causation will not occur".
Furthermore, he added, the addition of 50ppm of CO2 for 1981-2010 had fertilised an 11 per cent increase in plant cover. Thus CO2 was both a strong environmental (greening the planet) and agrarian (crop yield increases) benefit.
In this presentation, he also emphasised the importance of the scientific method. "To the extent that it is possible for any human endeavour to be so, science is value-free. Science is a way of attempting to understand the world in which we live from a rational point of view, based on observation, experiment and tested theory. Irritatingly, especially for governments, science does not operate by consensus and it is often best progressed by mavericks. The alternative to a scientific approach is one based on superstition, phobia, religion or politics." So wrote Professor Carter in an article titled Science is not Consensus, published by the Institute of Public Affairs in December 2003.
In the preface to his first book Climate: The Counter Consensus, he encouraged us all to "trust authority less and our own brains more" as we assessed the likely dangers of both known natural and hypothetical human-caused global climate change. Chapter 11 of this book outlined the real and present dangers posed by natural climate change. We are reminded of 1816, known as "the year without a summer" for its intense cold associated with both the Dalton solar minimum and a super-eruption of the Indonesian volcano Tambora.
Professor Carter understood such events were often associated with extreme hardship and famine, and that, to the extent possible, nations should use their resources to mitigate against such catastrophe. In particular, he advocated what he referred to as Plan B: that future climate hazards, both natural and possibly human-caused, be assessed in terms of risk that vary in type and intensity from geographic place to place.
"Nobody," he would joke, "lives in a world climate." Putting in place policies and plans to prepare for natural climate change would, Professor Carter argued, make us ready for human-caused climate change, should it ever become manifest.
Even with generous funding for national hazard warning and disaster relief schemes, he concluded his book with the comment that this would cost orders of magnitude less than the introduction of unnecessary and ineffectual emissions trading schemes.

Finance sector fears climate change: APRA

A third of the 40 largest Australian banks, insurance companies and superannuation funds believe climate change is an immediate "material financial risk" to their businesses while a further 20 companies believe it will be a risk in the future, according to the prudential regulator.
In the first survey of its kind, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority found all of the 38 large institutions it surveyed were taking steps to understand the threat of climate change, with most banks considering climate-related financial risks as part of their management frameworks.
It comes hot on the heels of a declaration last week from Reserve Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle that climate change and the conversion to a low-carbon economy or a world with more erratic weather events would have "first-order economic effects" that required an immediate but orderly transition to ensure financial stability.
Yesterday, shares in Melbourne-based agricultural chemical company Nufarm plunged 24 per cent in a $400 million crash after being hit by the prolonged east coast drought, supply chain disruptions and improved Chinese environmental standards in the wake of pressure on China's government to tackle pollution.
"The reality is last year was the worst drought in 100 years, and we have had one of the hottest summers in 100 years," said Nufarm boss Greg Hunt.
According to APRA's survey released yesterday, four of seven large banks said energy-related risks were the most pertinent, while one bank said rising sea levels was its highest risk. Insurance companies were most concerned by physical risks, such as floods and cyclones. Life insurance companies were concerned by the greater risk of heat stress for customers, along with floods and regulatory changes.
APRA executive board member Geoff Summerhayes said the regulator was responsible for ensuring financial companies were aware of the issues that could affect their ability to fulfil contracts with customers.
"The world is rapidly transitioning to a low-carbon economy, driven principally by the decisions of governments, business leaders, investors and consumers. Companies that fail to respond to these forces risk being left behind," Mr Summerhayes said, noting APRA's views were consistent with those of international financial regulators.
"These risks are material, foreseeable and actionable now. Uncertainty over long-term impacts or policy direction is not an excuse for doing nothing," Mr Summerhayes said.
In a landmark speech in Sydney last week, Mr Debelle said the RBA was using climate change data in its macroeconomic models and had joined a global group of central banks called the Network for Greening the Financial System to better understand the impact of a warming planet.
The current drought in Australia has cut farm output by 6 per cent and reduced economic growth by 0.15 per cent, a drag on the economy, Mr Debelle said would continue this year.
APRA said reputational damage, flooding, regulatory changes and cyclones were the top climate-related financial risks.
The physical risks presented by climate change, such as greater damage caused to assets and property from extreme weather events, impact the economy and financial markets through supply chain disruption, lower productivity and falling asset prices. Transition risks as the business world adjusts to a lower-carbon environment involve companies being vulnerable to changes to regulation, technological obsolescence and also legal risks from the prospect of boards ignoring the risks climate change presents.
"There is a high degree of certainty that financial risks will materialise, and entities can mitigate the magnitude of the impacts of these risks through action in the short term," APRA said."Similarly, APRA has noted that it is imprudent for entities or regulators to ignore such risks just because there is uncertainty, or even controversy, about the policy outlook."

'No reason for climate change measures to hurt growth'

Global governments that take a "timid" response to tackling climate change represent a bigger risk to economic growth than -implementing firm emissions -reduction policies, economists have warned.
On the heels of a landmark paper released by the Bank for International Settlements that warned the next financial crisis could be triggered by "green swan" events linked to wild fluctuations in asset prices vulnerable to climate change, an analysis from Capital Economics chief analyst Neil Shearing said there was "no reason" to believe that taking steps to combat climate change necessarily required sacrificing economic growth.
"Most analyses start from the assumption that there is a trade-off between economic growth and efforts to tackle climate change," Mr Shearing said.
"Instead, the bigger risk in our view is that the response by world leaders is too timid, in which case emerging markets would again be the hardest hit. Greener growth doesn't necessarily mean slower growth." Josh Frydenberg on Tuesday said Australian financial regulators were keenly focused on climate change but "a balanced approach" that considered emissions reduction, adaptation, mitigation and resilience was needed to ensure the continued strength of the economy.
The Treasurer said the Reserve Bank, APRA and ASIC had all talked about the importance of climate change. "The Australian economy continues to grow and continues to be remarkably resilient in the face of not just the bushfires, but the comprehensive drought that we have seen, as well as the global trade tensions," he said. On Tuesday a global survey of the oil and gas industry by international risk management firm GNV GL found that Australian oil and gas executives were more optimistic about the prospect for the industry's growth than the rest of the world.
Australian executives were also "less likely than the global -average to want their organisation to move faster to decarbonise", but were twice as likely to consider investing in renewables and clean energy due to concerns about their company's reputation and brand.
It comes as recent natural disasters continue to plague local businesses. Mining giant BHP said on Tuesday that poor air quality caused by smoke from Australia's bushfires was hurting coal production in NSW, while insurers are bracing for an estimated $320m worth of losses caused by hail storms that struck eastern Melbourne, the Australian Capital Territory and parts of NSW on Sunday and Monday.
Mr Shearing's colleague, Capital Economic's chief Australian analyst Marcel Thieliant, said -efforts to combat global warming would "probably" do less damage to Australia's economy than is often believed.
"The bulk of Australia's coal exports are metallurgical coal and China's shift to electric arc furnaces for steelmaking may reduce demand for coking coal," Mr -Thieliant said.
"But thermal coal, which is used to generate electricity, accounted for just 9 per cent of resources exports. And the key point is that concerns about greenhouse gas emissions are boosting demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), whose share in resources exports has surged from 6 per cent a decade ago to 18 per cent in 2018-19," Mr -Thieliant added.
The Bank of International Settlements, which represents the world's central banks, urged members to "be more proactive" in pushing politicians and government to grapple with the necessary transition to a greener economy, labelling a global tax on carbon a "first-best solution".It also urged governments to steer businesses towards -accounting for climate-related risks in investment decisions in a move that would act as "a form of shadow pricing on carbon".
