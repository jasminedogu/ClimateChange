Judge Amy Coney Barrett refused to answer numerous questions, but it was her avoidance of acknowledging climate change that particularly resonated.
During two grueling days of questioning over her Supreme Court confirmation, Judge Amy Coney Barrett did her best to avoid controversy. But her efforts to play it safe on the subject of climate change have created perhaps the most tangible backlash of her hearings.
In her responses, the nominee to take the place of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an environmental stalwart, used language that alarmed some environmentalists and suggested rough going for initiatives to fight climate change, if as expected she wins confirmation and cements a 6-3 conservative majority on the court.
On Thursday, the last of four days of confirmation hearings, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee set a committee vote on Judge Barrett’s nomination for Oct. 22 hoping to speed a final vote to as soon as Oct. 26 — one week and a day before Election Day.
As she did on judicial matters, such as her views on Roe v. Wade, Judge Barrett declined to state her thoughts on climate change in exchange after exchange this week, equating her evasions to the well-established precedent of refusing to comment on issues that could come before the court.
But with Senator Kamala Harris of California, the Democratic candidate for vice president, Judge Barrett, the daughter of an oil executive, went further. She described the settled science of climate change as still in dispute, compared to Ms. Harris’s other examples, including whether smoking causes cancer and the coronavirus is infectious.
“Do you believe that climate change is happening and threatening the air we breathe and the water that we drink?” Ms. Harris asked.
Judge Barrett responded, “You asked me uncontroversial questions, like Covid-19 being infectious or if smoking causes cancer” to solicit “an opinion from me on a very contentious matter of public debate,” climate change.
“I will not do that,” Judge Barrett concluded. “I will not express a view on a matter of public policy, especially one that is politically controversial.”
Republicans showed no sign of discomfort with that answer. But her performance raised alarm bells around the world. Greta Thunberg, the young Swedish climate activist, took to Twitter to quip, “To be fair, I don’t have any ‘views on climate change’ either. Just like I don’t have any ‘views’ on gravity, the fact that the earth is round, photosynthesis nor evolution.”
“But,” she continued, “understanding and knowing their existence really makes life in the 21st century so much easier.”
Michael Gerrard, the founder of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University Law School, said her “non-answer on global warming” does not necessarily put her in the climate denial camp; it could have been “reflexive stonewalling.” But, he said, “it’s driven people up the wall.”
It was not just the exchange with Ms. Harris. On Tuesday, in a friendlier give-and-take with Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, Judge Barrett fell back on the excuse that “I’m certainly not a scientist,” when asked her views on a warming planet. That might sound bland, but it closely tracks the language used by Republican lawmakers who oppose action on climate change or deny the science outright.
And stating “I would not say I have firm views on it” in the face of so much evidence of climate change in daily life, as Judge Barrett did, is controversial.
“She’s a smart and sophisticated person,” said Richard L. Revesz, director of the institute for policy integrity at New York University Law School. “If she didn’t want to associate herself with the climate denial perspective, she could have used different words.”
White House spokesman Judd Deere, in response to questions about Judge Barrett’s two days of hearings, said, “During her 20-plus hours of testimony, Judge Barrett made clear what she committed to the American people the day she was nominated: ‘Judges are not policymakers.’”
Judge Barrett’s insistence that she has no opinion on climate change places her within a small and shrinking minority of Americans. Today, 73 percent of Americans say that global warming is happening, and 62 percent of Americans accept that it is human caused. A decade ago, 57 percent accepted that climate. change was happening. Only 20 percent of Americans say they fit the “I don’t know” category.
And it was not at all clear why she insisted on not answering whether climate change was real, said Ann Carlson, who is a director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the U.C.L.A. School of Law. Professor Carlson said Judge Barrett implied that stating a scientific fact could somehow be prejudicial to future high court deliberations, yet she was willing to state other obvious facts that have borne on litigation, such as cigarette smoking causes cancer.
Alex Flint, a former senior Republican Senate aide who was involved with more than 70 federal government confirmations, said he understood Judge Barrett’s actions. “None of the Democrats are going to support her, regardless of how she answers the question,” he said, so her answer was crafted to ensure she did not alienate the Republican senators she needs.
However, Mr. Flint, who now leads a Republican group to address climate change, the Alliance for Market Solutions, added that her response on climate may look like smart politics today, but it is not necessarily good for the future of the party, which needs “to build credibility, especially with young and college educated voters whose role in elections is growing.”
A Justice Barrett could have real effects on efforts to address climate change.
The prior jurisprudence is clear. In the 2007 case Massachusetts v. the Environmental Protection Agency, the Supreme Court declared that greenhouse gases are covered under the Clean Air Act and that the agency can act to counter climate change. In 2009, the E.P.A. issued what is known as the “endangerment finding,” which said that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. That finding was challenged in the courts and survived: the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the finding in 2012, and the Supreme Court declined to review the lower court’s decision, allowing it to stand.
If President Trump were to win a second term, Professor Revesz said, the government could withdraw the endangerment finding, and the inevitable court challenge could bring the fundamental question of climate change back before the Supreme Court.
There is also the question of how Judge Barrett would approach regulatory matters. Professor Carlson suggested that Judge Barrett would seek to interpret the E.P.A.’s powers narrowly. Other conservative members of the Supreme Court have indicated a willingness to revive a legal doctrine that holds that Congress should not give regulatory agencies much leeway in executing policies. With six votes, the conservative bloc could tie the hands of regulators.
“The future of the administrative state, in many respects, is on the line — and her refusal to answer basic questions about things like climate science makes me worry that we could see a whole dismantling of agencies that we have come to rely on for environmental protection,” she said.
Limits on administrative power would leave Congress with the task of being much more specific in drafting environmental legislation, Professor Gerrard said. “A very specific, well crafted law by Congress would be very hard for the courts to get around,” he said. Yet narrowly crafted laws don’t always adapt well to changing circumstances, as the years pass.
Leaving statutes vague, however, has been a way for Congress to finesse fights. A demand for specificity would make passage of environmental legislation even harder than it is now.
Judge Barrett’s family has strong ties to the fossil fuel industry.
Her father, Michael E. Coney, worked as a prominent attorney at Shell Oil in New Orleans and Houston for 29 years, from 1978 to 2007, focusing on deep sea exploration and drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf. As part of his work, he represented the oil and gas giant before the federal government, frequently dealing with the Department of Interior on royalties, regulations and compliance issues.
Mr. Coney was also an active member of the powerful oil and gas trade organization, the American Petroleum Institute, twice serving as chairman of its Subcommittee on Exploration and Production Law. On top of being the industry’s main lobby group, A.P.I. has played a critical role in casting doubt on climate science and opposing policies to address climate change.
Judge Barrett has previously recused herself from cases involving four Shell entities related to her father’s work. She has not recused herself from matters involving the A.P.I.
Stephen Gillers, a professor at the New York University School of Law, said Judge Barrett was likely exercising an abundance of caution in recusing herself from cases involving her father’s former employer. She would need to recuse herself, he said, if her father was ever a party to, or an acting lawyer on, a case before her — unlikely scenarios now that her father has retired. She would also need to recuse herself if a case required the court to evaluate or critique her father’s case work, which could mean he would have an interest in being exonerated, or having his work found appropriate, Professor Gillers said.
“Her father’s close identification with Shell and A.P.I. alone is simply not enough to require recusal from the industry,” he said.
To Carlos Curbelo, a former Republican member of Congress who supports action on climate change, the focus on Judge Barrett’s comments misses a broader point that the courts are not the proper venue for dealing with a problem as vast and complex as climate.
“Because Congress has been so dysfunctional for so many years, now we look to the courts,” Mr. Curbelo said, “but we should be far more concerned with lawmakers and their understanding of the issue and willingness to act.”

Thirty years ago, we had a chance to save the planet.
The science of climate change was settled. The world was ready to act. 
  Almost nothing stood in our way -- except ourselves.
  --
  Editor's Note
  This narrative by Nathaniel Rich is a work of history, addressing the 10-year period from 1979 to 1989: the decisive decade when humankind first came to a broad understanding of the causes and dangers of climate change. Complementing the text is a series of aerial photographs and videos, all shot over the past year by George Steinmetz. With support from the Pulitzer Center, this two-part article is based on 18 months of reporting and well over a hundred interviews. It tracks the efforts of a small group of American scientists, activists and politicians to raise the alarm and stave off catastrophe. It will come as a revelation to many readers -- an agonizing revelation -- to understand how thoroughly they grasped the problem and how close they came to solving it. Jake Silverstein
  Prologue
  The world has warmed more than one degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution. The Paris climate agreement -- the nonbinding, unenforceable and already unheeded treaty signed on Earth Day in 2016 -- hoped to restrict warming to two degrees. The odds of succeeding, according to a recent study based on current emissions trends, are one in 20. If by some miracle we are able to limit warming to two degrees, we will only have to negotiate the extinction of the world's tropical reefs, sea-level rise of several meters and the abandonment of the Persian Gulf. The climate scientist James Hansen has called two-degree warming ''a prescription for long-term disaster.'' Long-term disaster is now the best-case scenario. Three-degree warming is a prescription for short-term disaster: forests in the Arctic and the loss of most coastal cities. Robert Watson, a former director of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has argued that three-degree warming is the realistic minimum. Four degrees: Europe in permanent drought; vast areas of China, India and Bangladesh claimed by desert; Polynesia swallowed by the sea; the Colorado River thinned to a trickle; the American Southwest largely uninhabitable. The prospect of a five-degree warming has prompted some of the world's leading climate scientists to warn of the end of human civilization.
  Is it a comfort or a curse, the knowledge that we could have avoided all this?
  Because in the decade that ran from 1979 to 1989, we had an excellent opportunity to solve the climate crisis. The world's major powers came within several signatures of endorsing a binding, global framework to reduce carbon emissions -- far closer than we've come since. During those years, the conditions for success could not have been more favorable. The obstacles we blame for our current inaction had yet to emerge. Almost nothing stood in our way -- nothing except ourselves.
  Nearly everything we understand about global warming was understood in 1979. By that year, data collected since 1957 confirmed what had been known since before the turn of the 20th century: Human beings have altered Earth's atmosphere through the indiscriminate burning of fossil fuels. The main scientific questions were settled beyond debate, and as the 1980s began, attention turned from diagnosis of the problem to refinement of the predicted consequences. Compared with string theory and genetic engineering, the ''greenhouse effect'' -- a metaphor dating to the early 1900s -- was ancient history, described in any Introduction to Biology textbook. Nor was the basic science especially complicated. It could be reduced to a simple axiom: The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet. And every year, by burning coal, oil and gas, humankind belched increasingly obscene quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
  Why didn't we act? A common boogeyman today is the fossil-fuel industry, which in recent decades has committed to playing the role of villain with comic-book bravado. An entire subfield of climate literature has chronicled the machinations of industry lobbyists, the corruption of scientists and the propaganda campaigns that even now continue to debase the political debate, long after the largest oil-and-gas companies have abandoned the dumb show of denialism. But the coordinated efforts to bewilder the public did not begin in earnest until the end of 1989. During the preceding decade, some of the largest oil companies, including Exxon and Shell, made good-faith efforts to understand the scope of the crisis and grapple with possible solutions.
  Nor can the Republican Party be blamed. Today, only 42 percent of Republicans know that ''most scientists believe global warming is occurring,'' and that percentage is falling. But during the 1980s, many prominent Republicans joined Democrats in judging the climate problem to be a rare political winner: nonpartisan and of the highest possible stakes. Among those who called for urgent, immediate and far-reaching climate policy were Senators John Chafee, Robert Stafford and David Durenberger; the E.P.A. administrator, William K. Reilly; and, during his campaign for president, George H.W. Bush. As Malcolm Forbes Baldwin, the acting chairman of the president's Council for Environmental Quality, told industry executives in 1981, ''There can be no more important or conservative concern than the protection of the globe itself.'' The issue was unimpeachable, like support for veterans or small business. Except the climate had an even broader constituency, composed of every human being on Earth.
  It was understood that action would have to come immediately. At the start of the 1980s, scientists within the federal government predicted that conclusive evidence of warming would appear on the global temperature record by the end of the decade, at which point it would be too late to avoid disaster. More than 30 percent of the human population lacked access to electricity. Billions of people would not need to attain the ''American way of life'' in order to drastically increase global carbon emissions; a light bulb in every village would do it. A report prepared at the request of the White House by the National Academy of Sciences advised that ''the carbon-dioxide issue should appear on the international agenda in a context that will maximize cooperation and consensus-building and minimize political manipulation, controversy and division.'' If the world had adopted the proposal widely endorsed at the end of the '80s -- a freezing of carbon emissions, with a reduction of 20 percent by 2005 -- warming could have been held to less than 1.5 degrees.
  A broad international consensus had settled on a solution: a global treaty to curb carbon emissions. The idea began to coalesce as early as February 1979, at the first World Climate Conference in Geneva, when scientists from 50 nations agreed unanimously that it was ''urgently necessary'' to act. Four months later, at the Group of 7 meeting in Tokyo, the leaders of the world's seven wealthiest nations signed a statement resolving to reduce carbon emissions. Ten years later, the first major diplomatic meeting to approve the framework for a binding treaty was called in the Netherlands. Delegates from more than 60 nations attended, with the goal of establishing a global summit meeting to be held about a year later. Among scientists and world leaders, the sentiment was unanimous: Action had to be taken, and the United States would need to lead. It didn't.
  The inaugural chapter of the climate-change saga is over. In that chapter -- call it Apprehension -- we identified the threat and its consequences. We spoke, with increasing urgency and self-delusion, of the prospect of triumphing against long odds. But we did not seriously consider the prospect of failure. We understood what failure would mean for global temperatures, coastlines, agricultural yield, immigration patterns, the world economy. But we have not allowed ourselves to comprehend what failure might mean for us. How will it change the way we see ourselves, how we remember the past, how we imagine the future? Why did we do this to ourselves? These questions will be the subject of climate change's second chapter -- call it The Reckoning. There can be no understanding of our current and future predicament without understanding why we failed to solve this problem when we had the chance.
  That we came so close, as a civilization, to breaking our suicide pact with fossil fuels can be credited to the efforts of a handful of people, among them a hyperkinetic lobbyist and a guileless atmospheric physicist who, at great personal cost, tried to warn humanity of what was coming. They risked their careers in a painful, escalating campaign to solve the problem, first in scientific reports, later through conventional avenues of political persuasion and finally with a strategy of public shaming. Their efforts were shrewd, passionate, robust. And they failed. What follows is their story, and ours.
  Part One 1979--1982
  1. 'This Is the Whole Banana' Spring 1979
  The first suggestion to Rafe Pomerance that humankind was destroying the conditions necessary for its own survival came on Page 66 of the government publication EPA-600/7-78-019. It was a technical report about coal, bound in a coal-black cover with beige lettering -- one of many such reports that lay in uneven piles around Pomerance's windowless office on the first floor of the Capitol Hill townhouse that, in the late 1970s, served as the Washington headquarters of Friends of the Earth. In the final paragraph of a chapter on environmental regulation, the coal report's authors noted that the continued use of fossil fuels might, within two or three decades, bring about ''significant and damaging'' changes to the global atmosphere.
  Pomerance paused, startled, over the orphaned paragraph. It seemed to have come out of nowhere. He reread it. It made no sense to him. Pomerance was not a scientist; he graduated from Cornell 11 years earlier with a degree in history. He had the tweedy appearance of an undernourished doctoral student emerging at dawn from the stacks. He wore horn-rimmed glasses and a thickish mustache that wilted disapprovingly over the corners of his mouth, though his defining characteristic was his gratuitous height, 6 feet 4 inches, which seemed to embarrass him; he stooped over to accommodate his interlocutors. He had an active face prone to breaking out in wide, even maniacal grins, but in composure, as when he read the coal pamphlet, it projected concern. He struggled with technical reports. He proceeded as a historian might: cautiously, scrutinizing the source material, reading between the lines. When that failed, he made phone calls, often to the authors of the reports, who tended to be surprised to hear from him. Scientists, he had found, were not in the habit of fielding questions from political lobbyists. They were not in the habit of thinking about politics.
  Pomerance had one big question about the coal report. If the burning of coal, oil and natural gas could invite global catastrophe, why had nobody told him about it? If anyone in Washington -- if anyone in the United States -- should have been aware of such a danger, it was Pomerance. As the deputy legislative director of Friends of the Earth, the wily, pugnacious nonprofit that David Brower helped found after resigning from the Sierra Club a decade earlier, Pomerance was one of the nation's most connected environmental activists. That he was as easily accepted in the halls of the Dirksen Senate Office Building as at Earth Day rallies might have had something to do with the fact that he was a Morgenthau -- the great-grandson of Henry Sr., Woodrow Wilson's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire; great-nephew of Henry Jr., Franklin D. Roosevelt's Treasury secretary; second cousin to Robert, district attorney for Manhattan. Or perhaps it was just his charisma -- voluble, energetic and obsessive, he seemed to be everywhere, speaking with everyone, in a very loud voice, at once. His chief obsession was air. After working as an organizer for welfare rights, he spent the second half of his 20s laboring to protect and expand the Clean Air Act, the comprehensive law regulating air pollution. That led him to the problem of acid rain, and the coal report.
  He showed the unsettling paragraph to his office mate, Betsy Agle. Had she ever heard of the ''greenhouse effect''? Was it really possible that human beings were overheating the planet?
  Agle shrugged. She hadn't heard about it, either.
  That might have been the end of it, had Agle not greeted Pomerance in the office a few mornings later holding a copy of a newspaper forwarded by Friends of the Earth's Denver office. Isn't this what you were talking about the other day? she asked.
  Agle pointed to an article about a prominent geophysicist named Gordon MacDonald, who was conducting a study on climate change with the Jasons, the mysterious coterie of elite scientists to which he belonged. Pomerance hadn't heard of MacDonald, but he knew all about the Jasons. They were like one of those teams of superheroes with complementary powers that join forces in times of galactic crisis. They had been brought together by federal agencies, including the C.I.A, to devise scientific solutions to national-security problems: how to detect an incoming missile; how to predict fallout from a nuclear bomb; how to develop unconventional weapons, like plague-infested rats. The Jasons' activities had been a secret until the publication of the Pentagon Papers, which exposed their plan to festoon the Ho Chi Minh Trail with motion sensors that signaled to bombers. After the furor that followed -- protesters set MacDonald's garage on fire -- the Jasons began to use their powers for peace instead of war.
  There was an urgent problem that demanded their attention, MacDonald believed, because human civilization faced an existential crisis. In ''How to Wreck the Environment,'' a 1968 essay published while he was a science adviser to Lyndon Johnson, MacDonald predicted a near future in which ''nuclear weapons were effectively banned and the weapons of mass destruction were those of environmental catastrophe.'' One of the most potentially devastating such weapons, he believed, was the gas that we exhaled with every breath: carbon dioxide. By vastly increasing carbon emissions, the world's most advanced militaries could alter weather patterns and wreak famine, drought and economic collapse.
  In the decade since then, MacDonald had been alarmed to see humankind begin in earnest to weaponize weather -- not out of malice, but unwittingly. During the spring of 1977 and the summer of 1978, the Jasons met to determine what would happen once the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubled from pre-Industrial Revolution levels. It was an arbitrary milestone, the doubling, but a useful one, as its inevitability was not in question; the threshold would most likely be breached by 2035. The Jasons' report to the Department of Energy, ''The Long-Term Impact of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide on Climate,'' was written in an understated tone that only enhanced its nightmarish findings: Global temperatures would increase by an average of two to three degrees Celsius; Dust Bowl conditions would ''threaten large areas of North America, Asia and Africa''; access to drinking water and agricultural production would fall, triggering mass migration on an unprecedented scale. ''Perhaps the most ominous feature,'' however, was the effect of a changing climate on the poles. Even a minimal warming ''could lead to rapid melting'' of the West Antarctic ice sheet. The ice sheet contained enough water to raise the level of the oceans 16 feet.
  The Jasons sent the report to dozens of scientists in the United States and abroad; to industry groups like the National Coal Association and the Electric Power Research Institute; and within the government, to the National Academy of Sciences, the Commerce Department, the E.P.A., NASA, the Pentagon, the N.S.A., every branch of the military, the National Security Council and the White House.
  Pomerance read about the atmospheric crisis in a state of shock that swelled briskly into outrage. ''This,'' he told Betsy Agle, ''is the whole banana.''
  Gordon MacDonald worked at the federally funded Mitre Corporation, a think tank that works with agencies throughout the government. His title was senior research analyst, which was another way of saying senior science adviser to the national-intelligence community. After a single phone call, Pomerance, a former Vietnam War protester and conscientious objector, drove several miles on the Beltway to a group of anonymous white office buildings that more closely resembled the headquarters of a regional banking firm than the solar plexus of the American military-industrial complex. He was shown into the office of a brawny, soft-spoken man in blocky, horn-rimmed frames, who extended a hand like a bear's paw.
  ''I'm glad you're interested in this,'' MacDonald said, sizing up the young activist.
  ''How could I not be?'' Pomerance said. ''How could anyone not be?''
  MacDonald explained that he first studied the carbon-dioxide issue when he was about Pomerance's age -- in 1961, when he served as an adviser to John F. Kennedy. Pomerance pieced together that MacDonald, in his youth, had been something of a prodigy: In his 20s, he advised Dwight D. Eisenhower on space exploration; at 32, he became a member of the National Academy of Sciences; at 40, he was appointed to the inaugural Council on Environmental Quality, where he advised Richard Nixon on the environmental dangers of burning coal. He monitored the carbon-dioxide problem the whole time, with increasing alarm.
  MacDonald spoke for two hours. Pomerance was appalled. ''If I set up briefings with some people on the Hill,'' he asked MacDonald, ''will you tell them what you just told me?''
  Thus began the Gordon and Rafe carbon-dioxide roadshow. Beginning in the spring of 1979, Pomerance arranged informal briefings with the E.P.A., the National Security Council, The New York Times, the Council on Environmental Quality and the Energy Department, which, Pomerance learned, had established an Office of Carbon Dioxide Effects two years earlier at MacDonald's urging. The men settled into a routine, with MacDonald explaining the science and Pomerance adding the exclamation points. They were surprised to learn how few senior officials were familiar with the Jasons' findings, let alone understood the ramifications of global warming. At last, having worked their way up the federal hierarchy, the two went to see the president's top scientist, Frank Press.
  Press's office was in the Old Executive Office Building, the granite fortress that stands on the White House grounds just paces away from the West Wing. Out of respect for MacDonald, Press had summoned to their meeting what seemed to be the entire senior staff of the president's Office of Science and Technology Policy -- the officials consulted on every critical matter of energy and national security. What Pomerance had expected to be yet another casual briefing assumed the character of a high-level national-security meeting. He decided to let MacDonald do all the talking. There was no need to emphasize to Press and his lieutenants that this was an issue of profound national significance. The hushed mood in the office told him that this was already understood.
  To explain what the carbon-dioxide problem meant for the future, MacDonald would begin his presentation by going back more than a century to John Tyndall -- an Irish physicist who was an early champion of Charles Darwin's work and died after being accidentally poisoned by his wife. In 1859, Tyndall found that carbon dioxide absorbed heat and that variations in the composition of the atmosphere could create changes in climate. These findings inspired Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish chemist and future Nobel laureate, to deduce in 1896 that the combustion of coal and petroleum could raise global temperatures. This warming would become noticeable in a few centuries, Arrhenius calculated, or sooner if consumption of fossil fuels continued to increase.
  Consumption increased beyond anything the Swedish chemist could have imagined. Four decades later, a British steam engineer named Guy Stewart Callendar discovered that, at the weather stations he observed, the previous five years were the hottest in recorded history. Humankind, he wrote in a paper, had become ''able to speed up the processes of Nature.'' That was in 1939.
  MacDonald's voice was calm but authoritative, his powerful, heavy hands conveying the force of his argument. He was a geophysicist trapped in the body of an offensive lineman -- he had turned down a football scholarship to Rice in order to attend Harvard -- and seemed miscast as a preacher of atmospheric physics and existential doom. His audience listened in bowed silence. Pomerance couldn't read them. Political bureaucrats were skilled at hiding their opinions. Pomerance wasn't. He shifted restlessly in his chair, glancing between MacDonald and the government suits, trying to see whether they grasped the shape of the behemoth that MacDonald was describing.
  MacDonald's history concluded with Roger Revelle, perhaps the most distinguished of the priestly caste of government scientists who, since the Manhattan Project, advised every president on major policy; he had been a close colleague of MacDonald and Press since they served together under Kennedy. In a 1957 paper written with Hans Suess, Revelle concluded that ''human beings are now carrying out a large-scale geophysical experiment of a kind that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the future.'' Revelle helped the Weather Bureau establish a continuous measurement of atmospheric carbon dioxide at a site perched near the summit of Mauna Loa on the Big Island of Hawaii, 11,500 feet above the sea -- a rare pristine natural laboratory on a planet blanketed by fossil-fuel emissions. A young geochemist named Charles David Keeling charted the data. Keeling's graph came to be known as the Keeling curve, though it more closely resembled a jagged lightning bolt hurled toward the firmament. MacDonald had a habit of tracing the Keeling curve in the air, his thick forefinger jabbing toward the ceiling.
  After nearly a decade of observation, Revelle had shared his concerns with Lyndon Johnson, who included them in a special message to Congress two weeks after his inauguration. Johnson explained that his generation had ''altered the composition of the atmosphere on a global scale'' through the burning of fossil fuels, and his administration commissioned a study of the subject by his Science Advisory Committee. Revelle was its chairman, and its 1965 executive report on carbon dioxide warned of the rapid melting of Antarctica, rising seas, increased acidity of fresh waters -- changes that would require no less than a coordinated global effort to forestall.
  In 1974, the C.I.A. issued a classified report on the carbon-dioxide problem. It concluded that climate change had begun around 1960 and had ''already caused major economic problems throughout the world.'' The future economic and political impacts would be ''almost beyond comprehension.'' Yet emissions continued to rise, and at this rate, MacDonald warned, they could see a snowless New England, the swamping of major coastal cities, as much as a 40 percent decline in national wheat production, the forced migration of about one-quarter of the world's population. Not within centuries -- within their own lifetimes.
  ''What would you have us do?'' Press asked.
  The president's plan, in the wake of the Saudi oil crisis, to promote solar energy -- he had gone so far as to install 32 solar panels on the roof of the White House to heat his family's water -- was a good start, MacDonald thought. But Jimmy Carter's plan to stimulate production of synthetic fuels -- gas and liquid fuel extracted from shale and tar sands -- was a dangerous idea. Nuclear power, despite the recent tragedy at Three Mile Island, should be expanded. But even natural gas and ethanol were preferable to coal. There was no way around it: Coal production would ultimately have to end.
  The president's advisers asked respectful questions, but Pomerance couldn't tell whether they were persuaded. The men all stood and shook hands, and Press led MacDonald and Pomerance out of his office. After they emerged from the Old Executive Office Building onto Pennsylvania Avenue, Pomerance asked MacDonald what he thought would happen.
  Knowing Frank as I do, MacDonald said, I really couldn't tell you.
  In the days that followed, Pomerance grew uneasy. Until this point, he had fixated on the science of the carbon-dioxide issue and its possible political ramifications. But now that his meetings on Capitol Hill had concluded, he began to question what all this might mean for his own future. His wife, Lenore, was eight months pregnant; was it ethical, he wondered, to bring a child onto a planet that before much longer could become inhospitable to life? And he wondered why it had fallen to him, a 32-year-old lobbyist without scientific training, to bring greater attention to this crisis.
  Finally, weeks later, MacDonald called to tell him that Press had taken up the issue. On May 22, Press wrote a letter to the president of the National Academy of Sciences requesting a full assessment of the carbon-dioxide issue. Jule Charney, the father of modern meteorology, would gather the nation's top oceanographers, atmospheric scientists and climate modelers to judge whether MacDonald's alarm was justified -- whether the world was, in fact, headed to cataclysm.
  Pomerance was amazed by how much momentum had built in such a short time. Scientists at the highest levels of government had known about the dangers of fossil-fuel combustion for decades. Yet they had produced little besides journal articles, academic symposiums, technical reports. Nor had any politician, journalist or activist championed the issue. That, Pomerance figured, was about to change. If Charney's group confirmed that the world was careering toward an existential crisis, the president would be forced to act.
  2. The Whimsies of The Invisible World Spring 1979
  There was a brown velvet love seat in the living room of James and Anniek Hansen, under a bright window looking out on Morningside Park in Manhattan, that nobody ever sat in. Erik, their 2-year-old son, was forbidden to go near it. The ceiling above the couch sagged ominously, as if pregnant with some alien life form, and the bulge grew with each passing week. Jim promised Anniek that he would fix it, which was only fair, because it had been on his insistence that they gave up the prospect of a prewar apartment in Spuyten Duyvil overlooking the Hudson and moved from Riverdale to this two-story walk-up with crumbling walls, police-siren lullabies and gravid ceiling. Jim had resented the 45-minute commute to NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan and complained that such a gross waste of his time would soon be unsustainable, once the Pioneer spacecraft reached Venus and began to beam back data. But even after the Hansens moved within a few blocks of the institute, Jim couldn't make time for the ceiling, and after four months it finally burst, releasing a confetti of browned pipes and splintered wood.
  Jim repeated his vow to fix the ceiling as soon as he had a moment free from work. Anniek held him to his word, though it required her to live with a hole in her ceiling until Thanksgiving -- seven months of plaster dust powdering the love seat.
  Another promise Jim made to Anniek: He would make it home for dinner every night by 7 p.m. By 8:30, however, he was back at his calculations. Anniek did not begrudge him his deep commitment to his work; it was one of the things she loved about him. Still, it baffled her that the subject of his obsession should be the atmospheric conditions of a planet more than 24 million miles away. It baffled Jim, too. His voyage to Venus from Denison, Iowa, the fifth child of a diner waitress and an itinerant farmer turned bartender, had been a series of bizarre twists of fate over which he claimed no agency. It was just something that happened to him.
  Hansen figured he was the only scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who, as a child, did not dream of outer space. He dreamed only of baseball. On clear nights, his transistor radio picked up the broadcast of the Kansas City Blues, the New York Yankees' AAA affiliate. Every morning, he cut out the box scores, pasted them into a notebook and tallied statistics. Hansen found comfort in numbers and equations. He majored in math and physics at the University of Iowa, but he never would have taken an interest in celestial matters were it not for the unlikely coincidence of two events during the year he graduated: the eruption of a volcano in Bali and a total eclipse of the moon.
  On the night of Dec. 30, 1963 -- whipping wind, 12 degrees below zero -- Hansen accompanied his astronomy professor to a cornfield far from town. They set a telescope in an old corncrib and, between 2 and 8 in the morning, made continuous photoelectric recordings of the eclipse, pausing only when the extension cord froze and when they dashed to the car for a few minutes to avoid frostbite.
  During an eclipse, the moon resembles a tangerine or, if the eclipse is total, a drop of blood. But this night, the moon vanished altogether. Hansen made the mystery the subject of his master's thesis, concluding that the moon had been obscured by the dust erupted into the atmosphere by Mount Agung, on the other side of the planet from his corncrib, six months earlier. The discovery led to his fascination with the influence of invisible particles on the visible world. You could not make sense of the visible world until you understood the whimsies of the invisible one.
  One of the leading authorities on the invisible world happened to be teaching then at Iowa: James Van Allen made the first major discovery of the space age, identifying the two doughnut-shaped regions of convulsing particles that circle Earth, now known as the Van Allen belts. At Van Allen's prodding, Hansen turned from the moon to Venus. Why, he tried to determine, was its surface so hot? In 1967, a Soviet satellite beamed back the answer: The planet's atmosphere was mainly carbon dioxide. Though once it may have had habitable temperatures, it was believed to have succumbed to a runaway greenhouse effect: As the sun grew brighter, Venus's ocean began to evaporate, thickening the atmosphere, which forced yet greater evaporation -- a self-perpetuating cycle that finally boiled off the ocean entirely and heated the planet's surface to more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit. At the other extreme, Mars's thin atmosphere had insufficient carbon dioxide to trap much heat at all, leaving it about 900 degrees colder. Earth lay in the middle, its Goldilocks greenhouse effect just strong enough to support life.
  Anniek expected Jim's professional life to resume some semblance of normality once the data from Venus had been collected and analyzed. But shortly after Pioneer entered Venus's atmosphere, Hansen came home from the office in an uncharacteristic fervor -- with an apology. The prospect of two or three more years of intense work had sprung up before him. NASA was expanding its study of Earth's atmospheric conditions. Hansen had already done some work on Earth's atmosphere for Jule Charney at the Goddard Institute, helping to develop computerized weather models. Now Hansen would have an opportunity to apply to Earth the lessons he had learned from Venus.
  We want to learn more about Earth's climate, Jim told Anniek -- and how humanity can influence it. He would use giant new supercomputers to map the planet's atmosphere. They would create Mirror Worlds: parallel realities that mimicked our own. These digital simulacra, technically called ''general circulation models,'' combined the mathematical formulas that governed the behavior of the sea, land and sky into a single computer model. Unlike the real world, they could be sped forward to reveal the future.
  Anniek's disappointment -- another several years of distraction, stress, time spent apart from family -- was tempered, if only slightly, by the high strain of Jim's enthusiasm. She thought she understood it. Does this mean, she asked, that you'll able to predict weather more accurately?
  Yes, Jim said. Something like that.
  3. Between Catastrophe and Chaos July 1979
  The scientists summoned by Jule Charney to judge the fate of civilization arrived on July 23, 1979, with their wives, children and weekend bags at a three-story mansion in Woods Hole, on the southwestern spur of Cape Cod. They would review all the available science and decide whether the White House should take seriously Gordon MacDonald's prediction of a climate apocalypse. The Jasons had predicted a warming of two or three degrees Celsius by the middle of the 21st century, but like Roger Revelle before them, they emphasized their reasons for uncertainty. Charney's scientists were asked to quantify that uncertainty. They had to get it right: Their conclusion would be delivered to the president. But first they would hold a clambake.
  They gathered with their families on a bluff overlooking Quissett Harbor and took turns tossing mesh produce bags stuffed with lobster, clams and corn into a bubbling caldron. While the children scrambled across the rolling lawn, the scientists mingled with a claque of visiting dignitaries, whose status lay somewhere between chaperone and client -- men from the Departments of State, Energy, Defense and Agriculture; the E.P.A.; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They exchanged pleasantries and took in the sunset. It was a hot day, high 80s, but the harbor breeze was salty and cool. It didn't look like the dawning of an apocalypse. The government officials, many of them scientists themselves, tried to suppress their awe of the legends in their presence: Henry Stommel, the world's leading oceanographer; his protÃ©gÃ©, Carl Wunsch, a Jason; the Manhattan Project alumnus Cecil Leith; the Harvard planetary physicist Richard Goody. These were the men who, in the last three decades, had discovered foundational principles underlying the relationships among sun, atmosphere, land and ocean -- which is to say, the climate.
  The hierarchy was made visible during the workshop sessions, held in the carriage house next door: The scientists sat at tables arranged in a rectangle, while their federal observers sat along the room's perimeter, taking in the action as at a theater in the round. The first two days of meetings didn't make very good theater, however, as the scientists reviewed the basic principles of the carbon cycle, ocean circulation, radiative transfer. On the third day, Charney introduced a new prop: a black speaker, attached to a telephone. He dialed, and Jim Hansen answered.
  Charney called Hansen because he had grasped that in order to determine the exact range of future warming, his group would have to venture into the realm of the Mirror Worlds. Jule Charney himself had used a general circulation model to revolutionize weather prediction. But Hansen was one of just a few modelers who had studied the effects of carbon emissions. When, at Charney's request, Hansen programmed his model to consider a future of doubled carbon dioxide, it predicted a temperature increase of four degrees Celsius. That was twice as much warming as the prediction made by the most prominent climate modeler, Syukuro Manabe, whose government lab at Princeton was the first to model the greenhouse effect. The difference between the two predictions -- between warming of two degrees Celsius and four degrees Celsius -- was the difference between damaged coral reefs and no reefs whatsoever, between thinning forests and forests enveloped by desert, between catastrophe and chaos.
  In the carriage house, the disembodied voice of Jim Hansen explained, in a quiet, matter-of-fact tone, how his model weighed the influences of clouds, oceans and snow on warming. The older scientists interrupted, shouting questions; when they did not transmit through the telephone, Charney repeated them in a bellow. The questions kept coming, often before their younger respondent could finish his answers, and Hansen wondered if it wouldn't have been easier for him to drive the five hours and meet with them in person.
  Among Charney's group was Akio Arakawa, a pioneer of computer modeling. On the final night at Woods Hole, Arakawa stayed up in his motel room with printouts from the models by Hansen and Manabe blanketing his double bed. The discrepancy between the models, Arakawa concluded, came down to ice and snow. The whiteness of the world's snowfields reflected light; if snow melted in a warmer climate, less radiation would escape the atmosphere, leading to even greater warming. Shortly before dawn, Arakawa concluded that Manabe had given too little weight to the influence of melting sea ice, while Hansen had overemphasized it. The best estimate lay in between. Which meant that the Jasons' calculation was too optimistic. When carbon dioxide doubled in 2035 or thereabouts, global temperatures would increase between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius, with the most likely outcome a warming of three degrees.
  The publication of Jule Charney's report, ''Carbon Dioxide and Climate: A Scientific Assessment,'' several months later was not accompanied by a banquet, a parade or even a news conference. Yet within the highest levels of the federal government, the scientific community and the oil-and-gas industry -- within the commonwealth of people who had begun to concern themselves with the future habitability of the planet -- the Charney report would come to have the authority of settled fact. It was the summation of all the predictions that had come before, and it would withstand the scrutiny of the decades that followed it. Charney's group had considered everything known about ocean, sun, sea, air and fossil fuels and had distilled it to a single number: three. When the doubling threshold was broached, as appeared inevitable, the world would warm three degrees Celsius. The last time the world was three degrees warmer was during the Pliocene, three million years ago, when beech trees grew in Antarctica, the seas were 80 feet higher and horses galloped across the Canadian coast of the Arctic Ocean.
  The Charney report left Jim Hansen with more urgent questions. Three degrees would be nightmarish, and unless carbon emissions ceased suddenly, three degrees would be only the beginning. The real question was whether the warming trend could be reversed. Was there time to act? And how would a global commitment to cease burning fossil fuels come about, exactly? Who had the power to make such a thing happen? Hansen didn't know how to begin to answer these questions. But he would learn.
  4. 'A Very Aggressive Defensive Program' Summer 1979-Summer 1980
  After the publication of the Charney report, Exxon decided to create its own dedicated carbon-dioxide research program, with an annual budget of $600,000. Only Exxon was asking a slightly different question than Jule Charney. Exxon didn't concern itself primarily with how much the world would warm. It wanted to know how much of the warming Exxon could be blamed for.
  A senior researcher named Henry Shaw had argued that the company needed a deeper understanding of the issue in order to influence future legislation that might restrict carbon-dioxide emissions. ''It behooves us to start a very aggressive defensive program,'' Shaw wrote in a memo to a manager, ''because there is a good probability that legislation affecting our business will be passed.''
  Shaw turned to Wallace Broecker, a Columbia University oceanographer who was the second author of Roger Revelle's 1965 carbon-dioxide report for Lyndon Johnson. In 1977, in a presentation at the American Geophysical Union, Broecker predicted that fossil fuels would have to be restricted, whether by taxation or fiat. More recently, he had testified before Congress, calling carbon dioxide ''the No.1 long-term environmental problem.'' If presidents and senators trusted Broecker to tell them the bad news, he was good enough for Exxon.
  The company had been studying the carbon-dioxide problem for decades, since before it changed its name to Exxon. In 1957, scientists from Humble Oil published a study tracking ''the enormous quantity of carbon dioxide'' contributed to the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution ''from the combustion of fossil fuels.'' Even then, the observation that burning fossil fuels had increased the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere was well understood and accepted by Humble's scientists. What was new, in 1957, was the effort to quantify what percentage of emissions had been contributed by the oil-and-gas industry.
  The American Petroleum Institute, the industry's largest trade association, asked the same question in 1958 through its air-pollution study group and replicated the findings made by Humble Oil. So did another A.P.I. study conducted by the Stanford Research Institute a decade later, in 1968, which concluded that the burning of fossil fuels would bring ''significant temperature changes'' by the year 2000 and ultimately ''serious worldwide environmental changes,'' including the melting of the Antarctic ice cap and rising seas. It was ''ironic,'' the study's authors noted, that politicians, regulators and environmentalists fixated on local incidents of air pollution that were immediately observable, while the climate crisis, whose damage would be of far greater severity and scale, went entirely unheeded.
  The ritual repeated itself every few years. Industry scientists, at the behest of their corporate bosses, reviewed the problem and found good reasons for alarm and better excuses to do nothing. Why should they act when almost nobody within the United States government -- nor, for that matter, within the environmental movement -- seemed worried? Besides, as the National Petroleum Council put it in 1972, changes in the climate would probably not be apparent ''until at least the turn of the century.'' The industry had enough urgent crises: antitrust legislation introduced by Senator Ted Kennedy; concerns about the health effects of gasoline; battles over the Clean Air Act; and the financial shock of benzene regulation, which increased the cost of every gallon of gas sold in America. Why take on an intractable problem that would not be detected until this generation of employees was safely retired? Worse, the solutions seemed more punitive than the problem itself. Historically, energy use had correlated to economic growth -- the more fossil fuels we burned, the better our lives became. Why mess with that?
  But the Charney report had changed industry's cost-benefit calculus. Now there was a formal consensus about the nature of the crisis. As Henry Shaw emphasized in his conversations with Exxon's executives, the cost of inattention would rise in step with the Keeling curve.
  Wallace Broecker did not think much of one of Exxon's proposals for its new carbon-dioxide program: testing the corked air in vintage bottles of French wine to demonstrate how much carbon levels had increased over time. But he did help his colleague Taro Takahashi with a more ambitious experiment conducted onboard one of Exxon's largest supertankers, the Esso Atlantic, to determine how much carbon the oceans could absorb before coughing it back into the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the graduate student installed on the tanker botched the job, and the data came back a mess.
  Shaw was running out of time. In 1978, an Exxon colleague circulated an internal memo warning that humankind had only five to 10 years before policy action would be necessary. But Congress seemed ready to act a lot sooner than that. On April 3, 1980, Senator Paul Tsongas, a Massachusetts Democrat, held the first congressional hearing on carbon-dioxide buildup in the atmosphere. Gordon MacDonald testified that the United States should ''take the initiative'' and develop, through the United Nations, a way to coordinate every nation's energy policies to address the problem. That June, Jimmy Carter signed the Energy Security Act of 1980, which directed the National Academy of Sciences to start a multiyear, comprehensive study, to be called ''Changing Climate,'' that would analyze social and economic effects of climate change. More urgent, the National Commission on Air Quality, at the request of Congress, invited two dozen experts, including Henry Shaw himself, to a meeting in Florida to propose climate policy.
  It seemed that some kind of legislation to restrict carbon combustion was inevitable. The Charney report had confirmed the diagnosis of the problem -- a problem that Exxon helped create. Now Exxon would help shape the solution.
  5. 'We Are Flying Blind' October 1980
  Two days before Halloween, Rafe Pomerance traveled to a cotton-candy castle on the Gulf of Mexico, near St. Petersburg, Fla, that locals called the Pink Palace. The Don CeSar hotel was a child's daydream with cantilevered planes of bubble-gum stucco and vanilla-white cupolas that appeared to melt in the sunshine like scoops of ice cream. The hotel stood amid blooms of poisonwood and gumbo limbo on a narrow spit of porous limestone that rose no higher than five feet above the sea. In its carnival of historical amnesia and childlike faith in the power of fantasy, the Pink Palace was a fine setting for the first rehearsal of a conversation that would be earnestly restaged, with little variation and increasing desperation, for the next 40 years.
  In the year and a half since he had read the coal report, Pomerance had attended countless conferences and briefings about the science of global warming. But until now, nobody had shown much interest in the only subject that he cared about, the only subject that mattered -- how to prevent warming. In a sense, he had himself to thank: During the expansion of the Clean Air Act, he pushed for the creation of the National Commission on Air Quality, charged with ensuring that the goals of the act were being met. One such goal was a stable global climate. The Charney report had made clear that goal was not being met, and now the commission wanted to hear proposals for legislation. It was a profound responsibility, and the two dozen experts invited to the Pink Palace -- policy gurus, deep thinkers, an industry scientist and an environmental activist -- had only three days to achieve it, but the utopian setting made everything seem possible. The conference room looked better suited to hosting a wedding party than a bureaucratic meeting, its tall windows framing postcard views of the beach. The sands were blindingly white, the surf was idle, the air unseasonably hot and the dress code relaxed: sunglasses and guayaberas, jackets frowned upon.
  ''I have a very vested interest in this,'' said State Representative Tom McPherson, a Florida Democrat, introducing himself to the delegation, ''because I own substantial holdings 15 miles inland of the coast, and any beachfront property appreciates in value.'' There was no formal agenda, just a young moderator from the E.P.A. named Thomas Jorling and a few handouts left on every seat, including a copy of the Charney report. Jorling acknowledged the vagueness of their mission.
  ''We are flying blind, with little or no idea where the mountains are,'' he said. But the stakes couldn't be higher: A failure to recommend policy, he said, would be the same as endorsing the present policy -- which was no policy. He asked who wanted ''to break the ice,'' not quite appreciating the pun.
  ''We might start out with an emotional question,'' proposed Thomas Waltz, an economist at the National Climate Program. ''The question is fundamental to being a human being: Do we care?''
  This provoked huffy consternation. ''In caring or not caring,'' said John Laurmann, a Stanford engineer, ''I would think the main thing is the timing.'' It was not an emotional question, in other words, but an economic one: How much did we value the future?
  We have less time than we realize, said an M.I.T. nuclear engineer named David Rose, who studied how civilizations responded to large technological crises. ''People leave their problems until the 11th hour, the 59th minute,'' he said. ''And then: 'Eloi, Eloi, Lama Sabachthani?' '' -- ''My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?'' It was a promising beginning, Pomerance thought. Urgent, detailed, cleareyed. The attendees seemed to share a sincere interest in finding solutions. They agreed that some kind of international treaty would ultimately be needed to keep atmospheric carbon dioxide at a safe level. But nobody could agree on what that level was.
  William Elliott, a NOAA scientist, introduced some hard facts: If the United States stopped burning carbon that year, it would delay the arrival of the doubling threshold by only five years. If Western nations somehow managed to stabilize emissions, it would forestall the inevitable by only eight years. The only way to avoid the worst was to stop burning coal. Yet China, the Soviet Union and the United States, by far the world's three largest coal producers, were frantically accelerating extraction.
  ''Do we have a problem?'' asked Anthony Scoville, a congressional science consultant. ''We do, but it is not the atmospheric problem. It is the political problem.'' He doubted that any scientific report, no matter how ominous its predictions, would persuade politicians to act.
  Pomerance glanced out at the beach, where the occasional tourist dawdled in the surf. Beyond the conference room, few Americans realized that the planet would soon cease to resemble itself.
  What if the problem was that they were thinking of it as a problem? ''What I am saying,'' Scoville continued, ''is that in a sense we are making a transition not only in energy but the economy as a whole.'' Even if the coal and oil industries collapsed, renewable technologies like solar energy would take their place. Jimmy Carter was planning to invest $80 billion in synthetic fuel. ''My God,'' Scoville said, ''with $80 billion, you could have a photovoltaics industry going that would obviate the need for synfuels forever!''
  The talk of ending oil production stirred for the first time the gentleman from Exxon. ''I think there is a transition period,'' Henry Shaw said. ''We are not going to stop burning fossil fuels and start looking toward solar or nuclear fusion and so on. We are going to have a very orderly transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.''
  ''We are talking about some major fights in this country,'' said Waltz, the economist. ''We had better be thinking this thing through.''
  But first -- lunch. It was a bright day, low 80s, and the group voted to break for three hours to enjoy the Florida sun. Pomerance couldn't -- he was restless. He had refrained from speaking, happy to let others lead the discussion, provided it moved in the right direction. But the high-minded talk had soon stalled into fecklessness and pusillanimity. He reflected that he was just about the only participant without an advanced degree. But few of these policy geniuses were showing much sense. They understood what was at stake, but they hadn't taken it to heart. They remained cool, detached -- pragmatists overmatched by a problem that had no pragmatic resolution. ''Prudence,'' Jorling said, ''is essential.''
  After lunch, Jorling tried to focus the conversation. What did they need to know in order to take action?
  David Slade, who as the director of the Energy Department's $200 million Office of Carbon Dioxide Effects had probably considered the question more deeply than anyone else in the room, said he figured that at some point, probably within their lifetimes, they would see the warming themselves.
  ''And at that time,'' Pomerance bellowed, ''it will be too late to do anything about it.''
  Yet nobody could agree what to do. John Perry, a meteorologist who had worked as a staff member on the Charney report, suggested that American energy policy merely ''take into account'' the risks of global warming, though he acknowledged that a nonbinding measure might seem ''intolerably stodgy.''
  ''It is so weak,'' Pomerance said, the air seeping out of him, ''as to not get us anywhere.''
  Reading the indecision in the room, Jorling reversed himself and wondered if it might be best to avoid proposing any specific policy. ''Let's not load ourselves down with that burden,'' he said. ''We'll let others worry.''
  Pomerance begged Jorling to reconsider. The commission had asked for hard proposals. But why stop there? Why not propose a new national energy plan? ''There is no single action that is going to solve the problem,'' Pomerance said. ''You can't keep saying, That isn't going to do it, and This isn't going to do it, because then we end up doing nothing.''
  Scoville pointed out that the United States was responsible for the largest share of global carbon emissions. But not for long. ''If we're going to exercise leadership,'' he said, ''the opportunity is now.'' One way to lead, he proposed, would be to classify carbon dioxide as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and regulate it as such. This was received by the room like a belch. By Scoville's logic, every sigh was an act of pollution. Did the science really support such an extreme measure?
  The Charney report did exactly that, Pomerance said. He was beginning to lose his patience, his civility, his stamina. ''Now, if everybody wants to sit around and wait until the world warms up more than it has warmed up since there have been humans around -- fine. But I would like to have a shot at avoiding it.''
  Most everybody else seemed content to sit around. Some of the attendees confused uncertainty around the margins of the issue (whether warming would be three or four degrees Celsius in 50 or 75 years) for uncertainty about the severity of the problem. As Gordon MacDonald liked to say, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would rise; the only question was when. The lag between the emission of a gas and the warming it produced could be several decades. It was like adding an extra blanket on a mild night: It took a few minutes before you started to sweat.
  Yet Slade, the director of the Energy Department's carbon-dioxide program, considered the lag a saving grace. If changes did not occur for a decade or more, he said, those in the room couldn't be blamed for failing to prevent them. So what was the problem?
  ''You're the problem,'' Pomerance said. Because of the lag between cause and effect, it was unlikely that humankind would detect hard evidence of warming until it was too late to reverse it. The lag would doom them. ''The U.S. has to do something to gain some credibility,'' he said.
  ''So it is a moral stand,'' Slade replied, sensing an advantage.
  ''Call it whatever.'' Besides, Pomerance added, they didn't have to ban coal tomorrow. A pair of modest steps could be taken immediately to show the world that the United States was serious: the implementation of a carbon tax and increased investment in renewable energy. Then the United States could organize an international summit meeting to address climate change. This was his closing plea to the group. The next day, they would have to draft policy proposals.
  But when the group reconvened after breakfast, they immediately became stuck on a sentence in their prefatory paragraph declaring that climatic changes were ''likely to occur.''
  ''Will occur,'' proposed Laurmann, the Stanford engineer.
  ''What about the words: highly likely to occur?'' Scoville asked.
  ''Almost sure,'' said David Rose, the nuclear engineer from M.I.T.
  ''Almost surely,'' another said.
  ''Changes of an undetermined -- ''
  ''Changes as yet of a little-understood nature?''
  ''Highly or extremely likely to occur,'' Pomerance said.
  ''Almost surely to occur?''
  ''No,'' Pomerance said.
  ''I would like to make one statement,'' said Annemarie Crocetti, a public-health scholar who sat on the National Commission on Air Quality and had barely spoken all week. ''I have noticed that very often when we as scientists are cautious in our statements, everybody else misses the point, because they don't understand our qualifications.''
  ''As a nonscientist,'' said Tom McPherson, the Florida legislator, ''I really concur.''
  Yet these two dozen experts, who agreed on the major points and had made a commitment to Congress, could not draft a single paragraph. Hours passed in a hell of fruitless negotiation, self-defeating proposals and impulsive speechifying. Pomerance and Scoville pushed to include a statement calling for the United States to ''sharply accelerate international dialogue,'' but they were sunk by objections and caveats.
  ''It is very emotional,'' Crocetti said, succumbing to her frustration. ''What we have asked is to get people from different disciplines to come together and tell us what you agree on and what your problems are. And you have only made vague statements -- ''
  She was interrupted by Waltz, the economist, who wanted simply to note that climate change would have profound effects. Crocetti waited until he exhausted himself, before resuming in a calm voice. ''All I am asking you to say is: 'We got ourselves a bunch of experts, and by God, they all endorse this point of view and think it is very important. They have disagreements about the details of this and that, but they feel that it behooves us to intervene at this point and try to prevent it.' ''
  They never got to policy proposals. They never got to the second paragraph. The final statement was signed by only the moderator, who phrased it more weakly than the declaration calling for the workshop in the first place. ''The guide I would suggest,'' Jorling wrote, ''is whether we know enough not to recommend changes in existing policy.''
  Pomerance had seen enough. A consensus-based strategy would not work -- could not work -- without American leadership. And the United States wouldn't act unless a strong leader persuaded it to do so -- someone who would speak with authority about the science, demand action from those in power and risk everything in pursuit of justice. Pomerance knew he wasn't that person: He was an organizer, a strategist, a fixer -- which meant he was an optimist and even, perhaps, a romantic. His job was to assemble a movement. And every movement, even one backed by widespread consensus, needed a hero. He just had to find one.
  6. 'Otherwise, They'll Gurgle' November 1980-September 1981
  The meeting ended Friday morning. On Tuesday, four days later, Ronald Reagan was elected president. And Rafe Pomerance soon found himself wondering whether what had seemed to have been a beginning had actually been the end.
  After the election, Reagan considered plans to close the Energy Department, increase coal production on federal land and deregulate surface coal mining. Once in office, he appointed James Watt, the president of a legal firm that fought to open public lands to mining and drilling, to run the Interior Department. ''We're deliriously happy,'' the president of the National Coal Association was reported to have said. Reagan preserved the E.P.A. but named as its administrator Anne Gorsuch, an anti-regulation zealot who proceeded to cut the agency's staff and budget by about a quarter. In the midst of this carnage, the Council on Environmental Quality submitted a report to the White House warning that fossil fuels could ''permanently and disastrously'' alter Earth's atmosphere, leading to ''a warming of the Earth, possibly with very serious effects.'' Reagan did not act on the council's advice. Instead, his administration considered eliminating the council.
  At the Pink Palace, Anthony Scoville had said that the problem was not atmospheric but political. That was only half right, Pomerance thought. For behind every political problem, there lay a publicity problem. And the climate crisis had a publicity nightmare. The Florida meeting had failed to prepare a coherent statement, let alone legislation, and now everything was going backward. Even Pomerance couldn't devote much time to climate change; Friends of the Earth was busier than ever. The campaigns to defeat the nominations of James Watt and Anne Gorsuch were just the beginning; there were also efforts to block mining in wilderness areas, maintain the Clean Air Act's standards for air pollutants and preserve funding for renewable energy (Reagan ''has declared open war on solar energy,'' the director of the nation's lead solar-energy research agency said, after he was asked to resign). Reagan appeared determined to reverse the environmental achievements of Jimmy Carter, before undoing those of Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson, John F. Kennedy and, if he could get away with it, Theodore Roosevelt.
  Reagan's violence to environmental regulations alarmed even members of his own party. Senator Robert Stafford, a Vermont Republican and chairman of the committee that held confirmation hearings on Gorsuch, took the unusual step of lecturing her from the dais about her moral obligation to protect the nation's air and water. Watt's plan to open the waters off California for oil drilling was denounced by the state's Republican senator, and Reagan's proposal to eliminate the position of science adviser was roundly derided by the scientists and engineers who advised him during his presidential campaign. When Reagan considered closing the Council on Environmental Quality, its acting chairman, Malcolm Forbes Baldwin, wrote to the vice president and the White House chief of staff begging them to reconsider; in a major speech the same week, ''A Conservative's Program for the Environment,'' Baldwin argued that it was ''time for today's conservatives explicitly to embrace environmentalism.'' Environmental protection was not only good sense. It was good business. What could be more conservative than an efficient use of resources that led to fewer federal subsidies?
  Meanwhile the Charney report continued to vibrate at the periphery of public consciousness. Its conclusions were confirmed by major studies from the Aspen Institute, the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis near Vienna and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Every month or so, nationally syndicated articles appeared summoning apocalypse: ''Another Warning on 'Greenhouse Effect,' '' ''Global Warming Trend 'Beyond Human Experience,' '' ''Warming Trend Could 'Pit Nation Against Nation.' '' People magazine had profiled Gordon MacDonald, photographing him standing on the steps of the Capitol and pointing above his head to the level the water would reach when the polar ice caps melted. ''If Gordon MacDonald is wrong, they'll laugh,'' the article read. ''Otherwise, they'll gurgle.''
  But Pomerance understood that in order to sustain major coverage, you needed major events. Studies were fine; speeches were good; news conferences were better. Hearings, however, were best. The ritual's theatrical trappings -- the members of Congress holding forth on the dais, their aides decorously passing notes, the witnesses sipping nervously from their water glasses, the audience transfixed in the gallery -- offered antagonists, dramatic tension, narrative. But you couldn't have a hearing without a scandal, or at least a scientific breakthrough. And two years after the Charney group met at Woods Hole, it seemed there was no more science to break through.
  It was with a shiver of optimism, then, that Pomerance read on the front page of The New York Times on Aug. 22, 1981, about a forthcoming paper in Science by a team of seven NASA scientists. They had found that the world had already warmed in the past century. Temperatures hadn't increased beyond the range of historical averages, but the scientists predicted that the warming signal would emerge from the noise of routine weather fluctuations much sooner than previously expected. Most unusual of all, the paper ended with a policy recommendation: In the coming decades, the authors wrote, humankind should develop alternative sources of energy and use fossil fuels only ''as necessary.'' The lead author was James Hansen.
  Pomerance called Hansen to ask for a meeting. He explained to Hansen that he wanted to make sure he understood the paper's conclusions. But more than that, he wanted to understand James Hansen.
  At the Goddard Institute, Pomerance entered Hansen's office, maneuvering through some 30 piles of documents arrayed across the floor like the skyscrapers of a model city, some as high as his waist. On top of many of the stacks lay a scrap of cardboard on which had been scrawled words like Trace Gases, Ocean, Jupiter, Venus. At the desk, Pomerance found, hidden behind another paper metropolis, a quiet, composed man with a heavy brow and implacable green eyes. Hansen's speech was soft, equable, deliberate to the point of halting. He would have no trouble passing for a small-town accountant, insurance-claims manager or actuary. In a sense he held all of those jobs, only his client was the global atmosphere. Pomerance's political sensitivities sparked. He liked what he saw.
  As Hansen spoke, Pomerance listened and watched. He understood Hansen's basic findings well enough: Earth had been warming since 1880, and the warming would reach ''almost unprecedented magnitude'' in the next century, leading to the familiar suite of terrors, including the flooding of a 10th of New Jersey and a quarter of Louisiana and Florida. But Pomerance was excited to find that Hansen could translate the complexities of atmospheric science into plain English. Though he was something of a wunderkind -- at 40, he was about to be named director of the Goddard Institute -- he spoke with the plain-spoken Midwestern forthrightness that played on Capitol Hill. He presented like a heartland voter, the kind of man interviewed on the evening news about the state of the American dream or photographed in the dying sun against a blurry agricultural landscape in a campaign ad. And unlike most scientists in the field, he was not afraid to follow his research to its policy implications. He was perfect.
  ''What you have to say needs to be heard,'' Pomerance said. ''Are you willing to be a witness?''
  7. 'We're All Going to Be the Victims' March 1982
  Though few people other than Rafe Pomerance seemed to have noticed amid Reagan's environmental blitzkrieg, another hearing on the greenhouse effect was held several weeks earlier, on July 31, 1981. It was led by Representative James Scheuer, a New York Democrat -- who lived at sea level on the Rockaway Peninsula, in a neighborhood no more than four blocks wide, sandwiched between two beaches -- and a canny, 33-year-old congressman named Albert Gore Jr.
  Gore had learned about climate change a dozen years earlier as an undergraduate at Harvard, when he took a class taught by Roger Revelle. Humankind was on the brink of radically transforming the global atmosphere, Revelle explained, drawing Keeling's rising zigzag on the blackboard, and risked bringing about the collapse of civilization. Gore was stunned: Why wasn't anyone talking about this? He had no memory of hearing it from his father, a three-term senator from Tennessee who later served as chairman of an Ohio coal company. Once in office, Gore figured that if Revelle gave Congress the same lecture, his colleagues would be moved to act. Or at least that the hearing would get picked up by one of the three major national news broadcasts.
  Gore's hearing was part of a larger campaign he had designed with his staff director, Tom Grumbly. After winning his third term in 1980, Gore was granted his first leadership position, albeit a modest one: chairman of an oversight subcommittee within the Committee on Science and Technology -- a subcommittee that he had lobbied to create. Most in Congress considered the science committee a legislative backwater, if they considered it at all; this made Gore's subcommittee, which had no legislative authority, an afterthought to an afterthought. That, Gore vowed, would change. Environmental and health stories had all the elements of narrative drama: villains, victims and heroes. In a hearing, you could summon all three, with the chairman serving as narrator, chorus and moral authority. He told his staff director that he wanted to hold a hearing every week.
  It was like storyboarding episodes of a weekly procedural drama. Grumbly assembled a list of subjects that possessed the necessary dramatic elements: a Massachusetts cancer researcher who faked his results, the dangers of excessive salt in the American diet, the disappearance of an airplane on Long Island. All fit Gore's template; all had sizzle. But Gore wondered why Grumbly hadn't included the greenhouse effect.
  There are no villains, Grumbly said. Besides, who's your victim?
  If we don't do something, Gore replied, we're all going to be the victims.
  He didn't say: If we don't do something, we'll be the villains too.
  The Revelle hearing went as Grumbly had predicted. The urgency of the issue was lost on Gore's older colleagues, who drifted in and out while the witnesses testified. There were few people left by the time the Brookings Institution economist Lester Lave warned that humankind's profligate exploitation of fossil fuels posed an existential test to human nature. ''Carbon dioxide stands as a symbol now of our willingness to confront the future,'' he said. ''It will be a sad day when we decide that we just don't have the time or thoughtfulness to address those issues.'' That night, the news programs featured the resolution of the baseball strike, the ongoing budgetary debate and the national surplus of butter.
  But Gore soon found another opening. Congressional staff members on the science committee heard that the White House planned to eliminate the Energy Department's carbon-dioxide program. If they could put a hearing together quickly enough, they could shame the White House before it could go through with its plan. The Times article about Hansen's paper had proved that there was a national audience for the carbon-dioxide problem -- it just had to be framed correctly. Hansen could occupy the role of hero: a mild-mannered scientist who had seen the future and now sought to rouse the world to action. A villain was emerging, too: Fred Koomanoff, Reagan's new director of the Energy Department's carbon-dioxide program, a Bronx native with the manner of a sergeant major and an unconstrained passion for budget-cutting. Each man would testify.
  Hansen did not disclose to Gore's staff that, in late November, he received a letter from Koomanoff declining to fund his climate-modeling research despite a promise from Koomanoff's predecessor. Koomanoff left open the possibility of funding other carbon-dioxide research, but Hansen was not optimistic, and when his funding lapsed, he had to release five employees, half his staff. Koomanoff, it seemed, would not be moved. But the hearing would give Hansen the chance to appeal directly to the congressmen who oversaw Koomanoff's budget.
  Hansen flew to Washington to testify on March 25, 1982, performing before a gallery even more thinly populated than at Gore's first hearing on the greenhouse effect. Gore began by attacking the Reagan administration for cutting funding for carbon-dioxide research despite the ''broad consensus in the scientific community that the greenhouse effect is a reality.'' William Carney, a Republican from New York, bemoaned the burning of fossil fuels and argued passionately that science should serve as the basis for legislative policy. Bob Shamansky, a Democrat from Ohio, objected to the use of the term ''greenhouse effect'' for such a horrifying phenomenon, because he had always enjoyed visiting greenhouses. ''Everything,'' he said, ''seems to flourish in there.'' He suggested that they call it the ''microwave oven'' effect, ''because we are not flourishing too well under this; apparently, we are getting cooked.''
  There emerged, despite the general comity, a partisan divide. Unlike the Democrats, the Republicans demanded action. ''Today I have a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu,'' said Robert Walker, a Republican from Pennsylvania. In each of the last five years, he said, ''we have been told and told and told that there is a problem with the increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We all accept that fact, and we realize that the potential consequences are certainly major in their impact on mankind.'' Yet they had failed to propose a single law. ''Now is the time,'' he said. ''The research is clear. It is up to us now to summon the political will.''
  Gore disagreed: A higher degree of certainty was required, he believed, in order to persuade a majority of Congress to restrict the use of fossil fuels. The reforms required were of such magnitude and sweep that they ''would challenge the political will of our civilization.''
  Yet the experts invited by Gore agreed with the Republicans: The science was certain enough. Melvin Calvin, a Berkeley chemist who won the Nobel Prize for his work on the carbon cycle, said that it was useless to wait for stronger evidence of warming. ''You cannot do a thing about it when the signals are so big that they come out of the noise,'' he said. ''You have to look for early warning signs.''
  Hansen's job was to share the warning signs, to translate the data into plain English. He explained a few discoveries that his team had made -- not with computer models but in libraries. By analyzing records from hundreds of weather stations, he found that the surface temperature of the planet had already increased four-tenths of a degree Celsius in the previous century. Data from several hundred tide-gauge stations showed that the oceans had risen four inches since the 1880s. Most disturbing of all, century-old glass astronomy plates had revealed a new problem: Some of the more obscure greenhouse gases -- especially chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, a class of man-made substances used in refrigerators and spray cans -- had proliferated wildly in recent years. ''We may already have in the pipeline a larger amount of climate change than people generally realize,'' Hansen told the nearly empty room.
  Gore asked when the planet would reach a point of no return -- a ''trigger point,'' after which temperatures would spike. ''I want to know,'' Gore said, ''whether I am going to face it or my kids are going to face it.''
  ''Your kids are likely to face it,'' Calvin replied. ''I don't know whether you will or not. You look pretty young.''
  It occurred to Hansen that this was the only political question that mattered: How long until the worst began? It was not a question on which geophysicists expended much effort; the difference between five years and 50 years in the future was meaningless in geologic time. Politicians were capable of thinking only in terms of electoral time: six years, four years, two years. But when it came to the carbon problem, the two time schemes were converging.
  ''Within 10 or 20 years,'' Hansen said, ''we will see climate changes which are clearly larger than the natural variability.''
  James Scheuer wanted to make sure he understood this correctly. No one else had predicted that the signal would emerge that quickly. ''If it were one or two degrees per century,'' he said, ''that would be within the range of human adaptability. But we are pushing beyond the range of human adaptability.''
  ''Yes,'' Hansen said.
  How soon, Scheuer asked, would they have to change the national model of energy production?
  Hansen hesitated -- it wasn't a scientific question. But he couldn't help himself. He had been irritated, during the hearing, by all the ludicrous talk about the possibility of growing more trees to offset emissions. False hopes were worse than no hope at all: They undermined the prospect of developing real solutions.
  ''That time is very soon,'' Hansen said finally.
  ''My opinion is that it is past,'' Calvin said, but he was not heard because he spoke from his seat. He was told to speak into the microphone.
  ''It is already later,'' Calvin said, ''than you think.''
  8. 'The Direction of an Impending Catastrophe' 1982
  From Gore's perspective, the hearing was an unequivocal success. That night Dan Rather devoted three minutes of ''CBS Evening News'' to the greenhouse effect. A correspondent explained that temperatures had increased over the previous century, great sheets of pack ice in Antarctica were rapidly melting, the seas were rising; Calvin said that ''the trend is all in the direction of an impending catastrophe''; and Gore mocked Reagan for his shortsightedness. Later, Gore could take credit for protecting the Energy Department's carbon-dioxide program, which in the end was largely preserved.
  But Hansen did not get new funding for his carbon-dioxide research. He wondered whether he had been doomed by his testimony or by his conclusion, in the Science paper, that full exploitation of coal resources -- a stated goal of Reagan's energy policy -- was ''undesirable.'' Whatever the cause, he found himself alone. He knew he had done nothing wrong -- he had only done diligent research and reported his findings, first to his peers, then to the American people. But now it seemed as if he was being punished for it.
  Anniek could read his disappointment, but she was not entirely displeased. Jim cut down on his work hours, leaving the Goddard Institute at 5 o'clock each day, which allowed him to coach his children's basketball and baseball teams. (He was a patient, committed coach, detail-oriented, if a touch too competitive for his wife's liking.) At home, Jim spoke only about the teams and their fortunes, keeping to himself his musings -- whether he would be able to secure federal funding for his climate experiments, whether the institute would be forced to move its office to Maryland to cut costs.
  But perhaps there were other ways forward. Not long after Hansen laid off five of his assistants, a major symposium he was helping to organize received overtures from a funding partner far wealthier and less ideologically blinkered than the Reagan administration: Exxon. Following Henry Shaw's recommendation to establish credibility ahead of any future legislative battles, Exxon had begun to spend conspicuously on global-warming research. It donated tens of thousands of dollars to some of the most prominent research efforts, including one at Woods Hole led by the ecologist George Woodwell, who had been calling for major climate policy as early as the mid-1970s, and an international effort coordinated by the United Nations. Now Shaw offered to fund the October 1982 symposium on climate change at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty campus.
  As an indication of the seriousness with which Exxon took the issue, Shaw sent Edward David Jr., the president of the research division and the former science adviser to Nixon. Hansen was glad for the support. He figured that Exxon's contributions might go well beyond picking up the bill for travel expenses, lodging and a dinner for dozens of scientists at the colonial-style Clinton Inn in Tenafly, N.J. As a gesture of appreciation, David was invited to give the keynote address.
  There were moments in David's speech in which he seemed to channel Rafe Pomerance. David boasted that Exxon would usher in a new global energy system to save the planet from the ravages of climate change. He went so far as to argue that capitalism's blind faith in the wisdom of the free market was ''less than satisfying'' when it came to the greenhouse effect. Ethical considerations were necessary, too. He pledged that Exxon would revise its corporate strategy to account for climate change, even if it were not ''fashionable'' to do so. As Exxon had already made heavy investments in nuclear and solar technology, he was ''generally upbeat'' that Exxon would ''invent'' a future of renewable energy.
  Hansen had reason to feel upbeat himself. If the world's largest oil-and-gas company supported a new national energy model, the White House would not stand in its way. The Reagan administration was hostile to change from within its ranks. But it couldn't be hostile to Exxon.
  It seemed that something was beginning to turn. With the carbon-dioxide problem as with other environmental crises, the Reagan administration had alienated many of its own supporters. The early demonstrations of autocratic force had retreated into compromise and deference. By the end of 1982, multiple congressional committees were investigating Anne Gorsuch for her indifference to enforcing the cleanup of Superfund sites, and the House voted to hold her in contempt of Congress; Republicans in Congress turned on James Watt after he eliminated thousands of acres of land from consideration for wilderness designation. Each cabinet member would resign within a year.
  The carbon-dioxide issue was beginning to receive major national attention -- Hansen's own findings had become front-page news, after all. What started as a scientific story was turning into a political story. This prospect would have alarmed Hansen several years earlier; it still made him uneasy. But he was beginning to understand that politics offered freedoms that the rigors of the scientific ethic denied. The political realm was itself a kind of Mirror World, a parallel reality that crudely mimicked our own. It shared many of our most fundamental laws, like the laws of gravity and inertia and publicity. And if you applied enough pressure, the Mirror World of politics could be sped forward to reveal a new future. Hansen was beginning to understand that too.
  Part Two 1983--1989
  1. 'Caution, Not Panic' 1983-1984
  From a stray comment in an obscure coal report to portentous front-page headlines in the national press and hearings on Capitol Hill -- in just three years, Rafe Pomerance had watched as an issue considered esoteric even within the scientific community rose nearly to the level of action, the level at which congressmen made statements like, ''It is up to us now to summon the political will.'' Then, overnight, it died. Pomerance knew, from tired experience, that politics didn't move in a straight line, but jaggedly, like the Keeling curve -- a slow progression interrupted by sharp seasonal declines. But in the fall of 1983, the climate issue entered an especially long, dark winter. And all because of a single report that had done nothing to change the state of climate science but transformed the state of climate politics.
  After the publication of the Charney report in 1979, Jimmy Carter had directed the National Academy of Sciences to prepare a comprehensive, $1 million analysis of the carbon-dioxide problem: a Warren Commission for the greenhouse effect. A team of scientist-dignitaries -- among them Revelle, the Princeton modeler Syukuro Manabe and the Harvard political economist Thomas Schelling, one of the intellectual architects of Cold War game theory -- would review the literature, evaluate the consequences of global warming for the world order and propose remedies. Then Reagan won the White House.
  For the next three years, as the commission continued its work -- drawing upon the help of about 70 experts from the fields of atmospheric chemistry, economics and political science, including veterans of the Charney group and the Manhattan Project -- the incipient report served as the Reagan administration's answer to every question on the subject. There could be no climate policy, Fred Koomanoff and his associates said, until the academy ruled. In the Mirror World of the Reagan administration, the warming problem hadn't been abandoned at all. A careful, comprehensive solution was being devised. Everyone just had to wait for the academy's elders to explain what it was.
  On Oct. 19, 1983, the commission finally announced its findings at a formal gala, preceded by cocktails and dinner in the academy's cruciform Great Hall, a secular Sistine Chapel, with vaulted ceilings soaring to a dome painted as the sun. An inscription encircling the sun honored science as the ''pilot of industry,'' and the academy had invited the nation's foremost pilots of industry: Andrew Callegari, the head of Exxon's carbon-dioxide research program, and vice presidents from Peabody Coal, General Motors and the Synthetic Fuels Corporation. They were eager to learn how the United States planned to act, so they could prepare for the inevitable policy debates. Rafe Pomerance was eager, too. But he wasn't invited.
  He did manage, however, to get into a crowded press briefing earlier that day, where he grabbed a copy of the 500-page report, ''Changing Climate,'' and scanned its contents. Its scope was impressive: It was the first study to encompass the causes, effects and geopolitical consequences of climate change. But as he flipped through, Pomerance surmised that it offered no significant new findings -- nothing that wasn't in the Charney report or the blue-ribbon studies that had been published since. ''We are deeply concerned about environmental changes of this magnitude,'' read the executive summary. ''We may get into trouble in ways that we have barely imagined.''
  The authors did try to imagine some of them: an ice-free Arctic, for instance, and Boston sinking into its harbor, Beacon Hill an island two miles off the coast. There was speculation about political revolution, trade wars and a long quotation from ''A Distant Mirror,'' a medieval history written by Pomerance's aunt, Barbara Tuchman, describing how climate changes in the 14th century led to ''people eating their own children'' and ''feeding on hanged bodies taken down from the gibbet.'' The committee's chairman, William Nierenberg -- a Jason, presidential adviser and director of Scripps, the nation's pre-eminent oceanographic institution -- argued that action had to be taken immediately, before all the details could be known with certainty, or else it would be too late.
  That's what Nierenberg wrote in ''Changing Climate.'' But it's not what he said in the press interviews that followed. He argued the opposite: There was no urgent need for action. The public should not entertain the most ''extreme negative speculations'' about climate change (despite the fact that many of those speculations appeared in his report). Though ''Changing Climate'' urged an accelerated transition to renewable fuels, noting that it would take thousands of years for the atmosphere to recover from the damage of the last century, Nierenberg recommended ''caution, not panic.'' Better to wait and see. Better to bet on American ingenuity to save the day. Major interventions in national energy policy, taken immediately, might end up being more expensive, and less effective, than actions taken decades in the future, after more was understood about the economic and social consequences of a warmer planet. Yes, the climate would change, mostly for the worst, but future generations would be better equipped to change with it.
  As Pomerance listened at the briefing to the commission's appeasements, he glanced, baffled, around the room. The reporters and staff members listened politely to the presentation and took dutiful notes, as at any technical briefing. Government officials who knew Nierenberg were not surprised by his conclusions: He was an optimist by training and experience, a devout believer in the doctrine of American exceptionalism, one of the elite class of scientists who had helped the nation win a global war, invent the most deadly weapon conceivable and create the booming aerospace and computer industries. America had solved every existential problem it had confronted over the previous generation; it would not be daunted by an excess of carbon dioxide. Nierenberg had also served on Reagan's transition team. Nobody believed that he had been directly influenced by his political connections, but his views -- optimistic about the saving graces of market forces, pessimistic about the value of government regulation -- reflected all the ardor of his party.
  Pomerance, who came of age during the Vietnam War and the birth of the environmental movement, shared none of Nierenberg's Procrustean faith in American ingenuity. He worried about the dark undertow of industrial advancement, the way every new technological superpower carried within it unintended consequences that, if unchecked over time, eroded the foundations of society. New technologies had not solved the clean-air and clean-water crises of the 1970s. Activism and organization, leading to robust government regulation, had. Listening to the commission's equivocations, Pomerance shook his head, rolled his eyes, groaned. He felt that he was the only sane person in a briefing room gone mad. It was wrong. A colleague told him to calm down.
  The damage of ''Changing Climate'' was squared by the amount of attention it received. Nierenberg's speech in the Great Hall, being one-500th the length of the actual assessment, received 500 times the press coverage. As The Wall Street Journal put it, in a line echoed by trade journals across the nation: ''A panel of top scientists has some advice for people worried about the much-publicized warming of the Earth's climate: You can cope.'' The effusiveness of Nierenberg's reassurances invited derision. On ''CBS Evening News,'' Dan Rather said the academy had given ''a cold shoulder'' to a grim, 200-page E.P.A. assessment published earlier that week (titled ''Can We Delay a Greenhouse Warming?''; the E.P.A.'s answer, reduced to a word, was no). The Washington Post described the two reports, taken together, as ''clarion calls to inaction.''
  On its front page, The New York Times published its most prominent piece on global warming to date, under the headline ''Haste on Global Warming Trend Is Opposed.'' Although the paper included an excerpt from ''Changing Climate'' that detailed some of the report's gloomier predictions, the article itself gave the greatest weight to a statement, heavily workshopped by the White House's senior staff, from George Keyworth II, Reagan's science adviser. Keyworth used Nierenberg's optimism as reason to discount the E.P.A.'s ''unwarranted and unnecessarily alarmist'' report and warned against taking any ''near-term corrective action'' on global warming. Just in case it wasn't clear, Keyworth added, ''there are no actions recommended other than continued research.''
  Exxon soon revised its position on climate-change research. In a presentation at an industry conference, Henry Shaw cited ''Changing Climate'' as evidence that ''the general consensus is that society has sufficient time to technologically adapt to a COâ‚‚ greenhouse effect.'' If the academy had concluded that regulations were not a serious option, why should Exxon protest? Edward David Jr., two years removed from boasting of Exxon's commitment to transforming global energy policy, told Science that the corporation had reconsidered. ''Exxon has reverted to being mainly a supplier of conventional hydrocarbon fuels -- petroleum products, natural gas and steam coal,'' David said. The American Petroleum Institute canceled its own carbon-dioxide research program, too.
  A few months after the publication of ''Changing Climate,'' Pomerance announced his resignation from Friends of the Earth. He had various reasons: He had struggled with the politics of managing a staff and a board, and the environmental movement from which the organization had emerged in the early '70s was in crisis. It lacked a unifying cause. Climate change, Pomerance believed, could be that cause. But its insubstantiality made it difficult to rally the older activists, whose strategic model relied on protests at sites of horrific degradation -- Love Canal, Hetch Hetchy, Three Mile Island. How did you protest when the toxic waste dump was the entire planet or, worse, its invisible atmosphere?
  Observing her husband, Lenore Pomerance was reminded of an old Philadelphia Bulletin ad campaign: ''In Philadelphia -- nearly everyone reads The Bulletin.'' On a crowded beach, all the sunbathers have their faces buried in their newspapers, except for one man, who stares off into the distance. Here the scenario was reversed: Rafe, the loner, was staring down the world's largest problem while everyone else was distracted by the minutiae of daily life. Pomerance acted cheerful at home, fooling his kids. But he couldn't fool Lenore. She worried about his health. Near the end of his tenure at Friends of the Earth, a doctor found that he had an abnormally high heart rate.
  Pomerance planned to take a couple of months to reflect on what he wanted to do with the rest of his life. Two months stretched to about a year. He brooded; he checked out. He spent weeks at a time at an old farmhouse that he and Lenore owned in West Virginia, near Seneca Rocks. When they bought it in the early '70s, the house had a wood-burning stove and no running water. To make a phone call on a private line, you had drive to the operator's house and hope she was in. Pomerance sat in the cold house and thought.
  The winter took him back to his childhood in Greenwich. He had a vivid memory of being taught by his mother to ice skate on a frozen pond a short walk from their home. He remembered the muffled hush of twilight, the snow dusting the ice, the ghostly clearing encircled by a wood darker than the night. Their house was designed by his father, an architect whose glass-enveloped buildings mocked the vanity of humankind's efforts to improve on nature; the windows invited the elements inside, the trees and the ice and, in the rattling of the broad panes, the wind. Winter, Pomerance believed, was part of his soul. When he thought about the future, he worried about the loss of ice, the loss of the spiky Connecticut January mornings. He worried about the loss of some irreplaceable part of himself.
  He wanted to recommit himself to the fight but couldn't figure out how. If science, industry and the press could not move the government to act, then who could? He didn't see what was left for him, or anyone else, to do. He didn't see that the answer was at that moment floating over his head, about 10 miles above his West Virginian farmhouse, just above the highest clouds in the sky.
  2. 'You Scientists Win' 1985
  It was as if, without warning, the sky opened and the sun burst through in all its irradiating, blinding fury. The mental image was of a pin stuck through a balloon, a chink in an eggshell, a crack in the ceiling -- Armageddon descending from above. It was a sudden global emergency: There was a hole in the ozone layer.
  The klaxon was rung by a team of British government scientists, until then little known in the field, who made regular visits to research stations in Antarctica -- one on the Argentine Islands, the other on a sheet of ice floating into the sea at the rate of a quarter mile per year. At each site, the scientists had set up a machine invented in the 1920s called the Dobson spectrophotometer, which resembled a large slide projector turned with its eye staring straight up. After several years of results so alarming that they disbelieved their own evidence, the British scientists at last reported their discovery in an article published in May 1985 by Nature. ''The spring values of total Oâ‚ƒ in Antarctica have now fallen considerably,'' the abstract read. But by the time the news filtered into national headlines and television broadcasts several months later, it had transfigured into something far more terrifying: a substantial increase in skin cancer, a sharp decline in the global agricultural yield and the mass death of fish larva, near the base of the marine food chain. Later came fears of atrophied immune systems and blindness.
  The urgency of the alarm seemed to have everything to do with the phrase ''a hole in the ozone layer,'' which, charitably put, was a mixed metaphor. For there was no hole, and there was no layer. Ozone, which shielded Earth from ultraviolet radiation, was distributed throughout the atmosphere, settling mostly in the middle stratosphere and never in a concentration higher than 15 parts per million. As for the ''hole'' -- while the amount of ozone over Antarctica had declined drastically, the depletion was a temporary phenomenon, lasting about two months a year. In satellite images colorized to show ozone density, however, the darker region appeared to depict a void. When F.Sherwood Rowland, one of the chemists who identified the problem in 1974, spoke of the ''ozone hole'' in a university slide lecture in November 1985, the crisis found its catchphrase. The New York Times used it that same day in its article about the British team's findings, and while scientific journals initially refused to use the term, within a year it was unavoidable. The ozone crisis had its signal, which was also a symbol: a hole.
  It was already understood, thanks to the work of Rowland and his colleague Mario Molina, that the damage was largely caused by the man-made CFCs used in refrigerators, spray bottles and plastic foams, which escaped into the stratosphere and devoured ozone molecules. It was also understood that the ozone problem and the greenhouse-gas problem were linked. CFCs were unusually potent greenhouse gases. Though CFCs had been mass-produced only since the 1930s, they were already responsible, by Jim Hansen's calculation, for nearly half of Earth's warming during the 1970s. But nobody was worried about CFCs because of their warming potential. They were worried about getting skin cancer.
  The United Nations, through two of its intergovernmental agencies -- the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization -- had in 1977 established a World Plan of Action on the Ozone Layer. In 1985, UNEP adopted a framework for a global treaty, the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer. The negotiators failed to agree upon any specific CFC regulations in Vienna, but after the British scientists reported their findings from the Antarctic two months later, the Reagan administration proposed a reduction in CFC emissions of 95 percent. The speed of the reversal was all the more remarkable because CFC regulation faced virulent opposition. Dozens of American businesses with the word ''refrigeration'' in their names, together with hundreds involved in the production, manufacture and consumption of chemicals, plastics, paper goods and frozen food -- around 500 companies in total, from DuPont and the American Petroleum Institute to Mrs. Smith's Frozen Food Company of Pottstown, Pa. -- had united in 1980 as the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy. The alliance hounded the E.P.A., members of Congress and Reagan himself, insisting that ozone science was uncertain. The few concessions the alliance won, like forcing the E.P.A. to withdraw a plan to regulate CFCs, were swiftly overturned by lawsuits, and once the public discovered the ''ozone hole,'' every relevant government agency and every sitting United States senator urged the president to endorse the United Nations' plans for a treaty. When Reagan finally submitted the Vienna Convention to the Senate for ratification, he praised the ''leading role'' played by the United States, fooling nobody.
  Senior members of the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization, including Bert Bolin, a veteran of the Charney group, began to wonder whether they could do for the carbon-dioxide problem what they had done for ozone policy. The organizations had been holding semiannual conferences on global warming since the early 1970s. But in 1985, just several months after the bad news from the Antarctic, at an otherwise sleepy meeting in Villach, Austria, the assembled 89 scientists from 29 countries began to discuss a subject that fell wildly outside their discipline: politics.
  An Irish hydrology expert asked if his country should reconsider the location of its dams. A Dutch seacoast engineer questioned the wisdom of rebuilding dikes that had been destroyed by recent floods. And the conference's chairman, James Bruce, an unassuming, pragmatic hydrometeorologist from Ontario, posed a question that shocked his audience.
  Bruce was a minister of the Canadian environmental agency, a position that conferred him the esteem that his American counterparts had forfeited when Reagan won the White House. Just before leaving for Villach, he met with provincial dam and hydropower managers. O.K., one of them said, you scientists win. You've convinced me that the climate is changing. Well, tell me how it's changing. In 20 years, will the rain be falling somewhere else?
  Bruce took this challenge to Villach: You're the experts. What am I supposed to tell him? People are hearing the message, and they want to hear more. So how do we, in the scientific world, begin a dialogue with the world of action?
  The world of action. For a room of scientists who prided themselves as belonging to a specialized guild of monkish austerity, this was a startling provocation. On a bus tour of the countryside, commissioned by their Austrian hosts, Bruce sat with Roger Revelle, ignoring the Alps, speaking animatedly about the need for scientists to demand political remedies in times of existential crisis.
  The formal report ratified at Villach contained the most forceful warnings yet issued by a scientific body. Most major economic decisions undertaken by nations, it pointed out, were based on the assumption that past climate conditions were a reliable guide to the future. But the future would not look like the past. Though some warming was inevitable, the scientists wrote, the extent of the disaster could be ''profoundly affected'' by aggressive, coordinated government policies. Fortunately there was a new model in place to achieve just that. The balloon could be patched, the eggshell bandaged, the ceiling replastered. There was still time.
  3. The Size of The Human Imagination Spring-Summer 1986
  It was the spring of 1986, and Curtis Moore, a Republican staff member on the Committee on Environment and Public Works, was telling Rafe Pomerance that the greenhouse effect wasn't a problem.
  With his last ounce of patience, Pomerance begged to disagree.
  Yes, Moore clarified -- of course, it was an existential problem, the fate of the civilization depended on it, the oceans would boil, all of that. But it wasn't a political problem. Know how you could tell? Political problems had solutions. And the climate issue had none. Without a solution -- an obvious, attainable one -- any policy could only fail. No elected politician desired to come within shouting distance of failure. So when it came to the dangers of despoiling our planet beyond the range of habitability, most politicians didn't see a problem. Which meant that Pomerance had a very big problem indeed.
  He had followed the rapid ascension of the ozone issue with the rueful admiration of a competitor. He was thrilled for its success -- however inadvertently, the treaty would serve as the world's first action to delay climate change. But it offered an especially acute challenge for Pomerance, who after his yearlong hiatus had become, as far as he knew, the nation's first, and only, full-time global-warming lobbyist. At the suggestion of Gordon MacDonald, Pomerance joined the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit begun by Gus Speth, a senior environmental official in Jimmy Carter's White House and a founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Unlike Friends of the Earth, W.R.I. was not an activist organization; it occupied the nebulous intersection of politics, international relations and energy policy. Its mission was expansive enough to allow Pomerance to work without interference. Yet the only thing that anyone on Capitol Hill wanted to talk about was ozone.
  That was Curtis Moore's proposal: Use ozone to revive climate. The ozone hole had a solution -- an international treaty, already in negotiation. Why not hitch the milk wagon to the bullet train? Pomerance was skeptical. The problems were related, sure: Without a reduction in CFC emissions, you didn't have a chance of averting cataclysmic global warming. But it had been difficult enough to explain the carbon issue to politicians and journalists; why complicate the sales pitch? Then again, he didn't see what choice he had. The Republicans controlled the Senate, and Moore was his connection to the Senate's environmental committee.
  Moore came through. At his suggestion, Pomerance met with Senator John Chafee, a Republican from Rhode Island, and helped persuade him to hold a double-barreled hearing on the twin problems of ozone and carbon dioxide on June 10 and 11, 1986. F.Sherwood Rowland, Robert Watson, a NASA scientist, and Richard Benedick, the administration's lead representative in international ozone negotiations, would discuss ozone; James Hansen, Al Gore, the ecologist George Woodwell and Carl Wunsch, a veteran of the Charney group, would testify about climate change. As soon as the first witness appeared, Pomerance realized that Moore's instincts had been right. The ozone gang was good.
  Robert Watson dimmed the lights in the hearing room. On a flimsy screen, he projected footage with the staticky, low-budget quality of a slasher flick. It showed a bird's-eye view of the Antarctic, partly obscured by spiraling clouds. The footage was so convincing that Chafee had to ask whether it was an actual satellite image. Watson acknowledged that though created by satellite data, it was, in fact, a simulation. An animation, to be precise. The three-minute video showed every day of October -- the month during which the ozone thinned most drastically -- for seven consecutive years. (The other months, conveniently, were omitted.) A canny filmmaker had colored the ''ozone hole'' pink. As the years sped forward, the polar vortex madly gyroscoping, the hole expanded until it obscured most of Antarctica. The smudge turned mauve, representing an even thinner density of ozone, and then the dark purple of a hemorrhaging wound. The data represented in the video wasn't new, but nobody had thought to represent it in this medium. If F.Sherwood Rowland's earlier colorized images were crime-scene photographs, Watson's video was a surveillance camera catching the killer red-handed.
  As Pomerance had hoped, fear about the ozone layer ensured a bounty of press coverage for the climate-change testimony. But as he had feared, it caused many people to conflate the two crises. One was Peter Jennings, who aired the video on ABC's ''World News Tonight,'' warning that the ozone hole ''could lead to flooding all over the world, also to drought and to famine.''
  The confusion helped: For the first time since the ''Changing Climate'' report, global-warming headlines appeared by the dozen. William Nierenberg's ''caution, not panic'' line was inverted. It was all panic without a hint of caution: ''A Dire Forecast for 'Greenhouse' Earth'' (the front page of The Washington Post); ''Scientists Predict Catastrophes in Growing Global Heat Wave'' (Chicago Tribune); ''Swifter Warming of Globe Foreseen'' (The New York Times). On the second day of the Senate hearing, devoted to global warming, every seat in the gallery was occupied; four men squeezed together on a broad window sill.
  Pomerance had suggested that Chafee, instead of opening with the typical statement about the need for more research, deliver a call for action. But Chafee went further: He called for the State Department to begin negotiations on an international solution with the Soviet Union. It was the kind of proposal that would have been unthinkable even a year earlier, but the ozone issue had established a precedent for global environmental problems: high-level meetings among the world's most powerful nations, followed by a global summit meeting to negotiate a framework for a treaty to restrict emissions.
  After three years of backsliding and silence, Pomerance was exhilarated to see interest in the issue spike overnight. Not only that: A solution materialized, and a moral argument was passionately articulated -- by Rhode Island's Republican senator no less. ''Ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect can no longer be treated solely as important scientific questions,'' Chafee said. ''They must be seen as critical problems facing the nations of the world, and they are problems that demand solutions.''
  The old canard about the need for more research was roundly mocked -- by Woodwell, by a W.R.I. colleague named Andrew Maguire, by Senator George Mitchell, a Democrat from Maine. ''Scientists are never 100 percent certain,'' the Princeton historian Theodore Rabb testified. ''That notion of total certainty is something too elusive ever to be sought.'' As Pomerance had been saying since 1979, it was past time to act. Only now the argument was so broadly accepted that nobody dared object.
  The ozone hole, Pomerance realized, had moved the public because, though it was no more visible than global warming, people could be made to see it. They could watch it grow on video. Its metaphors were emotionally wrought: Instead of summoning a glass building that sheltered plants from chilly weather (''Everything seems to flourish in there''), the hole evoked a violent rending of the firmament, inviting deathly radiation. Americans felt that their lives were in danger. An abstract, atmospheric problem had been reduced to the size of the human imagination. It had been made just small enough, and just large enough, to break through.
  4. 'Atmospheric Scientist, New York, N.Y.' Fall 1987-Spring 1988
  Four years after ''Changing Climate,'' two years after a hole had torn open the firmament and a month after the United States and more than three dozen other nations signed a treaty to limit use of CFCs, the climate-change corps was ready to celebrate. It had become conventional wisdom that climate change would follow ozone's trajectory. Reagan's E.P.A. administrator, Lee M. Thomas, said as much the day he signed the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer (the successor to the Vienna Convention), telling reporters that global warming was likely to be the subject of a future international agreement. Congress had already begun to consider policy -- in 1987 alone, there were eight days of climate hearings, in three committees, across both chambers of Congress; Senator Joe Biden, a Delaware Democrat, had introduced legislation to establish a national climate-change strategy. And so it was that Jim Hansen found himself on Oct. 27 in the not especially distinguished ballroom of the Quality Inn on New Jersey Avenue, a block from the Capitol, at ''Preparing for Climate Change,'' which was technically a conference but felt more like a wedding.
  The convivial mood had something to do with its host. John Topping was an old-line Rockefeller Republican, a Commerce Department lawyer under Nixon and an E.P.A. official under Reagan. He first heard about the climate problem in the halls of the E.P.A. in 1982 and sought out Hansen, who gave him a personal tutorial. Topping was amazed to discover that out of the E.P.A.'s 13,000-person staff, only seven people, by his count, were assigned to work on climate, though he figured it was more important to the long-term security of the nation than every other environmental issue combined. After leaving the administration, he founded a nonprofit organization, the Climate Institute, to bring together scientists, politicians and businesspeople to discuss policy solutions. He didn't have any difficulty raising $150,000 to hold ''Preparing for Climate Change''; the major sponsors included BP America, General Electric and the American Gas Association. Topping's industry friends were intrigued. If a guy like Topping thought this greenhouse business was important, they'd better see what it was all about.
  Glancing around the room, Jim Hansen could chart, like an arborist counting rings on a stump, the growth of the climate issue over the decade. Veterans like Gordon MacDonald, George Woodwell and the environmental biologist Stephen Schneider stood at the center of things. Former and current staff members from the congressional science committees (Tom Grumbly, Curtis Moore, Anthony Scoville) made introductions to the congressmen they advised. Hansen's owlish nemesis Fred Koomanoff was present, as were his counterparts from the Soviet Union and Western Europe. Rafe Pomerance's cranium could be seen above the crowd, but unusually he was surrounded by colleagues from other environmental organizations that until now had shown little interest in a diffuse problem with no proven fund-raising record. The party's most conspicuous newcomers, however, the outermost ring, were the oil-and-gas executives.
  It was not entirely surprising to see envoys from Exxon, the Gas Research Institute and the electrical-grid trade groups, even if they had been silent since ''Changing Climate.'' But they were joined by executives from General Electric, AT&T and the American Petroleum Institute, which that spring had invited a leading government scientist to make the case for a transition to renewable energy at the industry's annual world conference in Houston. Even Richard Barnett was there, the chairman of the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy, the face of the campaign to defeat an ozone treaty. Barnett's retreat had been humiliating and swift: After DuPont, by far the world's single largest manufacturer of CFCs, realized that it stood to profit from the transition to replacement chemicals, the alliance abruptly reversed its position, demanding that the United States sign a treaty as soon as possible. Now Barnett, at the Quality Inn, was speaking about how ''we bask in the glory of the Montreal Protocol'' and quoting Robert Frost's ''The Road Not Taken'' to express his hope for a renewed alliance between industry and environmentalists. There were more than 250 people in all in the old ballroom, and if the concentric rings extended any further, you would have needed a larger hotel.
  That evening, as a storm spat and coughed outside, Rafe Pomerance gave one of his exhortative speeches urging cooperation among the various factions, and John Chafee and Roger Revelle received awards; introductions were made and business cards earnestly exchanged. Not even a presentation by Hansen of his research could sour the mood. The next night, on Oct. 28, at a high-spirited dinner party in Topping's townhouse on Capitol Hill, the oil-and-gas men joked with the environmentalists, the trade-group representatives chatted up the regulators and the academics got merrily drunk. Mikhail Budyko, the don of the Soviet climatologists, settled into an extended conversation about global warming with Topping's 10-year-old son. It all seemed like the start of a grand bargain, a uniting of factions -- a solution.
  It was perhaps because of all this good cheer that it was Hansen's instinct to shrug off a peculiar series of events that took place just a week later. He was scheduled to appear before another Senate hearing, this time devoted entirely to climate change. It was called by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources after Rafe Pomerance and Gordon MacDonald persuaded its chairman, Bennett Johnston, a Democrat from Louisiana, of the issue's significance for the future of the oil-and-gas industry (Louisiana ranked third among states in oil production). Hansen was accustomed to the bureaucratic nuisances that attended testifying before Congress; before a hearing, he had to send his formal statement to NASA headquarters, which forwarded it to the White House's Office of Management and Budget for approval. ''Major greenhouse climate changes are a certainty,'' he had written. ''By the 2010s [in every scenario], essentially the entire globe has very substantial warming.''
  The process appeared entirely perfunctory, but this time, on the Friday evening before his appearance that Monday, he was informed that the White House demanded changes to his testimony. No rationale was provided. Nor did Hansen understand by what authority it could censor scientific findings. He told the administrator in NASA's legislative-affairs office that he refused to make the changes. If that meant he couldn't testify, so be it.
  The NASA administrator had another idea. The Office of Management and Budget had the authority to approve government witnesses, she explained. But it couldn't censor a private citizen.
  At the hearing three days later, on Monday, Nov. 9, Hansen was listed as ''Atmospheric Scientist, New York, N.Y. '' -- as if he were a crank with a telescope who had stumbled into the Senate off the street. He was careful to emphasize the absurdity of the situation in his opening remarks, at least to the degree that his Midwestern reserve would allow: ''Before I begin, I would like to state that although I direct the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, I am appearing here as a private citizen.'' In the most understated terms available to him, Hansen provided his credentials: ''Ten years' experience in terrestrial climate studies and more than 10 years' experience in the exploration and study of other planetary atmospheres.''
  Assuming that one of the senators would immediately ask about this odd introduction, Hansen had prepared an elegant response. He planned to say that although his NASA colleagues endorsed his findings, the White House had insisted he utter false statements that would have distorted his conclusions. He figured this would lead to an uproar. But no senator thought to ask about his title. So the atmospheric scientist from New York City said nothing else about it.
  After the hearing, he went to lunch with John Topping, who was stunned to hear of the White House's ham-handed attempt to silence him. ''Uh, oh,'' Topping joked, ''Jim is a dangerous man. We're going to have to rally the troops to protect him.'' The idea that quiet, sober Jim Hansen could be seen as a threat to anyone, let alone national security -- well, it was enough to make him laugh.
  But the brush with state censorship stayed with Hansen in the months ahead. It confirmed that even after the political triumph of the Montreal Protocol and the bipartisan support of climate policy, there were still people within the White House who hoped to prevent a debate. In its public statements, the administration showed no such reluctance: By all appearances, plans for major policy continued to advance rapidly. After the Johnston hearing, Timothy Wirth, a freshman Democratic senator from Colorado on the energy committee, began to plan a comprehensive package of climate-change legislation -- a New Deal for global warming. Wirth asked a legislative assistant, David Harwood, to consult with experts on the issue, beginning with Rafe Pomerance, in the hope of converting the science of climate change into a new national energy policy.
  In March 1988, Wirth joined 41 other senators, nearly half of them Republicans, to demand that Reagan call for an international treaty modeled after the ozone agreement. Because the United States and the Soviet Union were the world's two largest contributors of carbon emissions, responsible for about one-third of the world total, they should lead the negotiations. Reagan agreed. In May, he signed a joint statement with Mikhail Gorbachev that included a pledge to cooperate on global warming.
  But a pledge didn't reduce emissions. Hansen was learning to think more strategically -- less like a scientist, more like a politician. Despite the efforts of Wirth, there was as yet no serious plan nationally or internationally to address climate change. Even Al Gore himself had, for the moment, withdrawn his political claim to the issue. In 1987, at the age of 39, Gore announced that he was running for president, in part to bring attention to global warming, but he stopped emphasizing it after the subject failed to captivate New Hampshire primary voters.
  Hansen told Pomerance that the biggest problem with the Johnston hearing, at least apart from the whole censorship business, had been the month in which it was held: November. ''This business of having global-warming hearings in such cool weather is never going to get attention,'' he said. He wasn't joking. At first he assumed that it was enough to publish studies about global warming and that the government would spring into action. Then he figured that his statements to Congress would do it. It had seemed, at least momentarily, that industry, understanding what was at stake, might lead. But nothing had worked.
  As spring turned to summer, Anniek Hansen noticed a change in her husband's disposition. He grew pale and unusually thin. When she asked him about his day, Hansen replied with some ambiguity and turned the conversation to sports: the Yankees, his daughter's basketball team, his son's baseball team. But even for him, he was unusually quiet, serious, distracted. Anniek would begin a conversation and find that he hadn't heard a word she said. She knew what he was thinking: He was running out of time. We were running out of time. Then came the summer of 1988, and Jim Hansen wasn't the only one who could tell that time was running out.
  5. 'You Will See Things That You Shall Believe' Summer 1988
  It was the hottest and driest summer in history. Everywhere you looked, something was bursting into flames. Two million acres in Alaska incinerated, and dozens of major fires scored the West. Yellowstone National Park lost nearly one million acres. Smoke was visible from Chicago, 1,600 miles away.
  In Nebraska, suffering its worst drought since the Dust Bowl, there were days when every weather station registered temperatures above 100 degrees. The director of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment warned that the drought might be the dawning of a climatic change that within a half century could turn the state into a desert. ''The dang heat,'' said a farmer in Grinnell. ''Farming has so many perils, but climate is 99 percent of it.'' In parts of Wisconsin, where Gov. Tommy Thompson banned fireworks and smoking cigarettes outdoors, the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers evaporated completely. ''At that point,'' said an official from the Department of Natural Resources, ''we must just sit back and watch the fish die.''
  Harvard University, for the first time, closed because of heat. New York City's streets melted, its mosquito population quadrupled and its murder rate reached a record high. ''It's a chore just to walk,'' a former hostage negotiator told a reporter. ''You want to be left alone.'' The 28th floor of Los Angeles's second-tallest building burst into flames; the cause, the Fire Department concluded, was spontaneous combustion. Ducks fled the continental United States in search of wetlands, many ending up in Alaska, swelling the pintail population there to 1.5 million from 100,000. ''How do you spell relief?'' asked a spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service. ''If you are a duck from America's parched prairies, this year you may spell it A-L-A-S-K-A.''
  Nineteen Miss Indiana contestants, outfitted with raincoats and umbrellas, sang ''Come Rain or Come Shine,'' but it did not rain. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a Democratic presidential candidate, stood in an Illinois cornfield and prayed for rain, but it did not rain. Cliff Doebel, the owner of a gardening store in Clyde, Ohio, paid $2,000 to import Leonard Crow Dog, a Sioux Indian medicine man from Rosebud, S.D. Crow Dog claimed to have performed 127 rain dances, all successful. ''You will see things that you shall believe,'' he told the townspeople of Clyde. ''You will feel there is a chance for us all.'' After three days of dancing, it rained less than a quarter of an inch.
  Texas farmers fed their cattle cactus. Stretches of the Mississippi River flowed at less than one-fifth of normal capacity. Roughly 1,700 barges beached at Greenville, Miss.; an additional 2,000 were marooned at St. Louis and Memphis. The on-field thermometer at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, where the Phillies were hosting the Chicago Cubs for a matinee, read 130 degrees. During a pitching change, every player, coach and umpire, save the catcher and the entering reliever, Todd Frohwirth, fled into the dugouts. (Frohwirth would earn the victory.) In the Cleveland suburb of Lakewood on June 21, yet another record-smasher, a roofer working with 600-degree tar exclaimed, ''Will this madness ever end?''
  On June 22 in Washington, where it hit 100 degrees, Rafe Pomerance received a call from Jim Hansen, who was scheduled to testify the following morning at a Senate hearing called by Timothy Wirth.
  ''I hope we have good media coverage tomorrow,'' Hansen said.
  This amused Pomerance. He was the one who tended to worry about press; Hansen usually claimed indifference to such vulgar considerations. ''Why's that?'' Pomerance asked.
  Hansen had just received the most recent global temperature data. Just over halfway into the year, 1988 was setting records. Already it had nearly clinched the hottest year in history. Ahead of schedule, the signal was emerging from the noise.
  ''I'm going to make a pretty strong statement,'' Hansen said.
  6. 'The Signal Has Emerged' June 1988
  The night before the hearing, Hansen flew to Washington to give himself enough time to prepare his oral testimony in his hotel room. But he couldn't focus -- the ballgame was on the radio. The slumping Yankees, who had fallen behind the Tigers for first place, were trying to avoid a sweep in Detroit, and the game went to extra innings. Hansen fell asleep without finishing his statement. He awoke to bright sunlight, high humidity, choking heat. It was signal weather in Washington: the hottest June 23 in history.
  Before going to the Capitol, he attended a meeting at NASA headquarters. One of his early champions at the agency, Ichtiaque Rasool, was announcing the creation of a new carbon-dioxide program. Hansen, sitting in a room with dozens of scientists, continued to scribble his testimony under the table, barely listening. But he heard Rasool say that the goal of the new program was to determine when a warming signal might emerge. As you all know, Rasool said, no respectable scientist would say that you already have a signal.
  Hansen interrupted.
  ''I don't know if he's respectable or not,'' he said, ''but I do know one scientist who is about to tell the U.S. Senate that the signal has emerged.''
  The other scientists looked up in surprise, but Rasool ignored Hansen and continued his presentation. Hansen returned to his testimony. He wrote: ''The global warming is now large enough that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause-and-effect relationship to the greenhouse effect.'' He wrote: ''1988 so far is so much warmer than 1987, that barring a remarkable and improbable cooling, 1988 will be the warmest year on record.'' He wrote: ''The greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now.''
  By 2:10 p.m., when the session began, it was 98 degrees, and not much cooler in Room 366 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, thanks to the two rows of television-camera lights. Timothy Wirth's office had told reporters that the plain-spoken NASA scientist was going to make a major statement. After the staff members saw the cameras, even those senators who hadn't planned to attend appeared at the dais, hastily reviewing the remarks their aides had drafted for them. Half an hour before the hearing, Wirth pulled Hansen aside. He wanted to change the order of speakers, placing Hansen first. The senator wanted to make sure that Hansen's statement got the proper amount of attention. Hansen agreed.
  ''We have only one planet,'' Senator Bennett Johnston intoned. ''If we screw it up, we have no place to go.'' Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat from Montana, called for the United Nations Environment Program to begin preparing a global remedy to the carbon-dioxide problem. Senator Dale Bumpers, a Democrat of Arkansas, previewed Hansen's testimony, saying that it ''ought to be cause for headlines in every newspaper in America tomorrow morning.'' The coverage, Bumpers emphasized, was a necessary precursor to policy. ''Nobody wants to take on any of the industries that produce the things that we throw up into the atmosphere,'' he said. ''But what you have are all these competing interests pitted against our very survival.''
  Wirth asked those standing in the gallery to claim the few remaining seats available. ''There is no point in standing up through this on a hot day,'' he said, happy for the occasion to emphasize the historical heat. Then he introduced the star witness.
  Hansen, wiping his brow, spoke without affect, his eyes rarely rising from his notes. The warming trend could be detected ''with 99 percent confidence,'' he said. ''It is changing our climate now.'' But he saved his strongest comment for after the hearing, when he was encircled in the hallway by reporters. ''It is time to stop waffling so much,'' he said, ''and say that the evidence is pretty strong that the greenhouse effect is here.''
  The press followed Bumpers's advice. Hansen's testimony prompted headlines in dozens of newspapers across the country, including The New York Times, which announced, across the top of its front page: ''Global Warming Has Begun, Expert Tells Senate.''
  But Hansen had no time to dwell on any of this. As soon as he got home to New York, Anniek told him she had breast cancer. She had found out two weeks earlier, but she didn't want to upset him before the hearing. In the following days, while the entire world tried to learn about James Hansen, he tried to learn about Anniek's illness. After he absorbed the initial shock and made a truce with the fear -- his grandmother died from the disease -- he dedicated himself to his wife's treatment with all the rigor of his profession. As they weighed treatment options and analyzed medical data, Anniek noticed him begin to change. The frustration of the last year began to fall away. It yielded, in those doctor's offices, to a steady coolness, an obsession for detail, a dogged optimism. He began to look like himself again.
  7. 'Woodstock For Climate Change' June 1988-April 1989
  In the immediate flush of optimism after the Wirth hearing -- henceforth known as the Hansen hearing -- Rafe Pomerance called his allies on Capitol Hill, the young staff members who advised politicians, organized hearings, wrote legislation. We need to finalize a number, he told them, a specific target, in order to move the issue -- to turn all this publicity into policy. The Montreal Protocol had called for a 50 percent reduction in CFC emissions by 1998. What was the right target for carbon emissions? It wasn't enough to exhort nations to do better. That kind of talk might sound noble, but it didn't change investments or laws. They needed a hard goal -- something ambitious but reasonable. And they needed it soon: Just four days after Hansen's star turn, politicians from 46 nations and more than 300 scientists would convene in Toronto at the World Conference on the Changing Atmosphere, an event described by Philip Shabecoff of The New York Times as ''Woodstock for climate change.''
  Pomerance hastily arranged a meeting with, among others, David Harwood, the architect of Wirth's climate legislation; Roger Dower in the Congressional Budget Office, who was calculating the plausibility of a national carbon tax; and Irving Mintzer, a colleague at the World Resources Institute who had a deep knowledge of energy economics. Wirth was scheduled to give the keynote address at Toronto -- Harwood would write it -- and could propose a number then. But which one?
  Pomerance had a proposal: a 20 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2000.
  Ambitious, Harwood said. In all his work planning climate policy, he had seen no assurance that such a steep drop in emissions was possible. Then again, 2000 was more than a decade off, so it allowed for some flexibility.
  What really mattered wasn't the number itself, Dower said, but simply that they settle on one. He agreed that a hard target was the only way to push the issue forward. Though his job at the C.B.O. required him to come up with precise estimates of speculative, complex policy, there wasn't time for yet another academic study to arrive at the exact right number. Pomerance's unscientific suggestion sounded fine to him.
  Mintzer pointed out that a 20 percent reduction was consistent with the academic literature on energy efficiency. Various studies over the years had shown that you could improve efficiency in most energy systems by roughly 20 percent if you adopted best practices. Of course, with any target, you had to take into account the fact that the developing world would inevitably consume much larger quantities of fossil fuels by 2000. But those gains could be offset by a wider propagation of the renewable technologies already at hand -- solar, wind, geothermal. It was not a rigorous scientific analysis, Mintzer granted, but 20 percent sounded plausible. We wouldn't need to solve cold fusion or ask Congress to repeal the law of gravity. We could manage it with the knowledge and technology we already had.
  Besides, Pomerance said, 20 by 2000 sounds good.
  In Toronto a few days later, Pomerance talked up his idea with everyone he met -- environmental ministers, scientists, journalists. Nobody thought it sounded crazy. He took that as an encouraging sign. Other delegates soon proposed the number to him independently, as if they had come up with it themselves. That was an even better sign.
  Wirth, in his keynote on June 27, called for the world to reduce emissions by 20 percent by 2000, with an eventual reduction of 50 percent. Other speakers likened the ramifications of climate change to a global nuclear war, but it was the emissions target that was heard in Washington, London, Berlin, Moscow. The conference's final statement, signed by all 400 scientists and politicians in attendance, repeated the demand with a slight variation: a 20 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2005. Just like that, Pomerance's best guess became global diplomatic policy.
  Hansen, emerging from Anniek's successful cancer surgery, took it upon himself to start a one-man public information campaign. He gave news conferences and was quoted in seemingly every article about the issue; he even appeared on television with homemade props. Like an entrant at an elementary-school science fair, he made ''loaded dice'' out of sections of cardboard and colored paper to illustrate the increased likelihood of hotter weather in a warmer climate. Public awareness of the greenhouse effect reached a new high of 68 percent.
  At the end of the sulfurous summer, several months after Gore ended his candidacy, global warming became a major subject of the presidential campaign. While Michael Dukakis proposed tax incentives to encourage domestic oil production and boasted that coal could satisfy the nation's energy needs for the next three centuries, George Bush took advantage. ''I am an environmentalist,'' he declared on the shore of Lake Erie, the first stop on a five-state environmental tour that would take him to Boston Harbor, Dukakis's home turf. ''Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect,'' he said, ''are forgetting about the White House effect.'' His running mate emphasized the ticket's commitment to the issue at the vice-presidential debate. ''The greenhouse effect is an important environmental issue,'' Dan Quayle said. ''We need to get on with it. And in a George Bush administration, you can bet that we will.''
  This kind of talk roused the oil-and-gas men. ''A lot of people on the Hill see the greenhouse effect as the issue of the 1990s,'' a gas lobbyist told Oil & Gas Journal. Before a meeting of oil executives shortly after the ''environmentalist'' candidate won the election, Representative Dick Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, warned, ''It's going to be very difficult to fend off some kind of gasoline tax.'' The coal industry, which had the most to lose from restrictions on carbon emissions, had moved beyond denial to resignation. A spokesman for the National Coal Association acknowledged that the greenhouse effect was no longer ''an emerging issue. It is here already, and we'll be hearing more and more about it.''
  By the end of the year, 32 climate bills had been introduced in Congress, led by Wirth's omnibus National Energy Policy Act of 1988. Co-sponsored by 13 Democrats and five Republicans, it established as a national goal an ''International Global Agreement on the Atmosphere by 1992,'' ordered the Energy Department to submit to Congress a plan to reduce energy use by at least 2 percent a year through 2005 and directed the Congressional Budget Office to calculate the feasibility of a carbon tax. A lawyer for the Senate energy committee told an industry journal that lawmakers were ''frightened'' by the issue and predicted that Congress would eventually pass significant legislation after Bush took office.
  The other great powers refused to wait. The German Parliament created a special commission on climate change, which concluded that action had to be taken immediately, ''irrespective of any need for further research,'' and that the Toronto goal was inadequate; it recommended a 30 percent reduction of carbon emissions. The prime ministers of Canada and Norway called for a binding international treaty on the atmosphere; Sweden's Parliament went further, announcing a national strategy to stabilize emissions at the 1988 level and eventually imposing a carbon tax; and Margaret Thatcher, who had studied chemistry at Oxford, warned in a speech to the Royal Society that global warming could ''greatly exceed the capacity of our natural habitat to cope'' and that ''the health of the economy and the health of our environment are totally dependent upon each other.''
  It was at this time -- at a moment when the environmental movement was, in the words of one energy lobbyist, ''on a tear'' -- that the United Nations unanimously endorsed the establishment, by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program, of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientists and policymakers, to conduct scientific assessments and develop global climate policy. One of the I.P.C.C.'s first sessions to plan an international treaty was hosted by the State Department, 10 days after Bush's inauguration. James Baker chose the occasion to make his first speech as secretary of state. ''We can probably not afford to wait until all of the uncertainties about global climate change have been resolved,'' he said. ''Time will not make the problem go away.'' Much of Congress agreed: On April 14, 1989, a bipartisan group of 24 senators, led by the majority leader, George Mitchell, requested that Bush cut emissions in the United States even before the I.P.C.C.'s working group made its recommendation. ''We cannot afford the long lead times associated with a comprehensive global agreement,'' the senators wrote. Bush had promised to combat the greenhouse effect with the White House effect. The self-proclaimed environmentalist was now seated in the Oval Office. It was time.
  8. 'You Never Beat The White House' April 1989
  After Jim Baker gave his boisterous address to the I.P.C.C. working group at the State Department, he received a visit from John Sununu, Bush's chief of staff. Leave the science to the scientists, Sununu told Baker. Stay clear of this greenhouse-effect nonsense. You don't know what you're talking about.
  Baker, who had served as Reagan's chief of staff, didn't speak about the subject again. He later told the White House that he was recusing himself from energy-policy issues, on account of his previous career as a Houston oil-and-gas lawyer.
  Sununu, an enthusiastic contrarian, delighted in defying any lazy characterizations of himself. His father was a Lebanese exporter from Boston, and his mother was a Salvadoran of Greek ancestry; he was born in Havana. In his three terms as governor of New Hampshire, he had come, in the epithets of national political columnists, to embody Yankee conservatism: pragmatic, business-friendly, technocratic, ''no-nonsense.'' He had fought angrily against local environmentalists to open a nuclear power plant, but he had also signed the nation's first acid-rain legislation and lobbied Reagan directly for a reduction of sulfur-dioxide pollution by 50 percent, the target sought by the Audubon Society. He was perceived as more conservative than the president, a budget hawk who had turned a $44 million state deficit into a surplus without raising taxes, and openly insulted Republican politicians and the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce when they drifted, however tentatively, from his anti-tax doctrinairism. Yet he increased spending on mental health care and public-land preservation in New Hampshire, and in the White House he would help negotiate a tax increase and secure the Supreme Court nomination of David Souter.
  Bush had chosen Sununu for his political instincts -- he was credited with having won Bush the New Hampshire primary, after Bush came in third in Iowa, all but securing him the nomination. But despite his reputation as a political wolf, he still thought of himself as a scientist -- an ''old engineer,'' as he was fond of putting it, having earned a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from M.I.T. decades earlier. He lacked the reflexive deference that so many of his political generation reserved for the class of elite government scientists. Since World War II, he believed, conspiratorial forces had used the imprimatur of scientific knowledge to advance an ''anti-growth'' doctrine. He reserved particular disdain for Paul Ehrlich's ''The Population Bomb,'' which prophesied that hundreds of millions of people would starve to death if the world took no step to curb population growth; the Club of Rome, an organization of European scientists, heads of state and economists, which similarly warned that the world would run out of natural resources; and as recently as the mid-'70s, the hypothesis advanced by some of the nation's most celebrated scientists -- including Carl Sagan, Stephen Schneider and Ichtiaque Rasool -- that a new ice age was dawning, thanks to the proliferation of man-made aerosols. All were theories of questionable scientific merit, portending vast, authoritarian remedies to halt economic progress.
  Sununu had suspected that the greenhouse effect belonged to this nefarious cabal since 1975, when the anthropologist Margaret Mead convened a symposium on the subject at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. ''Unless the peoples of the world can begin to understand the immense and long-term consequences of what appear to be small immediate choices,'' Mead wrote, ''the whole planet may become endangered.'' Her conclusions were stark, immediate and absent the caveats that hobbled the scientific literature. Or as Sununu saw it, she showed her hand: ''Never before have the governing bodies of the world been faced with decisions so far-reaching,'' Mead wrote. ''It is inevitable that there will be a clash between those concerned with immediate problems and those who concern themselves with long-term consequences.'' When Mead talked about ''far-reaching'' decisions and ''long-term consequences,'' Sununu heard the marching of jackboots.
  In April, the director of the O.M.B., Richard Darman, a close ally of Sununu's, mentioned that the NASA scientist James Hansen, who had forced the issue of global warming onto the national agenda the previous summer, was going to testify again -- this time at a hearing called by Al Gore. Darman had the testimony and described it. Sununu was appalled: Hansen's language seemed extreme, based on scientific arguments that he considered, as he later put it, like ''technical garbage.''
  While Sununu and Darman reviewed Hansen's statements, the E.P.A. administrator, William K. Reilly, took a new proposal to the White House. The next meeting of the I.P.C.C.'s working group was scheduled for Geneva the following month, in May; it was the perfect occasion, Reilly argued, to take a stronger stand on climate change. Bush should demand a global treaty to reduce carbon emissions.
  Sununu disagreed. It would be foolish, he said, to let the nation stumble into a binding agreement on questionable scientific merits, especially as it would compel some unknown quantity of economic pain. They went back and forth. Reilly didn't want to cede leadership on the issue to the European powers; after all, the first high-level diplomatic meeting on climate change, to which Reilly was invited, would take place just a few months later in the Netherlands. Statements of caution would make the ''environmental president'' look like a hypocrite and hurt the United States' leverage in a negotiation. But Sununu wouldn't budge. He ordered the American delegates not to make any commitment in Geneva. Very soon after that, someone leaked the exchange to the press.
  Sununu, blaming Reilly, was furious. When accounts of his argument with Reilly appeared in The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post ahead of the Geneva I.P.C.C. meeting, they made the White House look as if it didn't know what it was doing.
  A deputy of Jim Baker pulled Reilly aside. He said he had a message from Baker, who had observed Reilly's infighting with Sununu. ''In the long run,'' the deputy warned Reilly, ''you never beat the White House.''
  9. 'A Form of Science Fraud' May 1989
  In the first week of May 1989, when Hansen received his proposed testimony back from the O.M.B., it was disfigured by deletions and, more incredible, additions. Gore had called the hearing to increase the pressure on Bush to sign major climate legislation; Hansen had wanted to use the occasion to clarify one major point that, in the hubbub following the 1988 hearing, had been misunderstood. Global warming would not only cause more heat waves and droughts like those of the previous summer but would also lead to more extreme rain events. This was crucial -- he didn't want the public to conclude, the next time there was a mild summer, that global warming wasn't real.
  But the edited text was a mess. For a couple of days, Hansen played along, accepting the more innocuous edits. But he couldn't accept some of the howlers proposed by the O.M.B. With the hearing only two days away, he gave up. He told NASA's congressional liaison to stop fighting. Let the White House have its way, he said.
  But Hansen would have his way, too. As soon as he hung up, he drafted a letter to Gore. He explained that the O.M.B. wanted him to demote his own scientific findings to ''estimates'' from models that were ''evolving'' and unreliable. His anonymous censor wanted him to say that the causes of global warming were ''scientifically unknown'' and might be attributable to ''natural processes,'' caveats that would not only render his testimony meaningless but make him sound like a moron. The most bizarre addition, however, was a statement of a different kind. He was asked to argue that Congress should only pass climate legislation that immediately benefited the economy, ''independent of concerns about an increasing greenhouse effect'' -- a sentence that no scientist would ever utter, unless perhaps he were employed by the American Petroleum Institute. Hansen faxed his letter to Gore and left the office.
  When he arrived home, Anniek told him Gore had called. Would it be all right, Gore asked when Hansen spoke with him, if I tell a couple of reporters about this?
  The New York Times's Philip Shabecoff called the next morning. ''I should be allowed to say what is my scientific position,'' Hansen told him. ''I can understand changing policy, but not science.''
  On Monday, May 8, the morning of the hearing, he left early for his flight to Washington and did not see the newspaper until he arrived at Dirksen, where Gore showed it to him. The front-page headline read: ''Scientist Says Budget Office Altered His Testimony.'' They agreed that Hansen would give his testimony as planned, after which Gore would ask about the passages that the O.M.B. had rewritten.
  Gore stopped at the door. ''We better go separately,'' he said. ''Otherwise they'll be able to get both of us with one hand grenade.''
  In the crowded hearing room, the cameras fixed on Hansen. He held his statement in one hand and a single Christmas tree bulb in the other -- a prop to help explain, however shakily, that the warming already created by fossil-fuel combustion was equivalent to placing a Christmas light over every square meter of Earth's surface. After Hansen read his sanitized testimony, Gore pounced. He was puzzled by inconsistencies in the distinguished scientist's presentation, he said in a tone thick with mock confusion. ''Why do you directly contradict yourself?''
  Hansen explained that he had not written those contradictory statements. ''The Bush administration is acting as if it is scared of the truth,'' Gore said. ''If they forced you to change a scientific conclusion, it is a form of science fraud.''
  Another government scientist testifying at the hearing, Jerry Mahlman from NOAA, acknowledged that the White House had previously tried to change his conclusions too. Mahlman had managed to deflect the worst of it, however -- ''objectionable and also unscientific'' recommendations, he said, that would have been ''severely embarrassing to me in the face of my scientific colleagues.''
  Gore called it ''an outrage of the first order of magnitude.'' The 1988 hearing had created a hero out of Jim Hansen. Now Gore had a real villain, one far more treacherous than Fred Koomanoff -- a nameless censor in the White House, hiding behind O.M.B. letterhead.
  The cameras followed Hansen and Gore into the marbled hallway. Hansen insisted that he wanted to focus on the science. Gore focused on the politics. ''I think they're scared of the truth,'' he said. ''They're scared that Hansen and the other scientists are right and that some dramatic policy changes are going to be needed, and they don't want to face up to it.''
  10. The White House Effect Fall 1989
  The censorship did more to publicize Hansen's testimony and the dangers of global warming than anything he could have possibly said. At the White House briefing later that morning, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater admitted that Hansen's statement had been changed. He blamed an official ''five levels down from the top'' and promised that there would be no retaliation. Hansen, he added, was ''an outstanding and distinguished scientist'' and was ''doing a great job.''
  The Los Angeles Times called the censorship ''an outrageous assault.'' The Chicago Tribune said it was the beginning of ''a cold war on global warming,'' and The New York Times warned that the White House's ''heavy-handed intervention sends the signal that Washington wants to go slow on addressing the greenhouse problem.''
  The day after the hearing, Gore received an unannounced visit from the O.M.B. director, Richard Darman. He came alone, without aides. He said he wanted to apologize to Gore in person. He was sorry, and he wanted Gore to know it; the O.M.B. would not try to censor anyone again. Gore, stunned, thanked Darman. Something about his apology -- the effusiveness, the mortified tone or perhaps the fact that he had come by himself, as if in secret -- left Gore with the impression that the idea to censor Hansen didn't come from someone five levels down from the top, or even below Darman. It had come from someone above Darman.
  Darman went to see Sununu. He didn't like being accused of censoring scientists. They needed to issue some kind of response. Sununu called Reilly to ask if he had any ideas. We could start, Reilly said, by recommitting to a global climate treaty. The United States was the only Western nation on record as opposing negotiations.
  Sununu sent a telegram to Geneva endorsing a plan ''to develop full international consensus on necessary steps to prepare for a formal treaty-negotiating process. The scope and importance of this issue are so great that it is essential for the U.S. to exercise leadership.'' He proposed an international workshop to improve the accuracy of the science and calculate the economic costs of emissions reductions. Sununu signed the telegram himself. A day later, the president pledged to host a climate workshop at the White House. Rafe Pomerance was unconvinced, telling the press that this belated effort to save face was a ''waffle'' that fell short of real action: ''We should be able to complete a treaty by the end of 1990,'' he said, ''not be starting one.'' But the general response from the press was relief and praise.
  Still, Sununu seethed at any mention of the subject. He had taken it upon himself to study more deeply the greenhouse effect; he would have a rudimentary, one-dimensional general circulation model installed on his personal desktop computer. He decided that the models promoted by Jim Hansen were a lot of bunk. They were horribly imprecise in scale and underestimated the ocean's ability to mitigate warming. Sununu complained about Hansen to D. Allan Bromley, a nuclear physicist from Yale who, at Sununu's recommendation, was named Bush's science adviser. Hansen's findings were ''technical poppycock'' that didn't begin to justify such wild-eyed pronouncements that ''the greenhouse effect is here'' or that the 1988 heat waves could be attributed to global warming, let alone serve as the basis for national economic policy.
  When a junior staff member in the Energy Department, in a meeting at the White House with Sununu and Reilly, mentioned an initiative to reduce fossil-fuel use, Sununu interrupted her. ''Why in the world would you need to reduce fossil-fuel use?'' he asked. ''Because of climate change,'' the young woman replied.
  ''I don't want anyone in this administration without a scientific background using 'climate change' or 'global warming' ever again,'' he said. ''If you don't have a technical basis for policy, don't run around making decisions on the basis of newspaper headlines.'' After the meeting, Reilly caught up to the staff member in the hallway. She was shaken. Don't take it personally, Reilly told her. Sununu might have been looking at you, but that was directed at me.
  Relations between Sununu and Reilly became openly adversarial. Reilly, Sununu thought, was a creature of the environmental lobby. He was trying to impress his friends at the E.P.A. without having a basic grasp of the science himself. Most unforgivable of all was what Sununu saw as Reilly's propensity to leak to the press. Whenever Reilly sent the White House names of candidates he wanted to hire for openings at the E.P.A., Sununu vetoed them. When it came time for the high-level diplomatic meeting in November, a gathering of environmental ministers in the Netherlands, Sununu didn't trust Reilly to negotiate on behalf of the White House. So he sent Allan Bromley to accompany him.
  Reilly, for his part, didn't entirely blame Sununu for Bush's indecision on the prospect of a climate treaty. The president had never taken a vigorous interest in global warming and was mainly briefed about it by nonscientists. Bush had brought up the subject on the campaign trail, in his speech about the White House effect, after leafing through a briefing booklet for a new issue that might generate some positive press. When Reilly tried in person to persuade him to take action, Bush deferred to Sununu and Baker. Why don't the three of you work it out, he said. Let me know when you decide. But by the time Reilly got to the Noordwijk Ministerial Conference in the Netherlands, he suspected that it was already too late.
  11. 'The Skunks at The Garden Party' November 1989
  Rafe Pomerance awoke at sunlight and stole out of his hotel, making for the flagpoles. It was nearly freezing -- Nov. 6, 1989, on the coast of the North Sea in the Dutch resort town of Noordwijk -- but the wind had yet to rise and the photographer was waiting. More than 60 flags lined the strand between the hotel and the beach, one for each nation in attendance at the first major diplomatic meeting on global warming. The delegations would review the progress made by the I.P.C.C. and decide whether to endorse a framework for a global treaty. There was a general sense among the delegates that they would, at minimum, agree to the target proposed by the host, the Dutch environmental minister, more modest than the Toronto number: a freezing of greenhouse-gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. Some believed that if the meeting was a success, it would encourage the I.P.C.C. to accelerate its negotiations and reach a decision about a treaty sooner. But at the very least, the world's environmental ministers should sign a statement endorsing a hard, binding target of emissions reductions. The mood among the delegates was electric, nearly giddy -- after more than a decade of fruitless international meetings, they could finally sign an agreement that meant something.
  Pomerance had not been among the 400 delegates invited to Noordwijk. But together with three young activists -- Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club, Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists and Stewart Boyle from Friends of the Earth -- he had formed his own impromptu delegation. Their constituency, they liked to say, was the climate itself. Their mission was to pressure the delegates to include in the final conference statement, which would be used as the basis for a global treaty, the target proposed in Toronto: a 20 percent reduction of greenhouse-gas combustion by 2005. It was the only measure that mattered, the amount of emissions reductions, and the Toronto number was the strongest global target yet proposed.
  The activists booked their own travel and doubled up in rooms at a beat-up motel down the beach. They managed to secure all-access credentials from the Dutch environmental ministry's press secretary. He was inclined to be sympathetic toward the activists because it had been rumored that Allan Bromley, one of the United States' lead delegates, would try to persuade the delegates from Japan and the Soviet Union to join him in resisting the idea of a binding agreement, despite the fact that Bush had again claimed just earlier that week that the United States would ''play a leadership role in global warming.'' The Dutch were especially concerned about this development, as even a minor rise in sea level would swamp much of their nation.
  The activists planned to stage a stunt each day to embarrass Bromley and galvanize support for a hard treaty. The first took place at the flagpoles, where they met a photographer from Agence France-Presse at dawn. Performing for the photographer, Boyle and Becker lowered the Japanese, Soviet and American flags to half-staff. Becker gave a reporter an outraged statement, accusing the three nations of conspiring to block the one action necessary to save the planet. The article appeared on front pages across Europe.
  On the second day, Pomerance and Becker met an official from Kiribati, an island nation of 33 atolls in the middle of the Pacific Ocean about halfway between Hawaii and Australia. They asked if he was Kiribati's environmental minister.
  Kiribati is a very small place, the man said. I do everything. I'm the environmental minister. I'm the science minister. I'm everything. If the sea rises, he said, my entire nation will be underwater.
  Pomerance and Becker exchanged a look. ''If we set up a news conference,'' Pomerance asked, ''will you tell them what you just told us?''
  Within minutes, they had assembled a couple dozen journalists.
  There is no place on Kiribati taller than my head, began the minister, who seemed barely more than five feet tall. So when we talk about one-foot sea-level rise, that means the water is up to my shin.
  He pointed to his shin.
  Two feet, he said, that's my thigh.
  He pointed to his thigh.
  Three feet, that's my waist.
  He pointed to his waist.
  Am I making myself clear?
  Pomerance and Becker were ecstatic. The minister came over to them. Is that what you had in mind? he asked.
  It was a good start, and necessary too -- Pomerance had the sinking feeling that the momentum of the previous year was beginning to flag. The censoring of Hansen's testimony and the inexplicably strident opposition from John Sununu were ominous signs. So were the findings of a report Pomerance had commissioned, published in September by the World Resources Institute, tracking global greenhouse-gas emissions. The United States was the largest contributor by far, producing nearly a quarter of the world's carbon emissions, and its contribution was growing faster than that of every other country. Bush's indecision, or perhaps inattention, had already managed to delay the negotiation of a global climate treaty until 1990 at the earliest, perhaps even 1991. By then, Pomerance worried, it would be too late.
  The one meeting to which Pomerance's atmospheric delegation could not gain admittance was the only one that mattered: the final negotiation. The scientists and I.P.C.C. staff members were asked to leave; just the environmental ministers remained. Pomerance and the other activists haunted the carpeted hallway outside the conference room, waiting and thinking. A decade earlier, Pomerance helped warn the White House of the dangers posed by fossil-fuel combustion; nine years earlier, at a fairy-tale castle on the Gulf of Mexico, he tried to persuade Congress to write climate legislation, reshape American energy policy and demand that the United States lead an international process to arrest climate change. Just one year ago, he devised the first emissions target to be proposed at a major international conference. Now, at the end of the decade, senior diplomats from all over the world were debating the merits of a binding climate treaty. Only he was powerless to participate. He could only trust, as he stared at the wall separating him from the diplomats and their muffled debate, that all his work had been enough.
  The meeting began in the morning and continued into the night, much longer than expected; most of the delegates had come to the conference ready to sign the Dutch proposal. Each time the doors opened and a minister headed to the bathroom at the other end of the hall, the activists leapt up, asking for an update. The ministers maintained a studied silence, but as the negotiations went past midnight, their aggravation was recorded in their stricken faces and opened collars.
  ''What's happening?'' Becker shouted, for the hundredth time, as the Swedish minister surfaced.
  ''Your government,'' the minister said, ''is fucking this thing up!''
  When the beaten delegates finally emerged from the conference room, Becker and Pomerance learned what happened. Bromley, at the urging of John Sununu and with the acquiescence of Britain, Japan and the Soviet Union, had forced the conference to abandon the commitment to freeze emissions. The final statement noted only that ''many'' nations supported stabilizing emissions -- but did not indicate which nations or at what emissions level. And with that, a decade of excruciating, painful, exhilarating progress turned to air.
  The environmentalists spent the morning giving interviews and writing news releases. ''You must conclude the conference is a failure,'' Becker said, calling the dissenting nations ''the skunks at the garden party.'' Greenpeace called it a ''disaster.'' Timothy Wirth, in Washington, said the outcome was proof that the United States was ''not a leader but a delinquent partner.''
  Pomerance tried to be more diplomatic. ''The president made a commitment to the American people to deal with global warming,'' he told The Washington Post, ''and he hasn't followed it up.'' He didn't want to sound defeated. ''There are some good building blocks here,'' Pomerance said, and he meant it. The Montreal Protocol on CFCs wasn't perfect at first, either -- it had huge loopholes and weak restrictions. Once in place, however, the restrictions could be tightened. Perhaps the same could happen with climate change. Perhaps. Pomerance was not one for pessimism. As William Reilly told reporters, dutifully defending the official position forced upon him, it was the first time that the United States had formally endorsed the concept of an emissions limit. Pomerance wanted to believe that this was progress.
  Before leaving the Netherlands, he joined the other activists for a final round of drinks and commiseration. He would have to return to Washington the next day and start all over again. The I.P.C.C.'s next policy-group meeting would take place in Edinburgh in two months, and there was concern that the Noordwijk failure might influence the group members into lowering their expectations for a treaty. But Pomerance refused to be dejected -- there was no point to it. His companions, though more openly disappointed, shared his determination. One of them, Daniel Becker, had just found out that his wife was pregnant with their first child.
  She had traveled with Becker to the Netherlands to visit friends before the conference started. One day, their hosts took them on a day trip to Zeeland, a southwestern province where three rivers emptied into the sea. All week in Noordwijk, Becker couldn't stop talking about what he had seen in Zeeland. After a flood in 1953, when the sea swallowed much of the region, killing more than 2,000 people, the Dutch began to build the Delta Works, a vast concrete-and-steel fortress of movable barriers, dams and sluice gates -- a masterpiece of human engineering. The whole system could be locked into place within 90 minutes, defending the land against storm surge. It reduced the country's exposure to the sea by 700 kilometers, Becker explained. The United States coastline was about 153,000 kilometers long. How long, he asked, was the entire terrestrial coastline? Because the whole world was going to need this. In Zeeland, he said, he had seen the future.
  Epilogue
  Ken Caldeira, a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, Calif., has a habit of asking new graduate students to name the largest fundamental breakthrough in climate physics since 1979. It's a trick question. There has been no breakthrough. As with any mature scientific discipline, there is only refinement. The computer models grow more precise; the regional analyses sharpen; estimates solidify into observational data. Where there have been inaccuracies, they have tended to be in the direction of understatement. Caldeira and a colleague recently published a paper in Nature finding that the world is warming more quickly than most climate models predict. The toughest emissions reductions now being proposed, even by the most committed nations, will probably fail to achieve ''any given global temperature stabilization target.''
  More carbon has been released into the atmosphere since the final day of the Noordwijk conference, Nov. 7, 1989, than in the entire history of civilization preceding it. In 1990, humankind burned more than 20 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. By 2017, the figure had risen to 32.5 billion metric tons, a record. Despite every action taken since the Charney report -- the billions of dollars invested in research, the nonbinding treaties, the investments in renewable energy -- the only number that counts, the total quantity of global greenhouse gas emitted per year, has continued its inexorable rise.
  Like the scientific story, the political story hasn't changed greatly, except in its particulars. Even some of the nations that pushed hardest for climate policy have failed to honor their own commitments. When it comes to our own nation, which has failed to make any binding commitments whatsoever, the dominant narrative for the last quarter century has concerned the efforts of the fossil-fuel industries to suppress science, confuse public knowledge and bribe politicians.
  The mustache-twirling depravity of these campaigns has left the impression that the oil-and-gas industry always operated thus; while the Exxon scientists and American Petroleum Institute clerics of the '70s and '80s were hardly good Samaritans, they did not start multimillion-dollar disinformation campaigns, pay scientists to distort the truth or try to brainwash children in elementary schools, as their successors would. It was James Hansen's testimony before Congress in 1988 that, for the first time since the ''Changing Climate'' report, made oil-and-gas executives begin to consider the issue's potential to hurt their profits. Exxon, as ever, led the field. Six weeks after Hansen's testimony, Exxon's manager of science and strategy development, Duane LeVine, prepared an internal strategy paper urging the company to ''emphasize the uncertainty in scientific conclusions.'' This shortly became the default position of the entire sector. LeVine, it so happened, served as chairman of the global petroleum industry's Working Group on Global Climate Change, created the same year, which adopted Exxon's position as its own.
  The American Petroleum Institute, after holding a series of internal briefings on the subject in the fall and winter of 1988, including one for the chief executives of the dozen or so largest oil companies, took a similar, if slightly more diplomatic, line. It set aside money for carbon-dioxide policy -- about $100,000, a fraction of the millions it was spending on the health effects of benzene, but enough to establish a lobbying organization called, in an admirable flourish of newspeak, the Global Climate Coalition. It was joined by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 14 other trade associations, including those representing the coal, electric-grid and automobile industries. The G.C.C. was conceived as a reactive body, to share news of any proposed regulations, but on a whim, it added a press campaign, to be coordinated mainly by the A.P.I. It gave briefings to politicians known to be friendly to the industry and approached scientists who professed skepticism about global warming. The A.P.I.'s payment for an original op-ed was $2,000.
  The chance to enact meaningful measures to prevent climate change was vanishing, but the industry had just begun. In October 1989, scientists allied with the G.C.C. began to be quoted in national publications, giving an issue that lacked controversy a convenient fulcrum. ''Many respected scientists say the available evidence doesn't warrant the doomsday warnings,'' was the caveat that began to appear in articles on climate change.
  Cheap and useful, G.C.C.-like groups started to proliferate, but it was not until international negotiations in preparation for the 1992 Rio Earth Summit began that investments in persuasion peddling rose to the level of a line item. At Rio, George H.W. Bush refused to commit to specific emissions reductions. The following year, when President Bill Clinton proposed an energy tax in the hope of meeting the goals of the Rio treaty, the A.P.I. invested $1.8 million in a G.C.C. disinformation campaign. Senate Democrats from oil-and-coal states joined Republicans to defeat the tax proposal, which later contributed to the Republicans' rout of Democrats in the midterm congressional elections in 1994 -- the first time the Republican Party had won control of both houses in 40 years. The G.C.C. spent $13 million on a single ad campaign intended to weaken support for the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which committed its parties to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 5 percent relative to 1990 levels. The Senate, which would have had to ratify the agreement, took a pre-emptive vote declaring its opposition; the resolution passed 95-0. There has never been another serious effort to negotiate a binding global climate treaty.
  The G.C.C. disbanded in 2002 after the defection of various members who were embarrassed by its tactics. But Exxon (now Exxon Mobil) continued its disinformation campaign for another half decade. This has made the corporation an especially vulnerable target for the wave of compensatory litigation that began in earnest in the last three years and may last a generation. Tort lawsuits have become possible only in recent years, as scientists have begun more precisely to attribute regional effects to global emission levels. This is one subfield of climate science that has advanced significantly since 1979 -- the assignment of blame.
  A major lawsuit has targeted the federal government. A consortium of 21 American children and young adults -- one of whom, Sophie Kivlehan of Allentown, Pa., is Jim Hansen's granddaughter -- claims that the government, by ''creating a national energy system that causes climate change,'' has violated its duty to protect the natural resources to which all Americans are entitled.
  In 2015, after reports by the website InsideClimate News and The Los Angeles Times documented the climate studies performed by Exxon for decades, the attorneys general of Massachusetts and New York began fraud investigations. The Securities and Exchange Commission separately started to investigate whether Exxon Mobil's valuation depended on the burning of all its known oil-and-gas reserves. (Exxon Mobil has denied any wrongdoing and stands by its valuation method.)
  The rallying cry of this multipronged legal effort is ''Exxon Knew.'' It is incontrovertibly true that senior employees at the company that would later become Exxon, like those at most other major oil-and-gas corporations, knew about the dangers of climate change as early as the 1950s. But the automobile industry knew, too, and began conducting its own research by the early 1980s, as did the major trade groups representing the electrical grid. They all own responsibility for our current paralysis and have made it more painful than necessary. But they haven't done it alone.
  The United States government knew. Roger Revelle began serving as a Kennedy administration adviser in 1961, five years after establishing the Mauna Loa carbon-dioxide program, and every president since has debated the merits of acting on climate policy. Carter had the Charney report, Reagan had ''Changing Climate'' and Bush had the censored testimony of James Hansen and his own public vow to solve the problem. Congress has been holding hearings for 40 years; the intelligence community has been tracking the crisis even longer.
  Everybody knew. In 1958, on prime-time television, ''The Bell Science Hour'' -- one of the most popular educational film series in American history -- aired ''The Unchained Goddess,'' a film about meteorological wonders, produced by Frank Capra, a dozen years removed from ''It's a Wonderful Life,'' warning that ''man may be unwittingly changing the world's climate'' through the release of carbon dioxide. ''A few degrees' rise in the Earth's temperature would melt the polar ice caps,'' says the film's kindly host, the bespectacled Dr. Research. ''An inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley. Tourists in glass-bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami through 150 feet of tropical water.'' Capra's film was shown in science classes for decades.
  Everyone knew -- and we all still know. We know that the transformations of our planet, which will come gradually and suddenly, will reconfigure the political world order. We know that if we don't act to reduce emissions, we risk the collapse of civilization. We also know that, without a gargantuan intervention, whatever happens will be worse for our children, worse yet for their children and even worse still for their children's children, whose lives, our actions have demonstrated, mean nothing to us.
  Could it have been any other way? In the late 1970s, a small group of philosophers, economists and political scientists began to debate, largely among themselves, whether a human solution to this human problem was even possible. They did not trouble themselves about the details of warming, taking the worst-case scenario as a given. They asked instead whether humankind, when presented with this particular existential crisis, was willing to prevent it. We worry about the future. But how much, exactly?
  The answer, as any economist could tell you, is very little. Economics, the science of assigning value to human behavior, prices the future at a discount; the farther out you project, the cheaper the consequences. This makes the climate problem the perfect economic disaster. The Yale economist William D. Nordhaus, a member of Jimmy Carter's Council of Economic Advisers, argued in the 1970s that the most appropriate remedy was a global carbon tax. But that required an international agreement, which Nordhaus didn't think was likely. Michael Glantz, a political scientist who was at the National Center for Atmospheric Research at the time, argued in 1979 that democratic societies are constitutionally incapable of dealing with the climate problem. The competition for resources means that no single crisis can ever command the public interest for long, yet climate change requires sustained, disciplined efforts over decades. And the German physicist-philosopher Klaus Meyer-Abich argued that any global agreement would inevitably favor the most minimal action. Adaptation, Meyer-Abich concluded, ''seems to be the most rational political option.'' It is the option that we have pursued, consciously or not, ever since.
  These theories share a common principle: that human beings, whether in global organizations, democracies, industries, political parties or as individuals, are incapable of sacrificing present convenience to forestall a penalty imposed on future generations. When I asked John Sununu about his part in this history -- whether he considered himself personally responsible for killing the best chance at an effective global-warming treaty -- his response echoed Meyer-Abich. ''It couldn't have happened,'' he told me, ''because, frankly, the leaders in the world at that time were at a stage where they were all looking how to seem like they were supporting the policy without having to make hard commitments that would cost their nations serious resources.'' He added, ''Frankly, that's about where we are today.''
  If human beings really were able to take the long view -- to consider seriously the fate of civilization decades or centuries after our deaths -- we would be forced to grapple with the transience of all we know and love in the great sweep of time. So we have trained ourselves, whether culturally or evolutionarily, to obsess over the present, worry about the medium term and cast the long term out of our minds, as we might spit out a poison.
  Like most human questions, the carbon-dioxide question will come down to fear. At some point, the fears of young people will overwhelm the fears of the old. Some time after that, the young will amass enough power to act. It will be too late to avoid some catastrophes, but perhaps not others. Humankind is nothing if not optimistic, even to the point of blindness. We are also an adaptable species. That will help.
  The distant perils of climate change are no longer very distant, however. Many have already begun to occur. We are capable of good works, altruism and wisdom, and a growing number of people have devoted their lives to helping civilization avoid the worst. We have a solution in hand: carbon taxes, increased investment in renewable and nuclear energy and decarbonization technology. As Jim Hansen told me, ''From a technology and economics standpoint, it is still readily possible to stay under two degrees Celsius.'' We can trust the technology and the economics. It's harder to trust human nature. Keeping the planet to two degrees of warming, let alone 1.5 degrees, would require transformative action. It will take more than good works and voluntary commitments; it will take a revolution. But in order to become a revolutionary, you need first to suffer.
  Hansen's most recent paper, published last year, announced that Earth is now as warm as it was before the last ice age, 115,000 years ago, when the seas were more than six meters higher than they are today. He and his team have concluded that the only way to avoid dangerous levels of warming is to bend the emissions arc below the x-axis. We must, in other words, find our way to ''negative emissions,'' extracting more carbon dioxide from the air than we contribute to it. If emissions, by miracle, do rapidly decline, most of the necessary carbon absorption could be handled by replanting forests and improving agricultural practices. If not, ''massive technological COâ‚‚ extraction,'' using some combination of technologies as yet unperfected or uninvented, will be required. Hansen estimates that this will incur costs of $89 trillion to $535 trillion this century, and may even be impossible at the necessary scale. He is not optimistic.
  Like Hansen, Rafe Pomerance is close to his granddaughter. When he feels low, he wears a bracelet she made for him. He finds it difficult to explain the future to her. During the Clinton administration, Pomerance worked on environmental issues for the State Department; he is now a consultant for Rethink Energy Florida, which hopes to alert the state to the threat of rising seas, and the chairman of Arctic 21, a network of scientists and research organizations that hope ''to communicate the ongoing unraveling of the Arctic.'' Every two months, he has lunch with fellow veterans of the climate wars -- E.P.A. officials, congressional staff members and colleagues from the World Resources Institute. They bemoan the lost opportunities, the false starts, the strategic blunders. But they also remember their achievements. In a single decade, they turned a crisis that was studied by no more than several dozen scientists into the subject of Senate hearings, front-page headlines and the largest diplomatic negotiation in world history. They helped summon into being the world's climate watchdog, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and initiated the negotiations for a treaty signed by nearly all of the world's nations.
  It is true that much of the damage that might have been avoided is now inevitable. And Pomerance is not the romantic he once was. But he still believes that it might not be too late to preserve some semblance of the world as we know it. Human nature has brought us to this place; perhaps human nature will one day bring us through. Rational argument has failed in a rout. Let irrational optimism have a turn. It is also human nature, after all, to hope.

Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson dismiss scientists’ determination that climate change is a key culprit in West Coast wildfires.
Rush Limbaugh told millions of his radio listeners to set aside any suggestion that climate change was the culprit for the frightening spate of wildfires ravaging California and the Pacific Northwest.
“Man-made global warming is not a scientific certainty; it cannot be proven, nor has it ever been,” Mr. Limbaugh declared on his Friday show, disregarding the mountains of empirical evidence to the contrary. He then pivoted to a popular right-wing talking point: that policies meant to curtail climate change are, in fact, an assault on freedom.
“Environmentalist wackos” — Mr. Limbaugh’s phrase — “want man to be responsible for it because they want to control your behavior,” the conservative host said on the show. He added that they “want to convince you that your lifestyle choices are the reason why all these fires are firing up out on the Left Coast.”
Hours later, that message leapt to prime time on Fox News, where the host Tucker Carlson said those who blamed climate change for the fires were merely reciting “a partisan talking point.”
“In the hands of Democratic politicians, climate change is like systemic racism in the sky,” Mr. Carlson told viewers. “You can’t see it, but rest assured, it’s everywhere, and it’s deadly. And like systemic racism, it is your fault.”
Mr. Limbaugh and Mr. Carlson are two of the most prominent commentators in the right-wing media sphere, where a rich history of climate denialism has merged with Trump-era cultural warfare to generate a deep skepticism of the notion that climate change is a factor in the fires devastating the West Coast.
Like President Trump, conservative media stars dismiss climate change — which scientists say is the primary cause of the conflagration — and point to the poor management of forestland by local (and, conveniently, Democratic) officials. Fringe right-wing websites, like The Gateway Pundit, have blamed left-wing arsonists, fueling false rumors that authorities say are impeding rescue efforts.
Visiting California on Monday to witness the destruction firsthand, Mr. Trump took Western states to task for failing to manage the forests properly. During a meeting with California officials who pushed him to acknowledge the role of climate change in the wildfires, the president said: “It’ll start getting cooler. You just watch.”
“I wish science agreed with you,” Wade Crowfoot, California’s secretary for natural resources, replied.
“Well, I don’t think science knows, actually,” Mr. Trump retorted.
The president’s comments were likely to resonate with fans of the conservative media personalities who routinely defend his agenda.
“This has nothing to do with climate change, it has nothing to do with man-made climate change, and it sure as hell would help if these forests in these timber areas were free to be properly managed, but they’re not,” Mark Levin, another popular right-wing radio host, said on his nationally syndicated show on Friday.
Like Mr. Carlson, Mr. Levin drew a link between climate advocacy and recent demonstrations for racial justice, suggesting that both causes — widely associated with liberals — offered a cloak for more sinister intentions.
“They want to talk man-made climate change because, out of this, they want to control you,” Mr. Levin said. “It’s just like the race stuff — ‘systemically racist’ — well, what do you want to do about it? Control you. Beat you down. You need to change your lifestyle, need to confess to something.”
Some right-wing writers see even darker origins in the outbreak of a lethal blaze.
The Gateway Pundit, a conspiracy website with a healthy online following — its chief writer, Jim Hoft, was welcomed to the White House by Mr. Trump — published posts asserting that left-wing anarchists were to blame, not the environment.
“Many arsonists have already been arrested in Oregon, Washington and California, but the Democrats continue to blame the wildfires on climate change,” a Gateway Pundit story said on Monday, alongside a video purportedly showing a woman in Oregon confronting an arsonist on her property. The site claimed that mainstream news outlets were ignoring this story because “it goes against their global warming and anti-gun narrative.”
A man in Oregon was charged last week with starting the destructive Almeda Fire in a small town that was under orders to evacuate. But the authorities say rising temperatures are a predominant cause of this year’s outbreak.
For the president’s political supporters, the notion that rogue firestarters are causing havoc is an enticing echo of a key message adopted by Mr. Trump and Republican in the presidential race: that regions of the country have been consumed by left-wing violence.
And Mr. Trump continues to play down environmental factors. Asked on Tuesday’s “Fox &amp; Friends” about his policy plans for fighting climate change, the president replied: “You have forests all over the world. You don’t have fires like you do in California.”
Californians have been debating how to reduce the risk of deadly blazes, with some officials arguing for more controlled burns. An August news release from the office of Gavin Newsom, the California governor, noted that the state’s forests were “highly vulnerable to catastrophic wildfire and in need of active, science-based management,” in part because of hotter and drier conditions created by climate change.
Mr. Newsom has called for the federal government to play a more active role in managing the state’s forests. About 58 percent of California forestland is controlled by the federal government; the state owns 3 percent.
For environmental advocacy groups, problematic media coverage of the wildfires is not limited to platforms associated with the right.
The Environmental Defense Fund, in a scathing post, said many mainstream news outlets had failed to draw a direct link between the widespread destruction and the dangerous consequences of a changing climate.
“It is like talking about the increased spread of Covid while ignoring the reason it is spreading,” the group wrote.

Highlight: A special Earth Day guest lesson, written with NASA&#8217;s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, a leader in global climate change research, and the Columbia University Earth Institute. It offers resources for teaching about this issue, while addressing important 21st-century literacy skills.

 Slide show from the 2014 article "Warming Temperatures Threaten Fragile Balance in Canadian Arctic."
An unprecedented abundance of publicly available scientific data combined with the demands of the new Next Generation Science Standards make it more important than ever to encourage students to think of themselves as "citizen scientists."
For this special Earth Day guest lesson, we've teamed up with            NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, a world leader in global climate-change research, along with its partner, the            Columbia University Earth Institute, to offer resources for teaching about this complex issue, all while addressing important 21st-century literacy skills. 
Below, a three-part unit designed to help students critically explore lines of climate change evidence, via resources from:
• New York Times reporters on the front lines of covering climate change, from daily reporting to special features like the            Temperature Rising series and the            Nature in the Balance issue of Science Times.
• Goddard Institute for Space Studies research from scientists at the forefront of bringing the public the most up-to-date science, as well as lessons from the Hot: One World, One Climate curriculum featured in the            GISS Climate Change in the Classroom Teacher Workshop. 
• The Learning Network's special compilation for Teaching About Climate With The New York Times.
• An invitation to a Google Hangout with NASA and Columbia University scientists for a lively and candid climate change discussion.
June 2, from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. Eastern.
Reserve a spot for you or a class of students to participate at the NASA Hangout Event page.
Thanks to the contributions of Carolyn Harris, GISS at Columbia University, Pushker Kharecha, GISS at Columbia University, Anthony Del Genio, NASA GISS, Gavin Schmidt, NASA GISS, and Ryan Goble, Glenbard Township District #87 Schools, the ideas below can, we hope, help students become more critical consumers and users of scientific information - and, ultimately, feel empowered to address real-world problems with what they learn. 
 Part I: The Basics: What Students Should Do Before Conducting Research 
Before students can do the citizen-science research in Part II, or complete any of the final projects in Part III, we suggest they do the following four things:
 1. Adopt a critical-thinking mind-set.  
Climate change news can be alarming - like the information in this Times article about the likelihood of "severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts on people and ecosystems." It can also be confusing, raising troubling questions and revealing            conflicting priorities, contentious debates and polarized views about everything from the science itself to ideas for tackling the problem. 
But climate change is the kind of messy, complex scientific problem that news reports increasingly ask us to make sense of. From the spread of the Ebola virus to securing cyberspaces, ensuring food and water safety and making energy choices, it helps to adopt the mind-set of a good scientist (and good critical thinker) to understand our changing world.  
You might frame students' study of this topic with these key questions:
• What do we know about recent climate change?
• How do we know it?
• Why does a changing climate matter?
• Given what we know, what can we do?
 2. Understand background information on climate change by hearing from experts.  
You might begin by asking students: What do you know, or think you know, right now about climate change? What questions do you have? What do you need to know? 
To do this, you might facilitate a basic K/W/L exercise as a starting point. When students are done, have them share both what they know (or think they know) and what questions they have in small groups. Ask them to note how much of what was in their own columns was echoed by similar statements or questions on others' sheets. Where did they see disagreement or confusion? Why do they think that is?
Another way to start? Try these four pre-assessment questions in the introductory Climate Change lesson (PDF) from the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies:
• How does climate influence human society?
• What is the difference between weather and climate?
• How do scientists know climate is changing?
• What are some important factors causing climate to change?
You might point out to students that the overwhelming majority (about 97 percent) of the world's climate scientists agree that accumulated scientific evidence shows Earth's average global temperature has increased significantly over the last 150 years (and rapidly over the past several decades), and that human activities are the primary cause. Specifically, the evidence tells us that the consequence of the cornerstone of the Industrial Revolution, and therefore modern civilization - carbon dioxide emission from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) - is now the dominant driver of long-term global climate change. 
Finally, as a brief introduction to climate change, you might watch NASA's GISS director, Gavin Schmidt, explaining climate change by using a medical analogy and in his 2014 TED Talk: 
Ask students which of their initial questions this TED talk helped answer. What new questions, concerns or ideas for inquiry did it raise for them?
 3. Consider why climate change matters. 
Does climate change affect people and the environment right now?  If so, how, who and where?
A few resources that can help you find answers to these questions include: 
• This 2013 Times article, "Climate Panel Cites Near Certainty on Warming," about a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, written by hundreds of the world's leading climate scientists.
• A video from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies scientist Pushker Kharecha that explains the role of humans in the climate change story.
In addition, many Times articles and videos from the last several years focus on this issue. For example, here is a short video from an article about Bangladesh, "Borrowed Time on Disappearing Land":
You might also consult these articles:
• For Ancient Maya, Climate Giveth and Taketh Away
• Warming Temperatures Threaten Fragile Balance in Canadian Arctic
• With Deaths of Forests, a Loss of Key Climate Protectors
• A Warming Planet Struggles to Feed Itself
• Rising Sea Levels Seen as a Threat to Coastal U.S.
To go further, this section of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies Hot Lesson series explores the Influence of Climate on Culture (PDF).
 4. Understand the scales we need to properly study climate change. 
Scientists study climate in many different time periods (decades, centuries and millenniums) and on several spatial scales (local, regional and global). 
One of the most important concepts needed to understand the significance of climate change is the distinction between the scale of weather and climate. The British geographer Andrew John Herbertson once wrote: "Climate is what on average we may expect. Weather is what we actually get."  
Have students read the April 2015 article "In California, a Wet Era May Be Ending," and discuss what it shows about the time and spatial scales scientists use to study climate change.  A related            article from the winter of 2014 explored the question, "If the world is really warming up, how come it is so darned cold?"
The video below, "Take the Dog for a Walk," uses an analogy to explain the difference between weather and climate. 
As students watch, have them think about these questions: 
• If you zoomed in and saw only a few steps of the person at any given time (say, the middle four steps), would that be enough information to know the overall shape of his path? 
• Keep in mind that this video is overly simplistic because his path happens to be a straight line. Despite the simplification, is this a good analogy for weather versus climate in your opinion?
• Does seeing these types of patterns by themselves necessarily tell you anything about their underlying causes?
 If you want to explore this topic more, here's a related GISS Hot Lesson: Weather Versus Climate (PDF). 
Now that your students have a little more background, let them know that the work they'll do in this section of the unit is based on real-world questions capturing the attention of climate scientists right now.  
These scientists are motivated by widespread, long-term changes they are observing in Earth's climate system - from unmistakable rises in atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases and global temperature over the last 150 years, to net loss of sea ice and ice from mountain glaciers and ice sheets to a rise in            global average sea level to large-scale            shifts in plant and            animal habitats, along with many other observable changes in the land, ocean and atmosphere. 
The questions can be investigated individually or divided up among groups of students who then brief one another. For a deeper dive, you can also use or adapt the GISS Hot Lesson: Climate Change: Lines of Evidence. (PDF)
As students work, they might aim at one or more of the final project ideas we list at the bottom of this post.
 Question 1: Is there evidence that Earth's average global temperature has increased over the last approximately 150 years? 
Students can break this down into direct and indirect lines of evidence. For direct evidence, start with the Times article "2014 Breaks Heat Record, Challenging Global Warming Skeptics," and this            Goddard Institute for Space Studies Research News article describing recent trends in global temperature. 
What data sources are used to directly measure global temperatures? Take a look at the graphic above. What can students say about the average decade-to-decade temperature change since the late 1970s? Does it appear that the average temperature of the 2000s (2000 to 2009) was warmer than that of the 1990s? How about the 1990s versus the 1980s and the 1980s versus the 1970s? Students can confirm their answers quantitatively by examining the actual GISS global temperature data set here.
Scientists are also finding abundant indirect evidence reflecting a rise in global average temperature since the late 1800s. Read 2014's "The Big Melt Accelerates," about the net loss of snow and ice around the world, and            this National Climate Assessment 2014 report about rise in global sea level. 
Why are widespread ice loss and global sea level rise indirect indicators of global temperature change? Does one of these phenomena affect the other? Challenge students to design a demonstration or experiment involving ice cubes and a glass of water to show their understanding of the concept.
 Question 2: Are concentrations of greenhouse gases increasing? 
 Scientists have known that trace greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are very important in determining global climate since the 19th century. Carbon dioxide is one of the most important greenhouse gases. Read 2013's "Heat-Trapping Gas Passes Milestone, Raising Fears" to find out what happened to carbon dioxide levels since the start of the Industrial Revolution. 
• In terms of percentages, how much has the atmospheric carbon dioxide level changed since pre-industrial times?"
• Based on the article, how unusual is this change in the context of Earth's history over the past 800,000 years?
• How far back in time might we have to go back to find similar carbon dioxide levels?
• Is the recent change connected to burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas)? 
• If so, what is the key chemical element being burned that is common to all three types of fuel? Based on this, what do you think happens to carbon dioxide levels when trees are burned? How about when they regrow?
For more insight on the effects of carbon dioxide on climate, look at the GISS Research Brief discussing How Carbon Dioxide Controls Earth's Temperature.  Carbon dioxide is one of many greenhouse gases; water vapor, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone and many others are also important. 
 Question 3:  What are the main causes of 20th- and 21st-century global climate change? 
Being able to discern the contribution of both natural and human factors on the rise in Earth's average global temperature is crucial to understanding the influence of human activity on our planet's climate.  
One place you can start is the essay "Drivers of 20th-Century Climate Change," written by the former Goddard Institute for Space Studies  scientist Drew Shindell for the American Museum of Natural History's online Climate Change Science Seminar.  Other resources include this            United States Environmental Protection Agency page and this            Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Frequently Asked Questions page.
After your own critical review of the data and scientific explanations, how would you explain the relative significance of natural vs. human factors on recent global climate change?
What scientific evidence do you have to support your claims?
 Question 4. What are the risks of climate change?  
"Panel's Warning on Climate Risk: Worst Is Yet to Come," reported The Times in March 2014. This article describes the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on climate impacts and adaptation strategies.  
Is climate change already having widespread effects around the world? Are these effects limited to the land, or is the ocean also affected? 
Use these Times articles covering research findings to help students compile a list of the range of potential impacts climate change may have, on everything from food systems to            flooding,            water supply,            animal and plant populations and            extreme weather.             Even the microbes, it seems, may be on the move, as this video explains:
More and more extreme weather events are in the headlines. However, there is sometimes a climate twist in the story. An            active area of scientific research is analyzing the relationship between Earth's warming climate and extreme weather events like droughts, floods, heat waves, wildfires and destructive storms.  
Science is clear on the point that one extreme event like the 2003 heat wave in Europe that caused 50,000 deaths or Hurricane Sandy, which  devastated New York and New Jersey coastal areas, is not - on its own - connected to long-term climate change. Only when scientists look at statistics over a long period for the frequency, duration and severity of these events can they draw conclusions about whether  these events have been affected by climate change over the same period. But according to the 2014 United States National Climate Assessment, "Human-induced climate change has already increased the number and strength of some of these extreme events," in particular heat waves and extreme downpours.
Questions to think about: 
• What are some ways in which recent climate change has already affected both human society and natural ecosystems? 
• If the recent global warming trend continues, do scientists expect these impacts to be magnified, reduced or to stay basically the same? 
• Do they conclude that adaptation to climate change will be sufficient by itself? 
• Based on this article, what are some reasons the Defense Department regards climate change as a major national security issue? 
 Question 5.  Do you think action is needed to mitigate human-caused climate change?  
If, at the end of all their research, students agree that action is warranted, what are the science-based approaches being considered? 
Along with its report on the impacts of climate change discussed above, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a report last year devoted to mitigation of climate change, which The Times covered in "Climate Efforts Falling Short, U.N. Panel Says." 
Ask students: 
• Is there widespread agreement among the world's governments that climate change is a major problem that needs to be mitigated?
• Does the scientific evidence support the notion that reducing greenhouse gas emissions will slow down global climate change?
• Why do you think energy supply is one of the main focuses of mitigation research? 
• Are most mitigation approaches simple - like switching light bulbs, recycling more, or driving hybrid cars - or will they entail fundamental changes in the way human society operates?
• What might be the costs associated with mitigation or adaptation? Do researchers think the benefits will outweigh the costs?
• How urgent is all of this - do scientists think we have a lot of time to achieve internationally agreed upon climate change targets?
• What are some consequences scientists predict if mitigation efforts are delayed, in terms of likely climate impacts and economic costs? 
As a culmination of all their research and discussion, students might consider doing any or all of the following. For each, remind them to be sure to support their claims with evidence.
 Take a Stand 
Pose the following problem to students, then invite them to debate the idea as a class, create short, persuasive videos to answer the question, or write editorials for the local or school newspaper making their own suggestions:
Knowing what you now know about the underlying science, if you were an influential world leader - say of a major developed country like the United States - on which climate change issues would you focus your efforts? Why? What might stand in your way, and how would you address those issues? 
 Create 'Explainers' for Young People 
You know you really understand a concept when you can teach it to someone else. Challenge students to write and teach a lesson plan for a neighboring elementary school or create a book, video or website aimed at young children that explains some of what they learned through the reading, research and discussion they have done. They might focus on answering the very questions we posed at the beginning of this lesson:
• What do we know about recent climate change?  
• How do we know it?
• Why does a changing climate matter?
• Given what we know, what can we do?
 Create Data Visualizations That Can Help People Understand Climate Change Issues 
The New York Times is known for interactive storytelling, but media of all kinds are beginning to rely more and more heavily on data visualization to help explain the meaning behind numbers. To think about how to help students do this with climate change data, you might first read two Learning Networks posts, "           Reader Idea | Telling Stories With Data" and "           Data Visualized: More on Teaching With Infographics." 
Then, challenge your students to choose some aspect of what they've learned that especially interests them - whether threatened animal species, extreme weather, the need to understand the difference between weather and climate, or anything else - and find interesting, informative ways to represent it visually. 
 Help Out by Collecting Data for a Continuing Citizen Science Project 
You can find lists of such projects in many places. For instance, on the Cornell University website, you can find links to projects on everything from monitoring sea turtle nests in Florida to tracking pollen release for allergy sufferers to collecting data on how butterfly populations are affected by climate change.
Here are a few more pages with links to projects:
• Environmental Protection Agency | You Can Be a Scientist, Too
• National Weather Service | Cooperative Observer Program
• National Park Service | Citizen Science
• Union of Concerned Scientists | You + Your Computer = Carbon Detective
• The Learning Network has a "backyard science" lesson on tallying local species to learn about diversity.

Returning strategic parts of the world’s farmlands to nature could help mitigate both climate change and biodiversity loss, a new study found.
The twin crises of climate change and biodiversity loss are intertwined: Storms and wildfires are worsening while as many as one million species are at risk of extinction.
The solutions are not small or easy, but they exist, scientists say.
A global road map, published Wednesday in Nature, identifies a path to soaking up almost half of the carbon dioxide that has built up since the Industrial Revolution and averting more than 70 percent of the predicted animal and plant extinctions on land. The key? Returning a strategic 30 percent of the world’s farmlands to nature.
It could be done, the researchers found, while preserving an abundant food supply for people and while also staying within the time scale to keep global temperatures from rising past 2 degrees Celsius, the upper target of the Paris Agreement.
“It’s one of the most cost effective ways of combating climate change,” said Bernardo B.N. Strassburg, one of the study’s authors and an environmental scientist with Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro and the International Institute for Sustainability. “And it’s one of the most important ways of avoiding global extinctions.”
The researchers used a map from the European Space Agency that breaks down the surface of the planet into a grid of parcels classified by ecosystem: forests, wetlands, shrub lands, grasslands and arid regions. Using an algorithm they developed, the scientists evaluated which swaths, if returned to their natural states, would yield the highest returns for mitigating climate change and biodiversity loss at the lowest cost.
It was not enough simply to lay one result on top of the other. “If you really want to optimize for all three things at the same time,” Dr. Strassburg said, “that leads to a different map.”
A similar and complementary tool, The Global Safety Net, was released last month. It identifies the most strategic 50 percent of the planet to protect, filtering for rare species, high biodiversity, large mammal landscapes, intact wilderness and climate stabilization.
A growing number of campaigns seek to address the world’s environmental emergency by conserving or restoring vast swaths of the planet. The Bonn Challenge aims to restore 350 million hectares by 2030. The Campaign for Nature is pushing leaders to protect 30 percent of the planet by 2030.
In the latest study, the scientists found that benefits rise and fall depending on how much land is restored.
Relinquishing 15 percent of strategic farmlands, for example, could spare 60 percent of extinctions and sequester about 30 percent of the built up carbon in the atmosphere. The authors estimate that at the global level, 55 percent of farmland could be returned to nature while maintaining current levels of food production by using existing agricultural land more effectively and sustainably.
“It’s really impressive,” said J. Leighton Reid, a specialist in ecological restoration at Virginia Tech who was not involved in the study. “The authors do a good job of acknowledging some of the limitations of the work at the same time as they’re proposing this big vision.”
The biggest challenges appear to be political will and finding the money to pay farmers to restore so much land to nature. But the authors point to the hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars per year that subsidize fossil fuels and unsustainable farming practices.
“There’s a lot of money available for investment,” said Robin Chazdon, a longtime biologist with the University of Connecticut and one of the study’s authors. “The world is invested in destruction.”
The study was requested by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, a global treaty that aims to preserve biodiversity. One of the authors, David Cooper, is its deputy executive secretary.
A recent report by the convention showed that world leaders had failed to meet their last round of targets. The United States is the only state in the world, with the exception of the Vatican, that has not signed the treaty.
The study will be used to help inform global commitments at the United Nations biodiversity and climate conventions next year. But because the new study highlights nature’s disregard for national borders, it presents a diplomatic challenge.
“This lays out the much higher benefits overall if you ignore the country boundaries and just look at where these priorities are,” said Dr. Chazdon. The most strategic places are distributed very unevenly; tropical forests and wetlands, for example, hold outsized potential for carbon storage and biodiversity protection.
“Do we say, ‘We’re just going to forego all those benefits and be provincial about this?’” she asked. “Or are there ways to cooperate internationally?”
The authors note that the conservation of existing wilderness remains the most important way to protect biodiversity, and see their proposed restoration as a critical addition. Other essential steps Dr. Strassburg listed: Stopping the use of fossil fuels; reducing food, energy and plastic waste; and making sustainable choices when buying things like food, cars and clothes.
“Once consumers start changing their patterns,” he said, “companies react really quickly.”

Climate Change Becomes Major Fund-Raising Issue As Donors Flock to Biden


 



Climate Change Becomes Major Fund-Raising Issue As Donors Flock to Biden

WASHINGTON -- In 2009, the Obama administration's environmental team called a group of climate activists to the White House to deliver a message: Climate change doesn't sell and only provokes economic attacks from the right that are too difficult to counter. 
  As former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. prepares to assume the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, the changing climate is now a core campaign issue -- and a focus for fund-raising. Plans for tackling rising global temperatures will be in the spotlight Wednesday at the Democratic convention. And Mr. Biden has raised more than $15 million in candidate contributions from hundreds of new donors who specifically identify with climate change as a cause.
  That climate-specific fund-raising may make up just about 5 percent of the total he has raised so far. It's dwarfed by fossil fuel donations to President Trump, who took in $10 million from a single fund-raiser in June, held by the oil billionaire Kelcy Warren, and whose super PAC, America First Action, has seen millions pour in from coal and oil moguls, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign donations.
  It is not known how much unregulated money is going to super PACs aligned with Democrats from other self-identified climate donors.
  But the hard money climate donations represent a growing counterweight to oil, gas and coal money that has long warped the energy conversation in Washington. Self-identified ''climate donors'' are a new phenomenon in the 2020 election and are working overtime to show candidates that campaigning to eliminate emissions from fossil fuels pays -- in cash.
  ''That is a sea change. We've now got a class of people called 'climate donors' in a way we had environmental donors before,'' said David Bookbinder, general counsel for the Niskanen Center, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington.
  ''Climate has taken over as an issue on its own. People are finally understanding that we have a truly existential crisis on our hands,'' Mr. Bookbinder added. Publicly embracing climate change solutions was viewed as a political liability, as recently as a decade ago, he said. During Barack Obama's re-election run in 2012, the issue was hardly mentioned.
  Now donors are sending a new message: ''We want to make it easy to do the right thing. We should reward campaigns and candidates for having the right policies,'' said Matt Rogers, a co-founder of the digital thermostat company Nest.
  Mr. Rogers and his wife, Swati Mylavarapu, who chaired Pete Buttigieg's fund-raising apparatus during the Democratic primary, helped host the first major climate change fund-raiser for Mr. Biden in June along with Tom Steyer, the billionaire climate activist and former hedge-fund executive who also ran for president.
  The group, which calls itself Climate Leaders for Biden, raised $4 million from about two dozen donors during a 20-minute Zoom call with Mr. Biden.
  Until last week when Mr. Biden and Senator Kamala Harris made their debut as running mates, raising $34.2 million in 24 hours -- $3 million of that in a single hour -- it was one of the biggest fund-raisers of his campaign.
  Two subsequent small fund-raisers hosted by Climate Leaders for Biden also raised about $4 million each. Julia Louis-Dreyfus headlined one of the group's events in late July, which brought in nearly $2 million from about 800 donors, according to the organizers.
  During the online fund-raiser the star of the political comedy Veep recalled one episode in which her team came up with the ''weakest environmental gesture that my idiot character could possibly make, so that she wouldn't offend the fossil fuel industry'' -- replacing plastic utensils with recyclable ones.
  But, Ms. Louis-Dreyfus said, ''That's actually more than Trump has done for the environment in four years,'' calling him ''actually worse than a fictional president with a team of professional writers working 24-7 to make her as bad as possible.''
  The Trump campaign has tried to turn such donations against Mr. Biden.
  ''Is Joe Biden really OK with filling his campaign coffers at the expense of the tens of millions of American workers who will lose their jobs from his radical policies and the millions of American families whose housing taxes will go up to pay for these socialist proposals?'' Courtney Parella, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, asked in a statement.
  Other deep-pocketed hosts associated with Climate Leaders for Biden include Nat Simons, a senior managing director of the investment firm Meritage Group, who with his wife, Laura Baxter-Simons, runs the Sea Change Foundation, a major funder of clean energy work. Lawrence H. Linden, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner who runs the Linden Trust for Conservation, is also in the group, along with Mark Gallogly, co-founder of the private investment firm Centerbridge Partners L.P. and his wife Elizabeth Strickler, and Nicole Systrom, founder of the Sutro Energy Group, a clean energy investment firm in San Francisco. (Such investment firms and the energy companies they fund would stand to profit from a multi-trillion-dollar government effort to combat climate change.)
  A separate group called Clean Energy for Biden has about 4,500 members and has held 30 events that include fund-raising, policy analysis and get-out-the-vote efforts, said Dan Reicher, a co-founder of the group who served in the Department of Energy under President Clinton and President Obama. They have raised about $1.1 million for Mr. Biden.
  A third group, GiveGreen, is a coalition of the fund-raising arms of various environmental groups that has worked with Climate Leaders for Biden but also raises money for state and local races. As of Tuesday the group had helped raise $30.39 million for races up and down the ballot, a figure that includes the $15 million that Climate Leaders for Biden raised for the candidate, said Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters.
  That total has already broken the group's record of $23 million raised during the 2018 midterm elections. The group raised $8 million in the 2016 election.
  Unlike past presidential cycles in which activists openly said they were donating in an effort to prod the candidate to prioritize climate change, donors with these two groups said Mr. Biden and Ms. Harris already are where the donor community wants them to be on the issue.
  Several donors said they were not early supporters of Mr. Biden, having preferred candidates that were more outspoken on climate change, but they praised the former vice president for working with youth leaders in groups like the Sunrise movement and issuing an aggressive plan that calls for $2 trillion in spending over four years with a clean energy standard and 40 percent of spending devoted to low-income communities.
  ''He obviously has decided it's a winning political strategy, and that's important,'' Mr. Linden said.
  Mr. Linden, a longtime Democratic donor, said President Trump's antagonism to climate change and the dozens of environmental rollbacks the Trump administration engineered had convinced him for the first time to persuade other donors to give specifically on climate.
  ''This election versus the one four years ago, climate has become a really big deal. Biden is taking ads out about it, he talks about it a lot and the total amount of funding he has raised that is tagged with the 'climate donor' slug is big. Before this it just wasn't a factor,'' he said. Ms. Systrom also noted that in the 2016 campaign ''climate wasn't a big issue'' on the campaign trail. She donated at the time to Mrs. Clinton, but said it wasn't motivated solely by global warming.
  Now it is, she said, and the same goes for donors she has helped recruit.
  ''It's been a big draw. They are people like myself who gave in the past but now at higher levels because they were excited about the climate work that Biden is doing,'' she said.
  Betsy Taylor, president of the consulting firm Breakthrough Strategies and a longtime adviser to climate donors, said the dynamics are virtually unrecognizable from 2009 when she and other activists were told that ''clean energy jobs'' and ''energy security'' were safer ways to frame an environmental message.
  ''Back then the conventional wisdom was, 'Don't fund-raise with political donors on climate change. Don't even talk about climate change,'' Ms. Taylor said. Eleven years later, she said, Democratic donors ''want action'' on fossil fuels.
  ''I would anticipate a huge river of money coming into the Biden campaign on the issue. They want Vice President Biden to really step up and lead on this,'' she said.

We have to adapt to it, too.
This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Gov. Gavin Newsom, standing in an ash-coated clearing scorched by the largest wildfires in California’s recorded history, last week vowed to fast-track his state’s transition to 100 percent renewable energy, a target previously set for 2045. “This is a climate damn emergency,” he declared.
Such commitments may be necessary for the global effort to stop climate change, but as Mr. Newsom seemed to acknowledge, they are no longer sufficient to prevent megafires of the kind now burning the American West and poisoning its skies. Scientists have estimated that even if aggressive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions were made today, it would still take decades for them to have any noticeable effect on rising temperatures.
“If the fires of 2020 horrify you, as they should,” David Wallace-Wells writes for New York magazine, “consider that by 2050, when the benefits of fast climate action will only begin to arrive, the area burned annually in the West is expected to have at least doubled, and perhaps quadrupled.”
Given this grim prognosis, how can the West minimize the loss of life and destruction that global warming is already causing, and what do other U.S. regions need to do to adapt? Here’s what people are saying.
Fighting fire with fire (and policy)
Fixing forest management
President Trump has rejected the scientific consensus about the clear relationship between the changing climate and intensifying wildfires, instead seeking to blame poor forest management. Many argue there is a kernel of truth to the latter claim, even if it implicates Mr. Trump and his predecessors, since most of California’s and Oregon’s forests are federally held.
For more than a century, the State of California has treated wildfires as unqualified threats, extinguishing them whenever they occur. But the problem with that strategy, Elizabeth Weil writes for ProPublica, is that California is naturally primed to catch fire: Before Euro-American settlement in the 1800s, fires burned about 1.5 million of California’s 100 million acres every year. After decades of aggressive fire suppression, forests once periodically cleared by less intense wildfires are now blanketed with natural fuel.
“We dug ourselves into a deep, dangerous fuel imbalance due to one simple fact,” Ms. Weil writes. “We live in a Mediterranean climate that’s designed to burn, and we’ve prevented it from burning anywhere close to enough for well over 100 years. Now climate change has made it hotter and drier than ever before, and the fire we’ve been forestalling is going to happen, fast, whether we plan for it or not.”
Ecologists, forest managers and firefighters Ms. Weil spoke to agreed on one vital solution: To control fires, humans have to start more themselves. As my colleague Jill Cowan explains, California’s Native American tribes had for thousands of years used controlled fires to keep wild ones in check. As of 2017, though, only 13,000 acres per year are subject to prescribed burns in California, and the practice is similarly rare in Oregon and Washington.
The challenge posed by the backlog is staggering: To bring California’s fires back under control, researchers at Stanford estimated that the state might need to burn or thin a fifth of its land, an area about the size of Maine.
Lack of funding and opposition among residents make prescribed burns a politically difficult proposition, Ms. Cowan explains, but the alternative is the crisis playing out before us. “The big picture solution is realizing there is going to be a lot more fire on the landscape,” Daniel Swain, a California climate expert, told her. “I don’t see how we get out of this without allowing a lot more to burn.”
Building more resilient housing
As the former Times climate reporter Kendra Pierre-Louis wrote in 2018, many of the deadliest and costliest fires start not in the heart of isolated forests but at the wildland-urban interface, where developed and undeveloped land meet. About 44 million houses, equivalent to one in every three in the country, are in these zones, and the number is rising particularly fast in California. Wildfires already pose the greatest danger to people in the wildland-urban interface, and their presence there tends to increase the number of fires that start in the first place.
Experts say that governments could impose regulations to make housing developments more resilient, including stipulations for fire-resistant building materials and moats of cleared vegetation known as defensible space. California adopted many of these standards, some of the strictest in the country, in 2008. One analysis of the devastating Camp Fire that killed 85 people in 2018 determined that about 51 percent of the 350 single-family homes built to the new codes escaped damage, compared with just 18 percent of the 12,100 homes built earlier.
But there are considerable obstacles to making such fortifications more widespread. In many states, developers have resisted new regulations. Retrofitting the millions of houses already built can be prohibitively expensive. And in the aftermath of a fire, the pressure to rebuild often wins out over safety considerations.
“At this point we’ve learned a lot about how to engineer homes and communities so that they can be more survivable,” said Max Moritz, a wildfire expert affiliated with the University of California, Santa Barbara. “But these lessons aren’t being implemented fast enough.”
Unsprawling the suburbs
Last year, The Los Angeles Times editorial board repeated the call for increased fire resiliency, but argued that it was foolish to pretend that housing regulations would eliminate the danger created by building and rebuilding in high-fire-risk areas. “Cities and state agencies are talking about ‘managed retreat’ — or relocating threatened homes — from communities facing coastal erosion or flooding,” the board wrote. “Why is there not a similar policy discussion in areas that repeatedly burn?”
One reason, as Mr. Newsom put it, is that the notion runs counter to California’s “pioneering spirit.” Another reason, as the Times editorial board wrote last year, is that California’s sprawl is driven in part by soaring housing prices that have pushed people out of cities. Prohibitions against building in fire-prone areas would therefore entail building denser, affordable housing in urban economic centers.
To the Times columnist Farhad Manjoo, the challenge that lies before the state is nothing less than a transformation of its way of life. “Californian suburbia, the ideal of much of American suburbia, was built and sold on the promise of endless excess — everyone gets a car, a job, a single-family home and enough water and gasoline and electricity to light up the party,” he writes. “But it is long past obvious that infinitude was a false promise. Traffic, sprawl, homelessness and ballooning housing costs are all consequences of our profligacy with the land and our other resources.”
Updating the fire safety curriculum
While some devastating fires are caused by negligent utility companies and natural causes, most are caused, intentionally or unintentionally, by people. In Washington State, for example, people have started more than 1,300 fires so far this year. The Seattle Times editorial board argues that climate change has only increased the need to cultivate a more rigorous ethic of fire prevention among the public.
“Vigilance about fire safety must be an everyday concern. From cigarette butts tossed on the roadside to campfires and fire pits, each outdoor spark is a threat to bucolic wild lands, property and life during these long parched weeks,” the board writes. “Every Washington resident and business shares this responsibility. Schools and public-safety bulletins should urgently spread this gospel. The message must be amplified each summer.”
Thinking beyond the West Coast
In the coming decades, no part of the United States will remain unaffected by climate change. As Abrahm Lustgarten writes in The New York Times Magazine, Americans have been conditioned not to respond to climate threats as people in the rest of the world do, possessed of a boundless faith in the capacity of money and technology to domesticate nature. But across the country, he says, not just in the West, the gap between what the climate can destroy and what money can replace is growing.
Florida officials have already acknowledged that safeguarding some roadways against rising seas will be unaffordable. In recent years, the Southeast has had to contend with what may be the emergence of its own dangerous annual fire season. And for the first time, the nation’s federal flood-insurance program is now mandating that some of its payouts be used to retreat from damage-prone areas. The insurance, real estate and private-equity industries are beginning to register the risk, he writes, and “it will soon prove too expensive to maintain the status quo.”
What replaces it is still an open question. According to a federal report, the United States will need to spend billions of dollars to fortify its coastlines, rebuild its sewer systems, rethink its farming practices and potentially relocate millions of people from the coasts. What adaptation looks like will vary region by region, but writ large, Matt Shaw argues in The Times, the country has to learn to accommodate nature instead of just pushing back against it.
“All of these plans incorporate elements of resilience; none of them considers abandoning neighborhoods or cities altogether,” he writes. “But they recognize that fortification alone is a dead end, and that true resilience that leads to adaptation will require us to give up any notion of maintaining the status quo.”

WHAT YOU’RE SAYING
Here’s what readers had to say about the last edition: “ What if We Have to Wait Years for a Coronavirus Vaccine?”
Julie, 69, from Colorado: “The article describes where we might get to with partially effective vaccines and three types of treatments. The conclusion addresses fatality but not the long-term morbidity that is beginning to appear.”
John, 70, from California: “I was about 5 years old when the Salk polio vaccine was released. We were terrified of polio. Everyone knew or knew of someone who had contracted polio. You might have to use the dreaded ‘iron lung’ to survive. You could be paralyzed for life. Of course, we all got vaccinated. … Having read your piece, it occurred to me to see, compared to Covid-19, how many people contracted polio and how many died. The answer is a lot fewer than I imagined. According to the C.D.C. there were an average of 16,316 infections and 1,879 deaths per year from 1951 to 1954. We lived in mortal terror of polio. Compared to Covid-19 it was no pandemic. In less than a year nearly 200,000 people have died. That is more than 100 times the number that succumbed to polio each year.”

Highlight: We’ve gathered graphs previously published in The Times that illustrate different aspects of climate change. Plus, we suggest strategies for helping students analyze what they see.

Climate change is a gradual process. If you simply measure air temperature, atmospheric carbon dioxide or sea-ice thickness in any given year, you won’t be able to see the full picture of how the planet’s weather patterns are changing. That’s why graphs showing change over time can be such a powerful teaching resource to help students better understand climate trends.
In this teaching resource, we have gathered 24 graphs previously published elsewhere in The New York Times that relate to climate change. In the first section, we discuss teaching strategies for using these graphs in the classroom. In the second section, we present a collection of graphs organized by topic: melting ice, rising seas, changing ocean temperature, changing air temperature, rising carbon emissions, impacts on humans, intensifying storms and contradicting attitudes.
_________
Part I: Strategies for Teaching With Graphs
Each week in “What’s Going On in This Graph?,” we spotlight an engaging graph previously published elsewhere in The Times and pair it with a simple set of questions: What do you notice? What do you wonder? What do you think is going on in this graph? On Wednesdays, teachers from the American Statistical Association provide live facilitation in our comments section to respond to students as they post analyses and consider what story the graph is telling. Then, at the end of the week, we add an end-of-activity “reveal” that shares the original article containing the graph, highlights from the moderation, related statistical concepts and helpful vocabulary.
The philosophy behind our approach is to let students begin analyzing graphs with the skills they will most naturally and successfully use — simple noticing and wondering. From there, students can simultaneously build confidence and acquire new conceptual understanding. Over time, as their critical thinking skills develop and their vocabulary grows, students’ analyses become more sophisticated.
Below, we detail step-by-step instructions for how to adapt this approach to teaching with graphs to your classroom, and we provide examples from students who have participated in our weekly conversations about climate change-related graphs.
1. What do you notice?
In this Stats and Stories podcast, Sharon Hessney, the curator of “What’s Going On in This Graph?,” describes the benefits of the Notice &amp; Wonder approach: “Noticing and wondering has a ‘low floor and a high ceiling.’ Every student can notice something in a graph. There are dots on it; it’s about different countries. As they hear each other’s noticings, they dig deeper. They’ll discover more by comparing and contrasting aspects of the graph and by relating these noticings to the world they know.”
So, what can simply noticing look like in action? Here are examples of what students noticed about the above graph about summer temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere.
I noticed that the graph is only focusing on the summer temperatures, and not the overall temperatures. The base year has a 29-year difference while the other years have a 10-year difference. The graph does not cover the years 1981-1982. — Deija Robins from California
I noticed that as the years go by, the mean or the center of the graph shifts farther to the right. This upward trend seems to be in a stage of rapid acceleration and I wonder if it will continue to increase at the same rate in the coming years. — Brooke Shalam from New York City
I noticed that as the years went on the temperatures became hot and extremely hot more frequently. I also noticed that the distribution of the temperatures starts as an approximately symmetric distribution and becomes skewed right over the years. — Chandler B from Georgia
2. What do you wonder?
Discussing what students notice and wonder, either online or in the classroom, is an important part of the learning process. Ms. Hessney recommends: “We think the best practice for doing ‘What’s Going on in This Graph?’ is first, for students to converse about what they notice and wonder either individually or in small groups, and then to discuss as a whole class. By hearing other people’s ideas, students form more and deeper stories from the graph.”
Here are examples of student wonderings about the same graph.
I wonder if the progressing extreme heat will affect our animals and even, human beings. Will this affect us in dangerous ways? For example, will we die from heat stroke, Will the water sources dry up and the animals die of thirst? These are my wonders for this graph. — Ruby Casey from New Hampshire
We wonder what “extremely cold,” “normal” etc. means in terms of temperatures. We also wondered if there were outliers at all. It seems like there were outliers on the hot side and then outliers on the cold side. We wonder if something similar is happening in the southern hemisphere and if this type of trend happens in the winter, too. We also wonder if these are actual temperatures and where was the data gathered — cities, country, novice weather people as opposed to trained weather people We think that global warming is being illustrated by this graph. — @mathteacher24 from Bethlehem, Pa.
3. Discuss.
An essential part of our approach to teaching with graphs is that students don’t do their thinking in a vacuum. On The Learning Network, moderators from the American Statistical Association provide students with feedback on their comments. Plus, students get to read what others have to say, and have a chance to reply as well — whether they are in the same classroom or on the other side of the globe.
In the screen shot below, you can see a student, Madison from New Jersey, responding to Christian in Pittsburgh. One of the questions Madison asks is, “Are these the effects of naturally increasing temperatures, or the doing of man made emissions?”
4. What’s going on in this graph? 
Just like photographs, graphs tell stories. After students have “noticed and wondered,” we ask them: What’s going on in this graph? What story can it tell?
Here are some examples of the comments students made about the above graph about winter temperatures.
This graph shows that although the average winter temperature in the US is not increasing at a steady rate, overall the temperatures are getting warmer with time. This is in favour of the discussion about climate change causing global warming. — Tatyana from New Zealand
This graph depicts how the winter temperatures from the 1900s differ from the 2000s. And how the temperatures are gradually getting warmer. This could be happening due to global warming or maybe how they say the sun is gradually getting closer and closer to our planet. — Matthew Laing from Philadelphia
From brief observations, I can conclude that this is a graph depicting the differences between the average winter temperature in 1900 and the present average winter temperature at the time. Because of this, I’m curious if an increase in air pollution, carbon dioxide, and deforestation is responsible for the overall increase of winter temperatures on Earth. This graph could capture how pollution and an increase of carbon dioxide within the atmosphere because the gas prevents small bits of heat from the sun from escaping the Earth’s atmosphere, forcing it to bounce back to the Earth’s surface as more thermal energy from the sun reaches our planet. A similar phenomenon has been present on Venus, which, due to the gases within Venus’ atmosphere capturing the majority of thermal energy from the sun, has made Venus the hottest planet in the Solar System. — Ben S. from Allen Tex.
5. Come up with a catchy headline.
This past summer Robert Lochel, a math teacher in the Hatboro-Horsham School District, mentioned to us that he always asked students to write a catchy headline after they were done noticing and wondering. We liked the idea so much, we added it to our weekly protocol.
Here are a few examples of students’ headlines about the graph above.
 “You Thought This Winter Was Cold? Check This Graph,” by Nathan of Virginia
 “Is Earth on the Hot Seat?,” by Kero K. and Jon I. from Hampton High School
 “Dreaming of a Green Christmas,” by Isaac from Hampton High School
 “Doomsday Deviation,” by Michael, Harper, Joseph and Owen from Hampton High School

Part II: A Collection of Climate Change-Related Graphs by The Times
The graph above illustrates how rising temperatures could affect ice cover across 1.4 million lakes in the Northern Hemisphere. It is one of scores of graphs related to climate change that The Times has published in the last few years. We hope that by collecting a selection of these graphs in one place, organized by topic and accompanied by links to the original Times articles, we are providing teachers with a valuable resource for teaching about climate trends.
With any one of these graphs, you can have students notice, wonder and do the sequence of strategies recommended above.
And here is one more teaching idea: Choose a handful of these graphs and ask students to select the one they think is most valuable for teaching the general public about Earth’s changing climate. Then they can explain why they selected that graph.
Melting Ice
We Charted Arctic Sea Ice for Nearly Every Day Since 1979. You’ll See a Trend. | Arctic sea ice has been in a steep decline since scientists started using satellites to measure it 40 years ago. And the 10 lowest ice extents have all been recorded since 2007.
As Greenland Melts, Where’s the Water Going? | Each year, Greenland loses 270 billion tons of ice as the planet warms. New research shows that some of the water may be trapped in the ice sheet, which could change how scientists think about global sea levels.
In the Arctic, the Old Ice Is Disappearing | In the winter of 2018, the Arctic Ocean hit a record low for ice older than five years. Scientists say that summers in the Arctic may be ice-free in the future.
Rising Seas
What Could Disappear | These 2012 maps show coastal and low-lying areas that would be permanently flooded, without engineered protection, with a five-foot sea level rise over the current level. Percentages are the portion of dry, habitable land within the city limits of places listed that would be permanently submerged.
Changing Ocean Temperature
Ocean Warming Is Accelerating Faster Than Thought, New Research Finds | An analysis concluded that Earth’s oceans are heating up 40 percent faster on average than a United Nations panel estimated five years ago, a finding with dire implications for climate change.
Changing Air Temperature
Nights Are Warming Faster Than Days. Here’s Why That’s Dangerous. | Nationwide, summer evening temperatures have risen at nearly twice the rate of daytime temperatures, putting older people, the sick, and young children at greater risk during heat waves.
It’s Official: 2018 Was the Fourth-Warmest Year on Record | The Earth’s temperature in 2018 was more than one degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, above the average temperature of the late 19th century, when humans started pumping large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
How Much Hotter Is Your Hometown Than When You Were Born? | As the world warms because of human-induced climate change, most of us can expect to see more days when temperatures hit 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) or higher. See how your hometown has changed so far and how much hotter it may get.
Of 21 Winter Olympic Cities, Many May Soon Be Too Warm to Host the Games | Because of climate change, by midcentury many prior Winter Games locations may be too warm to ever host the Olympics again.
Rising Carbon Emissions
Here’s How Far the World Is From Meeting Its Climate Goals | This 2017 graph shows how two years after countries signed a landmark climate agreement in Paris, the world remains far off course from preventing drastic global warming in the decades ahead.
U.S. Carbon Emissions Surged in 2018 Even as Coal Plants Closed | America’s carbon dioxide emissions rose by 3.4 percent in 2018, the biggest increase in eight years.
Where Americans (Mostly) Agree on Climate Change Policies, in Five Maps | Americans are politically divided over climate change, but there’s broader consensus around some of the solutions.
The U.S. Is the Biggest Carbon Polluter in History. It Just Walked Away From the Paris Climate Deal. | The United States, with its love of big cars, big houses and blasting air-conditioners, has contributed more than any other country to the atmospheric carbon dioxide that is scorching the planet.
How Does Your State Make Electricity? | Over all, fossil fuels still dominate electricity generation in the United States. But the shift from coal to natural gas has helped to lower carbon dioxide emissions and other pollution.
Affecting Humans
Migrants Are on the Rise Around the World, and Myths About Them Are Shaping Attitudes | Rising average temperatures are already pushing people from their homes in many middle-income countries, according to research by Cristina Cattaneo and Giovanni Peri, increasing migration from rural areas to urban centers and across borders to other nations. As warming continues in the coming decades, it will probably push people from agricultural areas to urban areas and from the global South to the richer global North.
A Rise in Murder? Let’s Talk About the Weather | The correlation between heat and crime suggests the need for more research on shootings in American cities.
As Climate Changes, Southern States Will Suffer More Than Others | As the United States confronts global warming in the decades ahead, not all states will suffer equally. Maine may benefit from milder winters. Florida, by contrast, could face major losses, as deadly heat waves flare up in the summer and rising sea levels eat away at valuable coastal properties.
Intensifying Storms
The Cost of Hurricane Harvey: Only One Recent Storm Comes Close | The graph above, from Sept. 1, 2017, compares more than $200 billion natural disasters since 1980. Note that it does not include major storms that occurred after Hurricane Harvey, including Hurricanes Maria, Irma, Florence and Michael.
The Story of 2018 Was Climate Change | David Leonhardt writes: “From year to year, the number of serious hurricanes fluctuates. But the last few decades show a clear and disturbing trend.”
Contradicting Attitudes
How Americans Think About Climate Change, in Six Maps | This 2017 article reports that Americans overwhelmingly believe global warming is happening and that carbon emissions should be scaled back. But fewer are sure that the changes will harm them personally.
What graphs related to climate change would you want to see?
Students studying climate change might have other data sets in mind they would like to see graphed. For example, perhaps they are interested in retreating glaciers or regional changes in precipitation. You could have students research topics that interest them, find relevant quantitative data and create their own graphs.
We would love to hear about any climate change-related graphs your students create — or about topics you would like to see The Times illustrate in graphs. Post in our comments, or write to us at LNFeedback@nytimes.com — and if your students make some great graphs, be sure to send us photos too since we would love to show them off on our site and on social media.

Rhiana Gunn-Wright, a climate policy director and architect of the Green New Deal, explains the connections between the pandemic and the climate crisis.
“It’s actually easier in a lot of ways to talk about climate change now.”
— Rhiana Gunn-Wright, climate policy director
[In Her Words is available as a newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox.]
Rhiana Gunn-Wright had asthma growing up.
So did many of her neighbors in Englewood, on the South Side of Chicago, where pediatric hospitalization rates for asthma were significantly higher than the rate nationwide in the early 2000s. Ms. Gunn-Wright had so many friends with asthma that she assumed it was a “childhood disease” that all young people had.
Only later in life did she realize it was linked to air pollution in the area, as was shown by research funded by the Environmental Protection Agency.
For some policymakers and advocates, even those organizing global climate strikes, the effects of climate change can feel distant, but Ms. Gunn-Wright, 30, never had that luxury. Her work on environmental justice has always felt personal, tied to the public health problems in her community.
In 2018, Ms. Gunn-Wright was recruited by the progressive think tank New Consensus, which focuses on climate and economic policy, to be a co-author on a paper titled “The Green New Deal.”
It laid out in detail a sweeping platform to fight climate change, and it was the basis of a congressional resolution introduced by Senator Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York. The resolution outlines a 10-year mobilization to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions while creating new jobs and investing in infrastructure, galvanizing “every aspect of American society at a scale not seen since World War II.”
The Green New Deal quickly became a lightning rod among lawmakers. While Republicans cast it as a socialist plan to take away cars and planes, some Democratic presidential candidates embraced parts or all of the framework, and it was credited with encouraging spirited debate on climate policy during the 2020 primary race. Still others critiqued it for its breadth — and many of its specifics, including cost, are still in question.
A year later, the country is in the midst of new crises — a pandemic and an extraordinary economic downturn, amid waves of protest against systemic racism.
In Her Words spoke with Ms. Gunn-Wright about how the coronavirus has made climate issues even more stark, and about the challenges of leading as a Black woman in the predominantly white male world of environmental policy.
The conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.
You’ve been sounding the alarm on climate change for some time. Now the headlines are all about the coronavirus. Has it gotten trickier to focus public attention on climate amid the spread of Covid-19?
In some ways, it’s easier to talk about climate change than when we first came out with the Green New Deal resolution. That’s because the connections between the pandemic and climate crisis are clear, starting with the fact that people of color — Black and Latino folks — are dying at far higher rates from Covid. And there’s already at least one study showing how Covid deaths are correlated with exposure to toxic air pollution.
During the first wave of Covid, the hot spots were in New York, Detroit and New Orleans. That lines up exactly with front-line communities exposed to climate change.
It’s never normal to surround people with toxic air pollution and cause them all sorts of respiratory problems, but before Covid that was the normal drumbeat of injustice. I think Covid has helped break that normalization.
Are you hopeful that some of the positive climate shifts in recent months, like our decreased reliance on air and car travel, will continue after the pandemic?
No, because they’re due to reductions in economic activity and not to policy change. Emissions go down during recessions as a result of decreased economic activity, but they always rebound. You’re going to see them kick into overdrive.
The field of environmental research and policy has long skewed white and male. Columbia University’s earth observatory just appointed its first- female interim director this month. What are some of the hurdles you’ve faced as a Black woman in this line of work?
I had to downplay my Blackness and my own anger. I had to depoliticize myself. Sometimes the connections that I talked about, between equity and the environment, weren’t taken seriously, so I wasn’t taken seriously.
I had at least one white man tell me that if we didn’t mitigate climate change, it would be my fault because the Green New Deal tied in equity and race, and that’s too much, so I will have ruined our changes at climate policy.
How did you respond to that?
I didn’t. Because what climate policy did I interrupt that was happening? There wasn’t anything happening at the federal level. I had a white man write me a multiple-page essay about how we have to tackle the climate crisis because it’s the most urgent thing facing humanity. But racial injustice, he wrote, has always existed, so why do we have to address that now? The way I responded was by doubling down. It became clear to me that part of my work is about elucidating these connections between climate and justice.
How are you working to put climate change and justice at the center of the country’s response to Covid-19?
I’m working on a paper now about green stimulus. It’s spelling out what an economic recovery looks like that is based in climate justice. Climate policy is often thought of as a very long-term thing, so we’re making the case for how it can be used for immediate stimulus and fit into our plans to rebuild the economy.
You’ve been both a political insider and outsider — working for candidates and as a researcher and organizer. Where do you get the most traction?
I sometimes feel that it is easier to do my work outside of the system, because it’s easier to be myself. The work I do is stressful, and the ability to look in the mirror and recognize myself and to act in ways aligned with my values is really important to me.
What parts of yourself have you had to quiet while working inside political institutions?
The way I dress. My aesthetic is “just dropped off my kids and going on a Target run,” but I also have a half-sleeve tattoo and a nose ring. I’ve never seen a person on the inside, like a chief of staff or legislative director, with a sleeve tattoo. I’m very open about calling out white supremacy. And I have mental health issues: I have PTSD, anxiety and depression. I have yet to see a leader, that is someone on the inside, talk about that. The closer you get to the inside, the more the models of leadership and professionalism become exclusionary and focus on a dominant white male leader. I’m at this point in my life where I’m not willing to become a narrower person in order to gain power.
Speaking of people on the inside, Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, hasn’t fully endorsed the Green New Deal, but he did just release a sweeping set of climate policies. You’ve been critical of his new platform. Why is that?
I think it has great elements, but it tries to be transformative while keeping the power relationships that we have in our economy. I think returning power to marginalized communities is very important as part of climate action. For example, if Indigenous communities had the rights that they deserved, if their treaties were respected, we wouldn’t even be thinking about a Dakota Access Pipeline.
Some climate experts say there is a connection between women and environmental action. Why are women more likely to bear the brunt of climate disasters?
Actually, gender is a place where we need to strengthen our analysis. We haven’t done enough thinking about the care economy. Care jobs are green jobs, in the sense that they are low carbon emission jobs. And with Covid, it has become clear how broken our care economy is. On the child care side, it could very well be decimated. Family child care providers are closing and won’t have the support to reopen. With the Green New Deal, we elevated manufacturing jobs and construction, which are important, but it often feels like it’s about saving men’s jobs and the women don’t appear. When there was a gender gap in the original Green New Deal, the Feminist Green New Deal Network stepped in and started thinking through its impact on women. So I’ve been in conversation with them more and learning so much.

Highlight: A Trump administration program  to help states prepare for  natural disasters has become a window into the tortured political language of talking about climate change.

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is about to distribute billions of dollars to coastal states mainly in the South to help steel them against natural disasters worsened by climate change.
But states that qualify must first explain why they need the money. That has triggered linguistic acrobatics as some conservative states submit lengthy, detailed proposals on how they will use the money, while mostly not mentioning climate change.
A 306-page draft proposal from Texas doesn’t use the terms “climate change” or “global warming,” nor does South Carolina’s proposal. Instead, Texas refers to “changing coastal conditions” and South Carolina talks about the “destabilizing effects and unpredictability” of being hit by three major storms in four years, while being barely missed by three other hurricanes.
Louisiana, a state taking some of the most aggressive steps in the nation to prepare for climate change, does include the phrase “climate change” in its proposal in one place, an appendix on the final page.
The federal funding program, devised after the devastating hurricanes and wildfires of 2017, reflects the complicated politics of global warming in the United States, even as the toll of that warming has become difficult to ignore. While officials from both political parties are increasingly forced to confront the effects of climate change, including worsening floods, more powerful storms and greater economic damage, many remain reluctant to talk about the cause.
The $16 billion program, created by Congress and overseen by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is meant to help states better prepare for future natural disasters. It is the first time such funds have been used to prepare for disasters like these that haven’t yet happened, rather than responding to or repairing damage that has already occurred.
The money is distributed according to a formula benefiting states most affected by disasters in 2015, 2016 and 2017. That formula favors Republican-leaning states along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts, which were hit particularly hard during that period.
Texas is in line for more than $4 billion, the most of any state. The next largest sums go to Louisiana ($1.2 billion), Florida ($633 million), North Carolina ($168 million) and South Carolina ($158 million), all of which voted Republican in the 2016 presidential election.
The other states getting funding are West Virginia, Missouri, Georgia and California, the only state getting money that voted Democratic in the presidential race of 2016. California hasn’t yet submitted its proposal, but in the past the state has spoken forcefully about the threat of climate change, in addition to            fighting with the Trump administration to limit greenhouse gas emissions from cars.
Half the money, $8.3 billion, was set aside for Puerto Rico, as well as $774 million for the United States Virgin Islands. The Trump administration has delayed that funding,            citing concerns over corruption and fiscal management.
Not every state has felt compelled to tiptoe around climate change. Florida’s proposal calls it “a key overarching challenge,” while North Carolina pledges to anticipate “how a changing climate, extreme events, ecological degradation and their cascading effects” will affect state residents.
The housing department has itself been careful about how it described the program’s goals. When HUD in August released the rules governing the money, it didn’t use the terms “climate change” and “global warming” but referred to “changing environmental conditions.”
Still, the rule required states that received money to describe their “current and future risks.” And when those risks included flooding — the most costly type of disaster nationwide — states were instructed to account for “continued sea level rise,” which is one consequence of global warming.
A spokeswoman for the housing department did not respond to requests for comment.
Stan Gimont, who as deputy assistant secretary for grant programs at HUD was responsible for the program until he left the department last summer, said the decision not to cite climate change was “a case of picking your battles.”
“When you go out and talk to local officials, there are some who will very actively discuss climate change and sea-level rise, and then there are those who will not,” Mr. Gimont said. “You’ve got to work with both ends of the spectrum. And I think in a lot of ways it’s best to draw a middle road on these things.”
Texas released a draft version of its plan in November. That draft said the state faced “changing coastal conditions,” as well as a future in which both wildfires and extreme heat were expected to increase. In response, the state proposes better flood control, buying and demolishing homes in high-risk areas and giving counties money for their own projects.
But state officials in Texas, where Republicans control the governor’s mansion and both chambers of the Legislature, were silent on what is causing the changes. The report does not cite climate change or global warming, though “climate change” pops up in footnotes citing articles and papers with that phrase in their titles.
Brittany Eck, a spokeswoman for the Texas General Land Office, which produced the proposal, did not respond to questions about the choice of language or the role of climate change in making disasters worse. In an email, she said Texas would distribute the funding based on “accepted scientific research, evidence and historical data to determine projects that provide the greatest value to benefit ratio to protect affected communities from future events.”
Some local politicians in hard-hit areas of Texas are outspoken. Lina Hidalgo, a Democrat and the top elected official in Harris County, which includes Houston and which suffered some of the worst effects of Hurricane Harvey in 2017, said that addressing the effects of climate change was a top issue for her constituents.
“Harris County is Exhibit A for how the climate crisis is impacting the daily lives of residents in Texas,” Ms. Hidalgo said in a statement. “If we’re serious about breaking the cycle of flooding and recovery we have to shift the paradigm on how we do things, and that means putting science above politics.”
In South Carolina, which like Texas is controlled by Republicans in both legislative chambers and the governor’s office, the state’s proposal likewise makes no mention of climate change. It cites sea-level rise once, and only to say that it won’t be addressed.
The state’s flood-reduction efforts “will only address riverine and surface flooding, not storm surge or sea-level rise issues,” according to its proposal.
That is despite the fact that sea levels and storm surges are increasing across the coastal southeastern United States because of climate change, federal scientists wrote in a sweeping 2018 report. The report’s authors noted that Charleston, S.C., broke its record for flooding in 2016, at 50 days, and that “this increase in high-tide flooding is directly tied to sea-level rise.”
Megan Moore, a spokeswoman for South Carolina’s Department of Administration, said by email that the proposal “is designed to increase resilience to and reduce or eliminate long-term risk of loss of life or property based on the repetitive losses sustained in this state.” She did not respond to questions about why the proposal did not address climate change.
One of the states acknowledged that weather conditions were changing and seas were rising, but still mostly avoided the term climate change. Louisiana, whose location at the mouth of the Mississippi River makes it one of the states most threatened by climate change, intends to use the $1.2 billion it will receive to better map and prepare for future flooding — a major peril for countless low-lying areas — said Pat Forbes, executive director of the state’s Office of Community Development, which is managing the money.
“We realize we’ve got to get better, because it’s going to get worse,” Mr. Forbes said.
The state, where both the House and Senate are controlled by Republicans but the governor is a Democrat, submitted a proposal that makes references to climate change, noting that the risks of flooding “will continue to escalate in a warming world.”
Still, the 91-page report uses the phrase “climate change” only once, at the end of an appendix on its final page.
Mr. Forbes called climate change “not that important a thing for an action plan,” and said that mostly leaving the phrase out of the document was not intentional. He said the purpose of the proposal was to demonstrate to the federal government that Louisiana knows what it wants to do with the money.
“Our governor has acknowledged on multiple occasions that we expect the flooding to be more frequent and worse in the future, not better,” Mr. Forbes said. “So we’ve got to have an adaptive process here that constantly makes us safer.”
Other states used their proposals to emphasize the centrality of climate change to the risks they face. “Climate change is a key overarching challenge which threatens to compound the extent and effects of hazards,” wrote officials in Florida, where Republicans control both legislative chambers and the governor’s office.
In North Carolina, which has a Democratic governor and a Republican-controlled Legislature, the proposal argued that the state was trying to anticipate “how a changing climate, extreme events, ecological degradation and their cascading effects will impact the needs of North Carolina’s vulnerable populations.”
Shana Udvardy, a climate resilience analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the failure to confront global warming made it more important for governments to at least call the problem by its name.
“We really need every single state, local and federal official to speak clearly,” Ms. Udvardy said. “The polls indicate that the majority of Americans understand that climate change is happening here and now.”
Others were more sympathetic. Marion McFadden, who preceded Mr. Gimont as head of disaster-recovery grants at HUD during the Obama administration, said the department was responding to the political realities in conservative states. She described the $16 billion grant program as “all about climate change,” but said some states would sooner refuse the money than admit that global warming is real.
“HUD is requiring them to be explicit about everything other than the concept that climate change is responsible,” said Ms. McFadden, who is now senior vice president for public policy at Enterprise Community Partners, which worked with states to meet the program’s requirements. Insistence on saying the words raises the risk “that they may walk away.”

August besieged California with a heat unseen in generations. A surge in air-conditioning broke the state's electrical grid, leaving a population already ravaged by the coronavirus to work remotely by the dim light of their cellphones. By midmonth, the state had recorded possibly the hottest temperature ever measured on earth -- 130 degrees in Death Valley -- and an otherworldly storm of lightning had cracked open the sky. From Santa Cruz to Lake Tahoe, thousands of bolts of electricity exploded down onto withered grasslands and forests, some of them already hollowed out by climate-driven infestations of beetles and kiln-dried by the worst five-year drought on record. Soon, California was on fire.
Over the next two weeks, 900 blazes incinerated six times as much land as all the state's 2019 wildfires combined, forcing 100,000 people from their homes. Three of the largest fires in history burned simultaneously in a ring around the San Francisco Bay Area. Another fire burned just 12 miles from my home in Marin County. I watched as towering plumes of smoke billowed from distant hills in all directions and air tankers crisscrossed the skies. Like many Californians, I spent those weeks worrying about what might happen next, wondering how long it would be before an inferno of 60-foot flames swept up the steep, grassy hillside on its way toward my own house, rehearsing in my mind what my family would do to escape. 
  But I also had a longer-term question, about what would happen once this unprecedented fire season ended. Was it finally time to leave for good?
  I had an unusual perspective on the matter. For two years, I have been studying how climate change will influence global migration. My sense was that of all the devastating consequences of a warming planet -- changing landscapes, pandemics, mass extinctions -- the potential movement of hundreds of millions of climate refugees across the planet stands to be among the most important. I traveled across four countries to witness how rising temperatures were driving climate refugees away from some of the poorest and hottest parts of the world. I had also helped create an enormous computer simulation to analyze how global demographics might shift, and now I was working on a data-mapping project about migration here in the United States.
  So it was with some sense of recognition that I faced the fires these last few weeks. In recent years, summer has brought a season of fear to California, with ever-worsening wildfires closing in. But this year felt different. The hopelessness of the pattern was now clear, and the pandemic had already uprooted so many Americans. Relocation no longer seemed like such a distant prospect. Like the subjects of my reporting, climate change had found me, its indiscriminate forces erasing all semblance of normalcy. Suddenly I had to ask myself the very question I'd been asking others: Was it time to move?
  I am far from the only American facing such questions. This summer has seen more fires, more heat, more storms -- all of it making life increasingly untenable in larger areas of the nation. Already, droughts regularly threaten food crops across the West, while destructive floods inundate towns and fields from the Dakotas to Maryland, collapsing dams in Michigan and raising the shorelines of the Great Lakes. Rising seas and increasingly violent hurricanes are making thousands of miles of American shoreline nearly uninhabitable. As California burned, Hurricane Laura pounded the Louisiana coast with 150-mile-an-hour winds, killing at least 25 people; it was the 12th named storm to form by that point in 2020, another record. Phoenix, meanwhile, endured 53 days of 110-degree heat -- 20 more days than the previous record.
  For years, Americans have avoided confronting these changes in their own backyards. The decisions we make about where to live are distorted not just by politics that play down climate risks, but also by expensive subsidies and incentives aimed at defying nature. In much of the developing world, vulnerable people will attempt to flee the emerging perils of global warming, seeking cooler temperatures, more fresh water and safety. But here in the United States, people have largely gravitated toward environmental danger, building along coastlines from New Jersey to Florida and settling across the cloudless deserts of the Southwest.
  I wanted to know if this was beginning to change. Might Americans finally be waking up to how climate is about to transform their lives? And if so -- if a great domestic relocation might be in the offing -- was it possible to project where we might go? To answer these questions, I interviewed more than four dozen experts: economists and demographers, climate scientists and insurance executives, architects and urban planners, and I mapped out the danger zones that will close in on Americans over the next 30 years. The maps for the first time combined exclusive climate data from the Rhodium Group, an independent data-analytics firm; wildfire projections modeled by United States Forest Service researchers and others; and data about America's shifting climate niches, an evolution of work first published by The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences last spring. (A detailed analysis of the maps is online at projects.propublica.org/climate-migration.)
  What I found was a nation on the cusp of a great transformation. Across the United States, some 162 million people -- nearly one in two -- will most likely experience a decline in the quality of their environment, namely more heat and less water. For 93 million of them, the changes could be particularly severe, and by 2070, our analysis suggests, if carbon emissions rise at extreme levels, at least four million Americans could find themselves living at the fringe, in places decidedly outside the ideal niche for human life. The cost of resisting the new climate reality is mounting. Florida officials have already acknowledged that defending some roadways against the sea will be unaffordable. And the nation's federal flood-insurance program is for the first time requiring that some of its payouts be used to retreat from climate threats across the country. It will soon prove too expensive to maintain the status quo.
  Then what? One influential 2018 study, published in The Journal of the Association of Environmental and Resource Economists, suggests that one in 12 Americans in the Southern half of the country will move toward California, the Mountain West or the Northwest over the next 45 years because of climate influences alone. Such a shift in population is likely to increase poverty and widen the gulf between the rich and the poor. It will accelerate rapid, perhaps chaotic, urbanization of cities ill-equipped for the burden, testing their capacity to provide basic services and amplifying existing inequities. It will eat away at prosperity, dealing repeated economic blows to coastal, rural and Southern regions, which could in turn push entire communities to the brink of collapse. This process has already begun in rural Louisiana and coastal Georgia, where low-income and Black and Indigenous communities face environmental change on top of poor health and extreme poverty. Mobility itself, global-migration experts point out, is often a reflection of relative wealth, and as some move, many others will be left behind. Those who stay risk becoming trapped as the land and the society around them ceases to offer any more support.
  There are signs that the message is breaking through. Half of Americans now rank climate as a top political priority, up from roughly one-third in 2016, and three out of four now describe climate change as either ''a crisis'' or ''a major problem.'' This year, Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa, where tens of thousands of acres of farmland flooded in 2019, ranked climate second only to health care as an issue. A poll by researchers at Yale and George Mason Universities found that even Republicans' views are shifting: One in three now think climate change should be declared a national emergency.
  Policymakers, having left America unprepared for what's next, now face brutal choices about which communities to save -- often at exorbitant costs -- and which to sacrifice. Their decisions will almost inevitably make the nation more divided, with those worst off relegated to a nightmare future in which they are left to fend for themselves. Nor will these disruptions wait for the worst environmental changes to occur. The wave begins when individual perception of risk starts to shift, when the environmental threat reaches past the least fortunate and rattles the physical and financial security of broader, wealthier parts of the population. It begins when even places like California's suburbs are no longer safe.
  It has already begun.
  Let's start with some basics. Across the country, it's going to get hot. Buffalo may feel in a few decades like Tempe, Ariz., does today, and Tempe itself will sustain 100-degree average summer temperatures by the end of the century. Extreme humidity from New Orleans to northern Wisconsin will make summers increasingly unbearable, turning otherwise seemingly survivable heat waves into debilitating health threats. Fresh water will also be in short supply, not only in the West but also in places like Florida, Georgia and Alabama, where droughts now regularly wither cotton fields. By 2040, according to federal government projections, extreme water shortages will be nearly ubiquitous west of Missouri. The Memphis Sands Aquifer, a crucial water supply for Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas and Louisiana, is already overdrawn by hundreds of millions of gallons a day. Much of the Ogallala Aquifer -- which supplies nearly a third of the nation's irrigation groundwater -- could be gone by the end of the century.
  It can be difficult to see the challenges clearly because so many factors are in play. At least 28 million Americans are likely to face megafires like the ones we are now seeing in California, in places like Texas and Florida and Georgia. At the same time, 100 million Americans -- largely in the Mississippi River Basin from Louisiana to Wisconsin -- will increasingly face humidity so extreme that working outside or playing school sports could cause heatstroke. Crop yields will be decimated from Texas to Alabama and all the way north through Oklahoma and Kansas and into Nebraska.
  The challenges are so widespread and so interrelated that Americans seeking to flee one could well run into another. I live on a hilltop, 400 feet above sea level, and my home will never be touched by rising waters. But by the end of this century, if the more extreme projections of eight to 10 feet of sea-level rise come to fruition, the shoreline of San Francisco Bay will move three miles closer to my house, as it subsumes some 166 square miles of land, including a high school, a new county hospital and the store where I buy groceries. The freeway to San Francisco will need to be raised, and to the east, a new bridge will be required to connect the community of Point Richmond to the city of Berkeley. The Latino, Asian and Black communities who live in the most-vulnerable low-lying districts will be displaced first, but research from Mathew Hauer, a sociologist at Florida State University who published some of the first modeling of American climate migration in the journal Nature Climate Change in 2017, suggests that the toll will eventually be far more widespread: Nearly one in three people here in Marin County will leave, part of the roughly 700,000 who his models suggest may abandon the broader Bay Area as a result of sea-level rise alone.
  From Maine to North Carolina to Texas, rising sea levels are not just chewing up shorelines but also raising rivers and swamping the subterranean infrastructure of coastal communities, making a stable life there all but impossible. Coastal high points will be cut off from roadways, amenities and escape routes, and even far inland, saltwater will seep into underground drinking-water supplies. Eight of the nation's 20 largest metropolitan areas -- Miami, New York and Boston among them -- will be profoundly altered, indirectly affecting some 50 million people. Imagine large concrete walls separating Fort Lauderdale condominiums from a beachless waterfront, or dozens of new bridges connecting the islands of Philadelphia. Not every city can spend $100 billion on a sea wall, as New York most likely will. Barrier islands? Rural areas along the coast without a strong tax base? They are likely, in the long term, unsalvageable.
  In all, Hauer projects that 13 million Americans will be forced to move away from submerged coastlines. Add to that the people contending with wildfires and other risks, and the number of Americans who might move -- though difficult to predict precisely -- could easily be tens of millions larger. Even 13 million climate migrants, though, would rank as the largest migration in North American history. The Great Migration -- of six million Black Americans out of the South from 1916 to 1970 -- transformed almost everything we know about America, from the fate of its labor movement to the shape of its cities to the sound of its music. What would it look like when twice that many people moved? What might change?
  Americans have been conditioned not to respond to geographical climate threats as people in the rest of the world do. It is natural that rural Guatemalans or subsistence farmers in Kenya, facing drought or scorching heat, would seek out someplace more stable and resilient. Even a subtle environmental change -- a dry well, say -- can mean life or death, and without money to address the problem, migration is often simply a question of survival.
  By comparison, Americans are richer, often much richer, and more insulated from the shocks of climate change. They are distanced from the food and water sources they depend on, and they are part of a culture that sees every problem as capable of being solved by money. So even as the average flow of the Colorado River -- the water supply for 40 million Western Americans and the backbone of the nation's vegetable and cattle farming -- has declined for most of the last 33 years, the population of Nevada has doubled. At the same time, more than 1.5 million people have moved to the Phoenix metro area, despite its dependence on that same river (and the fact that temperatures there now regularly hit 115 degrees). Since Hurricane Andrew devastated Florida in 1992 -- and even as that state has become a global example of the threat of sea-level rise -- more than five million people have moved to Florida's shorelines, driving a historic boom in building and real estate.
  Similar patterns are evident across the country. Census data show us how Americans move: toward heat, toward coastlines, toward drought, regardless of evidence of increasing storms and flooding and other disasters.
  The sense that money and technology can overcome nature has emboldened Americans. Where money and technology fail, though, it inevitably falls to government policies -- and government subsidies -- to pick up the slack. Thanks to federally subsidized canals, for example, water in part of the Desert Southwest costs less than it does in Philadelphia. The federal National Flood Insurance Program has paid to rebuild houses that have flooded six times over in the same spot. And federal agriculture aid withholds subsidies from farmers who switch to drought-resistant crops, while paying growers to replant the same ones that failed. Farmers, seed manufacturers, real estate developers and a few homeowners benefit, at least momentarily, but the gap between what the climate can destroy and what money can replace is growing.
  Perhaps no market force has proved more influential -- and more misguided -- than the nation's property-insurance system. From state to state, readily available and affordable policies have made it attractive to buy or replace homes even where they are at high risk of disasters, systematically obscuring the reality of the climate threat and fooling many Americans into thinking that their decisions are safer than they actually are. Part of the problem is that most policies look only 12 months into the future, ignoring long-term trends even as insurance availability influences development and drives people's long-term decision-making.
  Even where insurers have tried to withdraw policies or raise rates to reduce climate-related liabilities, state regulators have forced them to provide affordable coverage anyway, simply subsidizing the cost of underwriting such a risky policy or, in some cases, offering it themselves. The regulations -- called Fair Access to Insurance Requirements -- are justified by developers and local politicians alike as economic lifeboats ''of last resort'' in regions where climate change threatens to interrupt economic growth. While they do protect some entrenched and vulnerable communities, the laws also satisfy the demand of wealthier homeowners who still want to be able to buy insurance.
  At least 30 states, including Louisiana, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Texas, have developed so-called FAIR plans, and today they serve as a market backstop in the places facing the highest risks of climate-driven disasters, including coastal flooding, hurricanes and wildfires.
  In an era of climate change, though, such policies amount to a sort of shell game, meant to keep growth going even when other obvious signs and scientific research suggest that it should stop.
  That's what happened in Florida. Hurricane Andrew reduced parts of cities to landfill and cost insurers nearly $16 billion in payouts. Many insurance companies, recognizing the likelihood that it would happen again, declined to renew policies and left the state. So the Florida Legislature created a state-run company to insure properties itself, preventing both an exodus and an economic collapse by essentially pretending that the climate vulnerabilities didn't exist.
  As a result, Florida's taxpayers by 2012 had assumed liabilities worth some $511 billion -- more than seven times the state's total budget -- as the value of coastal property topped $2.8 trillion. Another direct hurricane risked bankrupting the state. Florida, concerned that it had taken on too much risk, has since scaled back its self-insurance plan. But the development that resulted is still in place.
  On a sweltering afternoon last October, with the skies above me full of wildfire smoke, I called Jesse Keenan, an urban-planning and climate-change specialist then at Harvard's Graduate School of Design, who advises the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission on market hazards from climate change. Keenan, who is now an associate professor of real estate at Tulane University's School of Architecture, had been in the news last year for projecting where people might move to -- suggesting that Duluth, Minn., for instance, should brace for a coming real estate boom as climate migrants move north. But like other scientists I'd spoken with, Keenan had been reluctant to draw conclusions about where these migrants would be driven from.
  Last fall, though, as the previous round of fires ravaged California, his phone began to ring, with private-equity investors and bankers all looking for his read on the state's future. Their interest suggested a growing investor-grade nervousness about swiftly mounting environmental risk in the hottest real estate markets in the country. It's an early sign, he told me, that the momentum is about to switch directions. ''And once this flips,'' he added, ''it's likely to flip very quickly.''
  In fact, the correction -- a newfound respect for the destructive power of nature, coupled with a sudden disavowal of Americans' appetite for reckless development -- had begun two years earlier, when a frightening surge in disasters offered a jolting preview of how the climate crisis was changing the rules.
  On October 9, 2017, a wildfire blazed through the suburban blue-collar neighborhood of Coffey Park in Santa Rosa, Calif., virtually in my own backyard. I awoke to learn that more than 1,800 buildings were reduced to ashes, less than 35 miles from where I slept. Inchlong cinders had piled on my windowsills like falling snow.
  The Tubbs Fire, as it was called, shouldn't have been possible. Coffey Park is surrounded not by vegetation but by concrete and malls and freeways. So insurers had rated it as ''basically zero risk,'' according to Kevin Van Leer, then a risk modeler from the global insurance liability firm Risk Management Solutions. (He now does similar work for Cape Analytics.) But Van Leer, who had spent seven years picking through the debris left by disasters to understand how insurers could anticipate -- and price -- the risk of their happening again, had begun to see other ''impossible'' fires. After a 2016 fire tornado ripped through northern Canada and a firestorm consumed Gatlinburg, Tenn., he said, ''alarm bells started going off'' for the insurance industry.
  What Van Leer saw when he walked through Coffey Park a week after the Tubbs Fire changed the way he would model and project fire risk forever. Typically, fire would spread along the ground, burning maybe 50 percent of structures. In Santa Rosa, more than 90 percent had been leveled. ''The destruction was complete,'' he told me. Van Leer determined that the fire had jumped through the forest canopy, spawning 70-mile-per-hour winds that kicked a storm of embers into the modest homes of Coffey Park, which burned at an acre a second as homes ignited spontaneously from the radiant heat. It was the kind of thing that might never have been possible if California's autumn winds weren't getting fiercer and drier every year, colliding with intensifying, climate-driven heat and ever-expanding development. ''It's hard to forecast something you've never seen before,'' he said.
  For me, the awakening to imminent climate risk came with California's rolling power blackouts last fall -- an effort to pre-emptively avoid the risk of a live wire sparking a fire -- which showed me that all my notional perspective about climate risk and my own life choices were on a collision course. After the first one, all the food in our refrigerator was lost. When power was interrupted six more times in three weeks, we stopped trying to keep it stocked. All around us, small fires burned. Thick smoke produced fits of coughing. Then, as now, I packed an ax and a go-bag in my car, ready to evacuate. As former Gov. Jerry Brown said, it was beginning to feel like the ''new abnormal.''
  It was no surprise, then, that California's property insurers -- having watched 26 years' worth of profits dissolve over 24 months -- began dropping policies, or that California's insurance commissioner, trying to slow the slide, placed a moratorium on insurance cancellations for parts of the state in 2020. In February, the Legislature introduced a bill compelling California to, in the words of one consumer advocacy group, ''follow the lead of Florida'' by mandating that insurance remain available, in this case with a requirement that homeowners first harden their properties against fire. At the same time, participation in California's FAIR plan for catastrophic fires has grown by at least 180 percent since 2015, and in Santa Rosa, houses are being rebuilt in the very same wildfire-vulnerable zones that proved so deadly in 2017. Given that a new study projects a 20 percent increase in extreme-fire-weather days by 2035, such practices suggest a special form of climate negligence.
  It's only a matter of time before homeowners begin to recognize the unsustainability of this approach. Market shock, when driven by the sort of cultural awakening to risk that Keenan observes, can strike a neighborhood like an infectious disease, with fear spreading doubt -- and devaluation -- from door to door. It happened that way in the foreclosure crisis.
  Keenan calls the practice of drawing arbitrary lending boundaries around areas of perceived environmental risk ''bluelining,'' and indeed many of the neighborhoods that banks are bluelining are the same as the ones that were hit by the racist redlining practice in days past. This summer, climate-data analysts at the First Street Foundation released maps showing that 70 percent more buildings in the United States were vulnerable to flood risk than previously thought; most of the underestimated risk was in low-income neighborhoods.
  Such neighborhoods see little in the way of flood-prevention investment. My Bay Area neighborhood, on the other hand, has benefited from consistent investment in efforts to defend it against the ravages of climate change. That questions of livability had reached me, here, were testament to Keenan's belief that the bluelining phenomenon will eventually affect large majorities of equity-holding middle-class Americans too, with broad implications for the overall economy, starting in the nation's largest state.
  Under the radar, a new class of dangerous debt -- climate-distressed mortgage loans -- might already be threatening the financial system. Lending data analyzed by Keenan and his co-author, Jacob Bradt, for a study published in the journal Climatic Change in June shows that small banks are liberally making loans on environmentally threatened homes, but then quickly passing them along to federal mortgage backers. At the same time, they have all but stopped lending money for the higher-end properties worth too much for the government to accept, suggesting that the banks are knowingly passing climate liabilities along to taxpayers as stranded assets.
  Once home values begin a one-way plummet, it's easy for economists to see how entire communities spin out of control. The tax base declines and the school system and civic services falter, creating a negative feedback loop that pushes more people to leave. Rising insurance costs and the perception of risk force credit-rating agencies to downgrade towns, making it more difficult for them to issue bonds and plug the springing financial leaks. Local banks, meanwhile, keep securitizing their mortgage debt, sloughing off their own liabilities.
  Keenan, though, had a bigger point: All the structural disincentives that had built Americans' irrational response to the climate risk were now reaching their logical endpoint. A pandemic-induced economic collapse will only heighten the vulnerabilities and speed the transition, reducing to nothing whatever thin margin of financial protection has kept people in place. Until now, the market mechanisms had essentially socialized the consequences of high-risk development. But as the costs rise -- and the insurers quit, and the bankers divest, and the farm subsidies prove too wasteful, and so on -- the full weight of responsibility will fall on individual people.
  And that's when the real migration might begin.
  As I spoke with Keenan last year, I looked out my own kitchen window onto hillsides of parkland, singed brown by months of dry summer heat. This was precisely the land that my utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, had three times identified as such an imperiled tinderbox that it had to shut off power to avoid fire. It was precisely the kind of wildland-urban interface that all the studies I read blamed for heightening Californians' exposure to climate risks. I mentioned this on the phone and then asked Keenan, ''Should I be selling my house and getting -- ''
  He cut me off: ''Yes.''
  Americans have dealt with climate disaster before. The Dust Bowl started after the federal government expanded the Homestead Act to offer more land to settlers willing to work the marginal soil of the Great Plains. Millions took up the invitation, replacing hardy prairie grass with thirsty crops like corn, wheat and cotton. Then, entirely predictably, came the drought. From 1929 to 1934, crop yields across Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri plunged by 60 percent, leaving farmers destitute and exposing the now-barren topsoil to dry winds and soaring temperatures. The resulting dust storms, some of them taller than skyscrapers, buried homes whole and blew as far east as Washington. The disaster propelled an exodus of some 2.5 million people, mostly to the West, where newcomers -- ''Okies'' not just from Oklahoma but also Texas, Arkansas and Missouri -- unsettled communities and competed for jobs. Colorado tried to seal its border from the climate refugees; in California, they were funneled into squalid shanty towns. Only after the migrants settled and had years to claw back a decent life did some towns bounce back stronger.
  The places migrants left behind never fully recovered. Eighty years later, Dust Bowl towns still have slower economic growth and lower per capita income than the rest of the country. Dust Bowl survivors and their children are less likely to go to college and more likely to live in poverty. Climatic change made them poor, and it has kept them poor ever since.
  A Dust Bowl event will most likely happen again. The Great Plains states today provide nearly half of the nation's wheat, sorghum and cattle and much of its corn; the farmers and ranchers there export that food to Africa, South America and Asia. Crop yields, though, will drop sharply with every degree of warming. By 2050, researchers at the University of Chicago and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies found, Dust Bowl-era yields will be the norm, even as demand for scarce water jumps by as much as 20 percent. Another extreme drought would drive near-total crop losses worse than the Dust Bowl, kneecapping the broader economy. At that point, the authors write, ''abandonment is one option.''
  Projections are inherently imprecise, but the gradual changes to America's cropland -- plus the steady baking and burning and flooding -- suggest that we are already witnessing a slower-forming but much larger replay of the Dust Bowl that will destroy more than just crops. In 2017, Solomon Hsiang, a climate economist at the University of California, Berkeley, led an analysis of the economic impact of climate-driven changes like rising mortality and rising energy costs, finding that the poorest counties in the United States -- mostly across the South and the Southwest -- will in some extreme cases face damages equal to more than a third of their gross domestic products. The 2018 National Climate Assessment also warns that the U.S. economy over all could contract by 10 percent.
  That kind of loss typically drives people toward cities, and researchers expect that trend to continue after the Covid-19 pandemic ends. In 1950, less than 65 percent of Americans lived in cities. By 2050, only 10 percent will live outside them, in part because of climatic change. By 2100, Hauer estimates, Atlanta, Orlando, Houston and Austin could each receive more than a quarter million new residents as a result of sea-level displacement alone, meaning it may be those cities -- not the places that empty out -- that wind up bearing the brunt of America's reshuffling. The World Bank warns that fast-moving climate urbanization leads to rising unemployment, competition for services and deepening poverty.
  So what will happen to Atlanta -- a metro area of 5.8 million people that may lose its water supply to drought and that our data also shows will face an increase in heat-driven wildfires? Hauer estimates that hundreds of thousands of climate refugees will move into the city by 2100, swelling its population and stressing its infrastructure. Atlanta -- where poor transportation and water systems contributed to the state's C+ infrastructure grade last year -- already suffers greater income inequality than any other large American city, making it a virtual tinderbox for social conflict. One in 10 households earns less than $10,000 a year, and rings of extreme poverty are growing on its outskirts even as the city center grows wealthier.
  Atlanta has started bolstering its defenses against climate change, but in some cases this has only exacerbated divisions. When the city converted an old Westside rock quarry into a reservoir, part of a larger greenbelt to expand parkland, clean the air and protect against drought, the project also fueled rapid upscale growth, driving the poorest Black communities further into impoverished suburbs. That Atlanta hasn't ''fully grappled with'' such challenges now, says Na'Taki Osborne Jelks, chair of the West Atlanta Watershed Alliance, means that with more people and higher temperatures, ''the city might be pushed to what's manageable.''
  So might Philadelphia, Chicago, Washington, Boston and other cities with long-neglected systems suddenly pressed to expand under increasingly adverse conditions.
  Once you accept that climate change is fast making large parts of the United States nearly uninhabitable, the future looks like this: With time, the bottom half of the country grows inhospitable, dangerous and hot. Something like a tenth of the people who live in the South and the Southwest -- from South Carolina to Alabama to Texas to Southern California -- decide to move north in search of a better economy and a more temperate environment. Those who stay behind are disproportionately poor and elderly.
  In these places, heat alone will cause as many as 80 additional deaths per 100,000 people -- the nation's opioid crisis, by comparison, produces 15 additional deaths per 100,000. The most affected people, meanwhile, will pay 20 percent more for energy, and their crops will yield half as much food or in some cases virtually none at all. That collective burden will drag down regional incomes by roughly 10 percent, amounting to one of the largest transfers of wealth in American history, as people who live farther north will benefit from that change and see their fortunes rise.
  The millions of people moving north will mostly head to the cities of the Northeast and Northwest, which will see their populations grow by roughly 10 percent, according to one model. Once-chilly places like Minnesota and Michigan and Vermont will become more temperate, verdant and inviting. Vast regions will prosper; just as Hsiang's research forecast that Southern counties could see a tenth of their economy dry up, he projects that others as far as North Dakota and Minnesota will enjoy a corresponding expansion. Cities like Detroit, Rochester, Buffalo and Milwaukee will see a renaissance, with their excess capacity in infrastructure, water supplies and highways once again put to good use. One day, it's possible that a high-speed rail line could race across the Dakotas, through Idaho's up-and-coming wine country and the country's new breadbasket along the Canadian border, to the megalopolis of Seattle, which by then has nearly merged with Vancouver to its north.
  Sitting in my own backyard one afternoon this summer, my wife and I talked through the implications of this looming American future. The facts were clear and increasingly foreboding. Yet there were so many intangibles -- a love of nature, the busy pace of life, the high cost of moving -- that conspired to keep us from leaving. Nobody wants to migrate away from home, even when an inexorable danger is inching ever closer. They do it when there is no longer any other choice.

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is about to distribute billions of dollars to coastal states mainly in the South to help steel them against natural disasters worsened by climate change. 
  But states that qualify must first explain why they need the money. That has triggered linguistic acrobatics as some conservative states submit lengthy, detailed proposals on how they will use the money, while mostly not mentioning climate change.
  A 306-page draft proposal from Texas doesn't use the terms ''climate change'' or ''global warming,'' nor does South Carolina's proposal. Instead, Texas refers to ''changing coastal conditions'' and South Carolina talks about the ''destabilizing effects and unpredictability'' of being hit by three major storms in four years, while being barely missed by three other hurricanes.
  Louisiana, a state taking some of the most aggressive steps in the nation to prepare for climate change, does include the phrase ''climate change'' in its proposal in one place, an appendix on the final page.
  The federal funding program, devised after the devastating hurricanes and wildfires of 2017, reflects the complicated politics of global warming in the United States, even as the toll of that warming has become difficult to ignore. While officials from both political parties are increasingly forced to confront the effects of climate change, including worsening floods, more powerful storms and greater economic damage, many remain reluctant to talk about the cause.
  The $16 billion program, created by Congress and overseen by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is meant to help states better prepare for future natural disasters. It is the first time such funds have been used to prepare for disasters like these that haven't yet happened, rather than responding to or repairing damage that has already occurred.
  The money is distributed according to a formula benefiting states most affected by disasters in 2015, 2016 and 2017. That formula favors Republican-leaning states along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts, which were hit particularly hard during that period.
  Texas is in line for more than $4 billion, the most of any state. The next largest sums go to Louisiana ($1.2 billion), Florida ($633 million), North Carolina ($168 million) and South Carolina ($158 million), all of which voted Republican in the 2016 presidential election.
  The other states getting funding are West Virginia, Missouri, Georgia and California, the only state getting money that voted Democratic in the presidential race of 2016. California hasn't yet submitted its proposal, but in the past the state has spoken forcefully about the threat of climate change, in addition to fighting with the Trump administration to limit greenhouse gas emissions from cars.
  Half the money, $8.3 billion, was set aside for Puerto Rico, as well as $774 million for the United States Virgin Islands. The Trump administration has delayed that funding, citing concerns over corruption and fiscal management.
  Not every state has felt compelled to tiptoe around climate change. Florida's proposal calls it ''a key overarching challenge,'' while North Carolina pledges to anticipate ''how a changing climate, extreme events, ecological degradation and their cascading effects'' will affect state residents.
  The housing department has itself been careful about how it described the program's goals. When HUD in August released the rules governing the money, it didn't use the terms ''climate change'' and ''global warming'' but referred to ''changing environmental conditions.''
  Still, the rule required states that received money to describe their ''current and future risks.'' And when those risks included flooding -- the most costly type of disaster nationwide -- states were instructed to account for ''continued sea level rise,'' which is one consequence of global warming.
  A spokeswoman for the housing department did not respond to requests for comment.
  Stan Gimont, who as deputy assistant secretary for grant programs at HUD was responsible for the program until he left the department last summer, said the decision not to cite climate change was ''a case of picking your battles.''
  ''When you go out and talk to local officials, there are some who will very actively discuss climate change and sea-level rise, and then there are those who will not,'' Mr. Gimont said. ''You've got to work with both ends of the spectrum. And I think in a lot of ways it's best to draw a middle road on these things.''
  Texas released a draft version of its plan in November. That draft said the state faced ''changing coastal conditions,'' as well as a future in which both wildfires and extreme heat were expected to increase. In response, the state proposes better flood control, buying and demolishing homes in high-risk areas and giving counties money for their own projects.
  But state officials in Texas, where Republicans control the governor's mansion and both chambers of the Legislature, were silent on what is causing the changes. The report does not cite climate change or global warming, though ''climate change'' pops up in footnotes citing articles and papers with that phrase in their titles.
  Brittany Eck, a spokeswoman for the Texas General Land Office, which produced the proposal, did not respond to questions about the choice of language or the role of climate change in making disasters worse. In an email, she said Texas would distribute the funding based on ''accepted scientific research, evidence and historical data to determine projects that provide the greatest value to benefit ratio to protect affected communities from future events.''
  Some local politicians in hard-hit areas of Texas are outspoken. Lina Hidalgo, a Democrat and the top elected official in Harris County, which includes Houston and which suffered some of the worst effects of Hurricane Harvey in 2017, said that addressing the effects of climate change was a top issue for her constituents.
  ''Harris County is Exhibit A for how the climate crisis is impacting the daily lives of residents in Texas,'' Ms. Hidalgo said in a statement. ''If we're serious about breaking the cycle of flooding and recovery we have to shift the paradigm on how we do things, and that means putting science above politics.''
  In South Carolina, which like Texas is controlled by Republicans in both legislative chambers and the governor's office, the state's proposal likewise makes no mention of climate change. It cites sea-level rise once, and only to say that it won't be addressed.
  The state's flood-reduction efforts ''will only address riverine and surface flooding, not storm surge or sea-level rise issues,'' according to its proposal.
  That is despite the fact that sea levels and storm surges are increasing across the coastal southeastern United States because of climate change, federal scientists wrote in a sweeping 2018 report. The report's authors noted that Charleston, S.C., broke its record for flooding in 2016, at 50 days, and that ''this increase in high-tide flooding is directly tied to sea-level rise.''
  Megan Moore, a spokeswoman for South Carolina's Department of Administration, said by email that the proposal ''is designed to increase resilience to and reduce or eliminate long-term risk of loss of life or property based on the repetitive losses sustained in this state.'' She did not respond to questions about why the proposal did not address climate change.
  One of the states acknowledged that weather conditions were changing and seas were rising, but still mostly avoided the term climate change. Louisiana, whose location at the mouth of the Mississippi River makes it one of the states most threatened by climate change, intends to use the $1.2 billion it will receive to better map and prepare for future flooding -- a major peril for countless low-lying areas -- said Pat Forbes, executive director of the state's Office of Community Development, which is managing the money.
  ''We realize we've got to get better, because it's going to get worse,'' Mr. Forbes said.
  The state, where both the House and Senate are controlled by Republicans but the governor is a Democrat, submitted a proposal that makes references to climate change, noting that the risks of flooding ''will continue to escalate in a warming world.''
  Still, the 91-page report uses the phrase ''climate change'' only once, at the end of an appendix on its final page.
  Mr. Forbes called climate change ''not that important a thing for an action plan,'' and said that mostly leaving the phrase out of the document was not intentional. He said the purpose of the proposal was to demonstrate to the federal government that Louisiana knows what it wants to do with the money.
  ''Our governor has acknowledged on multiple occasions that we expect the flooding to be more frequent and worse in the future, not better,'' Mr. Forbes said. ''So we've got to have an adaptive process here that constantly makes us safer.''
  Other states used their proposals to emphasize the centrality of climate change to the risks they face. ''Climate change is a key overarching challenge which threatens to compound the extent and effects of hazards,'' wrote officials in Florida, where Republicans control both legislative chambers and the governor's office.
  In North Carolina, which has a Democratic governor and a Republican-controlled Legislature, the proposal argued that the state was trying to anticipate ''how a changing climate, extreme events, ecological degradation and their cascading effects will impact the needs of North Carolina's vulnerable populations.''
  Shana Udvardy, a climate resilience analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the failure to confront global warming made it more important for governments to at least call the problem by its name.
  ''We really need every single state, local and federal official to speak clearly,'' Ms. Udvardy said. ''The polls indicate that the majority of Americans understand that climate change is happening here and now.''
  Others were more sympathetic. Marion McFadden, who preceded Mr. Gimont as head of disaster-recovery grants at HUD during the Obama administration, said the department was responding to the political realities in conservative states. She described the $16 billion grant program as ''all about climate change,'' but said some states would sooner refuse the money than admit that global warming is real.
  ''HUD is requiring them to be explicit about everything other than the concept that climate change is responsible,'' said Ms. McFadden, who is now senior vice president for public policy at Enterprise Community Partners, which worked with states to meet the program's requirements. Insistence on saying the words raises the risk ''that they may walk away.''

Scientists say that climate change, which has also contributed to the wildfires on the West Coast, helped intensify a storm that is unleashing a deluge in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi.
[Follow our live Hurricane Sally updates and our map tracker.]
BAYOU LA BATRE, Ala. — Hurricane Sally parked itself over the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, churning slowly and lumbering at a sluggish pace toward land, representing a climate change reality that has made many hurricanes wetter, slower and more dangerous.
Sally’s outer bands unleashed a relentless rain that began in the morning and continued unabated all day and into the night, threatening to deluge coastal communities in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi. Meteorologists worried — and almost marveled — as the storm pushed forward at a speed of just 2 miles per hour, shifting erratically in its path and intensity.
Scientists saw Sally’s stall over the warm waters of the Gulf as yet another effect of climate change in the United States, coming as wildfires along the West Coast have incinerated millions of acres and sent foul air into the atmosphere as far away as Washington, D.C. A scorching summer — made worse by the burning of fossil fuels, experts say — led to dry conditions that helped turn this year’s wildfires into the worst ever recorded.
Fires were still burning out of control in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest on Tuesday, and air quality in the region — some of the worst in the world — prompted the closure of some schools, parks and beaches.
With the authorities pleading with residents to stay indoors, the hunt for missing people continued in scorched communities. In New Mexico, scientists were investigating whether the deaths of huge numbers of birds were caused by the smoke plumes altering their migratory routes or poisoning them in the air.
And all this amid a hurricane season that is among the most active on record. Last month, Hurricane Laura tore across southwest Louisiana, leaving a trail of destruction and cutting electricity that has yet to be restored to many communities.
Climate change has made hurricanes wetter and slower, scientists have found. Recent research suggests that global warming — specifically in the Arctic, which is warming much more rapidly than other regions — is playing a role in weakening atmospheric circulation and thus potentially affecting hurricane speed.
A 2018 study found that since the middle of the 20th century, translation speeds of all hurricanes and tropical storms had decreased by about 10 percent. Another study that year that focused on Atlantic hurricanes found that the average speed of storms near the North American coast had slowed by more than 15 percent.
In Bayou La Batre, Ala., where Sally was already turning roads into rivers on Tuesday, Ernest Nelson, a retired commercial fisherman, reached a similar conclusion as he sought refuge under a house raised 10 feet off the ground on concrete pillars.
Storms were getting bigger and more intense, he said. Mr. Nelson, who had worked the water for decades, gave his basis for that belief: “No meteorologist. No college degree. Experience.”
On Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center reported that Sally’s translation speed, the rate at which it moves forward, was about 2 miles per hour, and that the storm was not expected to accelerate much as it moved northward in the Gulf of Mexico toward an expected landfall on Wednesday. It was stalling, in effect, as it approached the Mississippi coast.
But rather than serve as a source of comfort, its languid speed only intensified the unease: Sally, which intensified into a Category 2 storm early Wednesday, is dangerous, meteorologists warned, precisely because it is so slow. Its lingering could translate into major flooding, with more rain than the region typically records over several months.
Hurricane Paulette, by contrast, was zipping along in the Atlantic on Tuesday with a translation speed of more than 25 m.p.h. after passing Bermuda two days earlier.
Other recent hurricanes have also stalled. A year ago, Dorian crawled over the Bahamas for a day and a half, causing widespread destruction from wind and storm surge. And Harvey, perhaps the best-known — and most costly — example of stalling, was no longer a hurricane by the time it slowed near Houston in August 2017. It had been downgraded to a tropical storm, but still it inundated the city and surrounding communities with four feet or more of rain over several days.
As Sally churned in the Gulf, the conditions left many living along the coast perplexed and unnerved. No strangers to hurricanes, they weighed the risks of hunkering down against fleeing.
The confusion came from the storm’s apparent fickleness, as the forecast constantly evolved in recent days, with predictions that included reaching west of New Orleans or hitting Biloxi, Miss. On Tuesday evening, the forecast said it was continuing on a path aimed for Mobile Bay, Ala., likely making landfall Wednesday morning.
Still, officials and meteorologists said there was a measure of certainty in the threat that Sally posed. The rainfall could reach as high as 30 inches in some areas from the Florida panhandle to Mississippi.
The rainfall would compound a storm surge that could reach as high as four to six feet around Dauphin Island and the Mobile Bay on the Alabama coast, according to the National Hurricane Center. Forecasters from the center also warned of life-threatening flash floods.
“I can tell you from many years of experience and many times passed, I’ve seen streets and neighborhoods quickly fill up with five, six, seven and even more depth of water in a short period of time,” Sam Cochran, the Mobile County sheriff, said during a briefing on Tuesday.
And if residents stay behind, he added, it might be “a couple of days or longer before we can get you out.”
A hurricane warning remained in effect for an area stretching eastward from Bay St. Louis, Miss., near the Louisiana border, to Navarre, near the tip of the Florida panhandle — a distance that includes most of Mississippi’s and Alabama’s coastlines.
A tropical storm warning covered the area west of the Pearl River to Grand Isle, La. — including metropolitan New Orleans — and east of Navarre to Indian Pass, Fla.
Officials urged people living along the coast and in low-lying areas to clear out, taking advantage of the storm’s snail-like pace to avoid being trapped in floodwaters.
Intense waterfalls of rain began pelting Mobile, an old port city of about 190,000 people, on Tuesday morning. The streets were mostly empty, but many residents had chosen to stay home to ride out a storm that was expected to deposit more than two feet of rain.
Alonzo Johnson, a high school football coach, was sitting on the front porch of the 80-year-old Craftsman home where he lives with his family south of downtown. There was nothing to do but watch the rain and see how high it would go. Mr. Johnson, 47, said that floodwaters had gone to the bottom of a stop sign across the street in the past. During Katrina, the water had lapped up to the top of his porch, about two feet off the ground.
“We’re anxious,” he said. If the water gets high enough, the family would retreat to the back of the house, which is a bit higher. “We’ll find a safe space where we can get to praying.”
In the oyster and fishing town of Bayou La Batre, how Mr. Nelson found himself under a house, and how the house got built in the first place, was tangled in the long, painful drama of a changing climate that has irrevocably complicated life along the Gulf Coast.
Mr. Nelson, 66, had been living more than 300 miles west of Bayou La Batre, in the small Louisiana town of Hackberry. But a few weeks ago, Hurricane Laura roared out of the Gulf and devastated Hackberry, including Mr. Nelson’s home, a little travel trailer right on the water.
“You’re looking at the last person to get out of Hackberry,” said Mr. Nelson, who made his escape just before Laura’s landfall, when his sister Stephenie Bosarge, 63, picked him up and brought him to her elevated home just off the water on the Alabama shore.
A different house had been on the property before Hurricane Katrina blew it away in 2005, along with Ms. Bosarge’s wedding bands, family photos and oyster shop. The Volunteers of America came through town and built her this new raised house a few blocks from the water.
Since Katrina, many houses in Bayou La Batre are now jacked up on stilts, and people have their ways of figuring out what to do with all that space below, parking a truck or boat, stashing junk or storing tools. At her house, Ms. Bosarge installed a tiki bar, some porch swings and a stereo system.
Soon, they planned on evacuating, riding out the storm with a relative on higher ground in Grand Bay. But for the time being, the siblings sat on their porch swings, watching this new slow-moving disaster unfold around them, wondering how high the water would rise and joking about Mr. Nelson’s bad fortune.
But they were serious about what had happened to their way of life, and the life of so many other Gulf people. “It is coming to an end,” Ms. Bosarge said. “Baby, I knew that years ago.”

Amid the chaotic news cycle of the election, there has been some groundbreaking reporting from Bloomberg News about what Exxon and other oil companies knew about climate change, and how they spent billions to bury the information. Now the L.C.V. Victory Fund, a super PAC allied with the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental group, is taking the issue to the presidential stage, to Big Oil, and to President Trump.
THE MESSAGE It's a familiar, and potent, attack often levied against corporations that profit while damaging public health: Wealthy executives are never made to feel the true repercussions of their actions. 
  The ad features actors playing oil moguls lounging in mansions and acknowledging that they know that ''the world is on fire'' but that ''this climate thing is your problem.''
  One faux executive explains how oil companies ''invested in political campaigns'' as the screen shows President Trump calling human-caused climate change ''a hoax.'' He lauds the president for ''rolling back all those fossil fuel regulations.''
  The ad ends with a nod to future generations, as one executive turns to the camera says, ''You got a lot of work to do, because your kids are going to need it,'' then toasts Mr. Trump.
  FACT CHECK Mr. Trump did indeed call global warming a hoax on the campaign trail in 2015. And his administration has rolled back more than five dozen environmental regulations, according to a tally kept by The Times.
  In 2015, Inside Climate News reported that Exxon's own internal research and data showed that the company was aware of the impact of fossil fuels on global warming for decades, and that it played down studies on climate change by sowing uncertainty.
  This week, Bloomberg News reported that ''Exxon Mobil Corp. had plans to increase annual carbon-dioxide emissions by as much as the output of the entire nation of Greece,'' with an internal assessment of its investment strategy showing ''yearly emissions rising 17 percent by 2025.'' (The company said in a statement to Bloomberg that the assessment was preliminary and that its projections had since changed.)
  WHERE IT'S RUNNING A $2 million campaign on national cable, as well as digitally in Arizona, a swing state that Mr. Trump won in 2016 but where Joseph R. Biden is now leading in polls.
  THE TAKEAWAY Climate change is among the most important issues to young voters, and the threat to the global climate, with the daily reminders of vast wildfires and powerful hurricanes, is a galvanizing force this election cycle. Directing that energy in the electorate at villainous wealthy executives and tying them to Mr. Trump directly injects the president into a situation most voters recoil at: the wealthy taking advantage of the rest.

Prologue The world has warmed more than one degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution. The Paris climate agreement -- the nonbinding, unenforceable and already unheeded treaty signed on Earth Day in 2016 -- hoped to restrict warming to two degrees. The odds of succeeding, according to a recent study based on current emissions trends, are one in 20. If by mirac le we are able to limit warming to two degrees, we will only have to negotiate the extinction of the world's tropical reefs, sea-level rise of several meters and the abandonment of the Persian Gulf. The climate scientist James Hansen has called two-degree warming ''a prescription for long-term disaster.'' Long-term disaster is now the best-case scenario. Three-degree warming is a prescription for short-term disaster: forests in the Arctic and the loss of most coastal cities. 
Robert Watson, a former director of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has argued that three-degree warming is the realistic minimum. Four degrees: Europe in permanent drought; vast areas of China, India and Bangladesh claimed by desert; Polynesia swallowed by the sea; the Colorado River thinned to a trickle; the American Southwest largely uninhabitable. The prospect of a five-degree warming has prompted some of the world's leading climate scientists to warn of the end of human civilization.
Is it a comfort or a curse, the knowledge that we could have avoided all this? 
  Because in the decade that ran from 1979 to 1989, we had an excellent opportunity to solve the climate crisis. The world's major powers came within several signatures of endorsing a binding, global framework to reduce carbon emissions -- far closer than we've come since. During those years, the conditions for success could not have been more favorable. The obstacles we blame for our current inaction had yet to emerge. Almost nothing stood in our way -- nothing except ourselves.
  Nearly everything we understand about global warming was understood in 1979. By that year, data collected since 1957 confirmed what had been known since before the turn of the 20th century: Human beings have altered Earth's atmosphere through the indiscriminate burning of fossil fuels. The main scientific questions were settled beyond debate, and as the 1980s began, attention turned from diagnosis of the problem to refinement of the predicted consequences. Compared with string theory and genetic engineering, the ''greenhouse effect'' -- a metaphor dating to the early 1900s -- was ancient history, described in any Introduction to Biology textbook. Nor was the basic science especially complicated. It could be reduced to a simple axiom: The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet. And every year, by burning coal, oil and gas, humankind belched increasingly obscene quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
  Why didn't we act? A common boogeyman today is the fossil-fuel industry, which in recent decades has committed to playing the role of villain with comic-book bravado. An entire subfield of climate literature has chronicled the machinations of industry lobbyists, the corruption of scientists and the propaganda campaigns that even now continue to debase the political debate, long after the largest oil-and-gas companies have abandoned the dumb show of denialism. But the coordinated efforts to bewilder the public did not begin in earnest until the end of 1989. During the preceding decade, some of the largest oil companies, including Exxon and Shell, made good-faith efforts to understand the scope of the crisis and grapple with possible solutions.
  Nor can the Republican Party be blamed. Today, only 42 percent of Republicans know that ''most scientists believe global warming is occurring,'' and that percentage is falling. But during the 1980s, many prominent Republicans joined Democrats in judging the climate problem to be a rare political winner: nonpartisan and of the highest possible stakes. Among those who called for urgent, immediate and far-reaching climate policy were Senators John Chafee, Robert Stafford and David Durenberger; the E.P.A. administrator, William K. Reilly; and, during his campaign for president, George H.W. Bush. As Malcolm Forbes Baldwin, the acting chairman of the president's Council for Environmental Quality, told industry executives in 1981, ''There can be no more important or conservative concern than the protection of the globe itself.'' The issue was unimpeachable, like support for veterans or small business. Except the climate had an even broader constituency, composed of every human being on Earth.
  It was understood that action would have to come immediately. At the start of the 1980s, scientists within the federal government predicted that conclusive evidence of warming would appear on the global temperature record by the end of the decade, at which point it would be too late to avoid disaster. More than 30 percent of the human population lacked access to electricity. Billions of people would not need to attain the ''American way of life'' in order to drastically increase global carbon emissions; a light bulb in every village would do it. A report prepared at the request of the White House by the National Academy of Sciences advised that ''the carbon-dioxide issue should appear on the international agenda in a context that will maximize cooperation and consensus-building and minimize political manipulation, controversy and division.'' If the world had adopted the proposal widely endorsed at the end of the '80s -- a freezing of carbon emissions, with a reduction of 20 percent by 2005 -- warming could have been held to less than 1.5 degrees.
  A broad international consensus had settled on a solution: a global treaty to curb carbon emissions. The idea began to coalesce as early as February 1979, at the first World Climate Conference in Geneva, when scientists from 50 nations agreed unanimously that it was ''urgently necessary'' to act. Four months later, at the Group of 7 meeting in Tokyo, the leaders of the world's seven wealthiest nations signed a statement resolving to reduce carbon emissions. Ten years later, the first major diplomatic meeting to approve the framework for a binding treaty was called in the Netherlands. Delegates from more than 60 nations attended, with the goal of establishing a global summit meeting to be held about a year later. Among scientists and world leaders, the sentiment was unanimous: Action had to be taken, and the United States would need to lead. It didn't.
  The inaugural chapter of the climate-change saga is over. In that chapter -- call it Apprehension -- we identified the threat and its consequences. We spoke, with increasing urgency and self-delusion, of the prospect of triumphing against long odds. But we did not seriously consider the prospect of failure. We understood what failure would mean for global temperatures, coastlines, agricultural yield, immigration patterns, the world economy. But we have not allowed ourselves to comprehend what failure might mean for us. How will it change the way we see ourselves, how we remember the past, how we imagine the future? Why did we do this to ourselves? These questions will be the subject of climate change's second chapter -- call it The Reckoning. There can be no understanding of our current and future predicament without understanding why we failed to solve this problem when we had the chance.
  That we came so close, as a civilization, to breaking our suicide pact with fossil fuels can be credited to the efforts of a handful of people, among them a hyperkinetic lobbyist and a guileless atmospheric physicist who, at great personal cost, tried to warn humanity of what was coming. They risked their careers in a painful, escalating campaign to solve the problem, first in scientific reports, later through conventional avenues of political persuasion and finally with a strategy of public shaming. Their efforts were shrewd, passionate, robust. And they failed. What follows is their story, and ours.
  1. 'This Is the Whole Banana'Spring 1979
  The first suggestion to Rafe Pomerance that humankind was destroying the conditions necessary for its own survival came on Page 66 of the government publication EPA-600/7-78-019. It was a technical report about coal, bound in a coal-black cover with beige lettering -- one of many such reports that lay in uneven piles around Pomerance's windowless office on the first floor of the Capitol Hill townhouse that, in the late 1970s, served as the Washington headquarters of Friends of the Earth. In the final paragraph of a chapter on environmental regulation, the coal report's authors noted that the continued use of fossil fuels might, within two or three decades, bring about ''significant and damaging'' changes to the global atmosphere.
  Pomerance paused, startled, over the orphaned paragraph. It seemed to have come out of nowhere. He reread it. It made no sense to him. Pomerance was not a scientist; he graduated from Cornell 11 years earlier with a degree in history. He had the tweedy appearance of an undernourished doctoral student emerging at dawn from the stacks. He wore horn-rimmed glasses and a thickish mustache that wilted disapprovingly over the corners of his mouth, though his defining characteristic was his gratuitous height, 6 feet 4 inches, which seemed to embarrass him; he stooped over to accommodate his interlocutors. He had an active face prone to breaking out in wide, even maniacal grins, but in composure, as when he read the coal pamphlet, it projected concern. He struggled with technical reports. He proceeded as a historian might: cautiously, scrutinizing the source material, reading between the lines. When that failed, he made phone calls, often to the authors of the reports, who tended to be surprised to hear from him. Scientists, he had found, were not in the habit of fielding questions from political lobbyists. They were not in the habit of thinking about politics.
  Pomerance had one big question about the coal report. If the burning of coal, oil and natural gas could invite global catastrophe, why had nobody told him about it? If anyone in Washington -- if anyone in the United States -- should have been aware of such a danger, it was Pomerance. As the deputy legislative director of Friends of the Earth, the wily, pugnacious nonprofit that David Brower helped found after resigning from the Sierra Club a decade earlier, Pomerance was one of the nation's most connected environmental activists. That he was as easily accepted in the halls of the Dirksen Senate Office Building as at Earth Day rallies might have had something to do with the fact that he was a Morgenthau -- the great-grandson of Henry Sr., Woodrow Wilson's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire; great-nephew of Henry Jr., Franklin D. Roosevelt's Treasury secretary; second cousin to Robert, district attorney for Manhattan. Or perhaps it was just his charisma -- voluble, energetic and obsessive, he seemed to be everywhere, speaking with everyone, in a very loud voice, at once. His chief obsession was air. After working as an organizer for welfare rights, he spent the second half of his 20s laboring to protect and expand the Clean Air Act, the comprehensive law regulating air pollution. That led him to the problem of acid rain, and the coal report.
  He showed the unsettling paragraph to his office mate, Betsy Agle. Had she ever heard of the ''greenhouse effect''? Was it really possible that human beings were overheating the planet?
  Agle shrugged. She hadn't heard about it, either.
  That might have been the end of it, had Agle not greeted Pomerance in the office a few mornings later holding a copy of a newspaper forwarded by Friends of the Earth's Denver office. Isn't this what you were talking about the other day? she asked.
  Agle pointed to an article about a prominent geophysicist named Gordon MacDonald, who was conducting a study on climate change with the Jasons, the mysterious coterie of elite scientists to which he belonged. Pomerance hadn't heard of MacDonald, but he knew all about the Jasons. They were like one of those teams of superheroes with complementary powers that join forces in times of galactic crisis. They had been brought together by federal agencies, including the C.I.A, to devise scientific solutions to national-security problems: how to detect an incoming missile; how to predict fallout from a nuclear bomb; how to develop unconventional weapons, like plague-infested rats. The Jasons' activities had been a secret until the publication of the Pentagon Papers, which exposed their plan to festoon the Ho Chi Minh Trail with motion sensors that signaled to bombers. After the furor that followed -- protesters set MacDonald's garage on fire -- the Jasons began to use their powers for peace instead of war.
  There was an urgent problem that demanded their attention, MacDonald believed, because human civilization faced an existential crisis. In ''How to Wreck the Environment,'' a 1968 essay published while he was a science adviser to Lyndon Johnson, MacDonald predicted a near future in which ''nuclear weapons were effectively banned and the weapons of mass destruction were those of environmental catastrophe.'' One of the most potentially devastating such weapons, he believed, was the gas that we exhaled with every breath: carbon dioxide. By vastly increasing carbon emissions, the world's most advanced militaries could alter weather patterns and wreak famine, drought and economic collapse.
  In the decade since then, MacDonald had been alarmed to see humankind begin in earnest to weaponize weather -- not out of malice, but unwittingly. During the spring of 1977 and the summer of 1978, the Jasons met to determine what would happen once the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubled from pre-Industrial Revolution levels. It was an arbitrary milestone, the doubling, but a useful one, as its inevitability was not in question; the threshold would most likely be breached by 2035. The Jasons' report to the Department of Energy, ''The Long-Term Impact of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide on Climate,'' was written in an understated tone that only enhanced its nightmarish findings: Global temperatures would increase by an average of two to three degrees Celsius; Dust Bowl conditions would ''threaten large areas of North America, Asia and Africa''; access to drinking water and agricultural production would fall, triggering mass migration on an unprecedented scale. ''Perhaps the most ominous feature,'' however, was the effect of a changing climate on the poles. Even a minimal warming ''could lead to rapid melting'' of the West Antarctic ice sheet. The ice sheet contained enough water to raise the level of the oceans 16 feet.
  The Jasons sent the report to dozens of scientists in the United States and abroad; to industry groups like the National Coal Association and the Electric Power Research Institute; and within the government, to the National Academy of Sciences, the Commerce Department, the E.P.A., NASA, the Pentagon, the N.S.A., every branch of the military, the National Security Council and the White House.
  Pomerance read about the atmospheric crisis in a state of shock that swelled briskly into outrage. ''This,'' he told Betsy Agle, ''is the whole banana.''
  Gordon MacDonald worked at the federally funded Mitre Corporation, a think tank that works with agencies throughout the government. His title was senior research analyst, which was another way of saying senior science adviser to the national-intelligence community. After a single phone call, Pomerance, a former Vietnam War protester and conscientious objector, drove several miles on the Beltway to a group of anonymous white office buildings that more closely resembled the headquarters of a regional banking firm than the solar plexus of the American military-industrial complex. He was shown into the office of a brawny, soft-spoken man in blocky, horn-rimmed frames, who extended a hand like a bear's paw.
  ''I'm glad you're interested in this,'' MacDonald said, sizing up the young activist.
  ''How could I not be?'' Pomerance said. ''How could anyone not be?''
  MacDonald explained that he first studied the carbon-dioxide issue when he was about Pomerance's age -- in 1961, when he served as an adviser to John F. Kennedy. Pomerance pieced together that MacDonald, in his youth, had been something of a prodigy: In his 20s, he advised Dwight D. Eisenhower on space exploration; at 32, he became a member of the National Academy of Sciences; at 40, he was appointed to the inaugural Council on Environmental Quality, where he advised Richard Nixon on the environmental dangers of burning coal. He monitored the carbon-dioxide problem the whole time, with increasing alarm.
  MacDonald spoke for two hours. Pomerance was appalled. ''If I set up briefings with some people on the Hill,'' he asked MacDonald, ''will you tell them what you just told me?''
  Thus began the Gordon and Rafe carbon-dioxide roadshow. Beginning in the spring of 1979, Pomerance arranged informal briefings with the E.P.A., the National Security Council, The New York Times, the Council on Environmental Quality and the Energy Department, which, Pomerance learned, had established an Office of Carbon Dioxide Effects two years earlier at MacDonald's urging. The men settled into a routine, with MacDonald explaining the science and Pomerance adding the exclamation points. They were surprised to learn how few senior officials were familiar with the Jasons' findings, let alone understood the ramifications of global warming. At last, having worked their way up the federal hierarchy, the two went to see the president's top scientist, Frank Press.
  Press's office was in the Old Executive Office Building, the granite fortress that stands on the White House grounds just paces away from the West Wing. Out of respect for MacDonald, Press had summoned to their meeting what seemed to be the entire senior staff of the president's Office of Science and Technology Policy -- the officials consulted on every critical matter of energy and national security. What Pomerance had expected to be yet another casual briefing assumed the character of a high-level national-security meeting. He decided to let MacDonald do all the talking. There was no need to emphasize to Press and his lieutenants that this was an issue of profound national significance. The hushed mood in the office told him that this was already understood.
  To explain what the carbon-dioxide problem meant for the future, MacDonald would begin his presentation by going back more than a century to John Tyndall -- an Irish physicist who was an early champion of Charles Darwin's work and died after being accidentally poisoned by his wife. In 1859, Tyndall found that carbon dioxide absorbed heat and that variations in the composition of the atmosphere could create changes in climate. These findings inspired Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish chemist and future Nobel laureate, to deduce in 1896 that the combustion of coal and petroleum could raise global temperatures. This warming would become noticeable in a few centuries, Arrhenius calculated, or sooner if consumption of fossil fuels continued to increase.
  Consumption increased beyond anything the Swedish chemist could have imagined. Four decades later, a British steam engineer named Guy Stewart Callendar discovered that, at the weather stations he observed, the previous five years were the hottest in recorded history. Humankind, he wrote in a paper, had become ''able to speed up the processes of Nature.'' That was in 1939.
  MacDonald's voice was calm but authoritative, his powerful, heavy hands conveying the force of his argument. He was a geophysicist trapped in the body of an offensive lineman -- he had turned down a football scholarship to Rice in order to attend Harvard -- and seemed miscast as a preacher of atmospheric physics and existential doom. His audience listened in bowed silence. Pomerance couldn't read them. Political bureaucrats were skilled at hiding their opinions. Pomerance wasn't. He shifted restlessly in his chair, glancing between MacDonald and the government suits, trying to see whether they grasped the shape of the behemoth that MacDonald was describing.
  MacDonald's history concluded with Roger Revelle, perhaps the most distinguished of the priestly caste of government scientists who, since the Manhattan Project, advised every president on major policy; he had been a close colleague of MacDonald and Press since they served together under Kennedy. In a 1957 paper written with Hans Suess, Revelle concluded that ''human beings are now carrying out a large-scale geophysical experiment of a kind that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the future.'' Revelle helped the Weather Bureau establish a continuous measurement of atmospheric carbon dioxide at a site perched near the summit of Mauna Loa on the Big Island of Hawaii, 11,500 feet above the sea -- a rare pristine natural laboratory on a planet blanketed by fossil-fuel emissions. A young geochemist named Charles David Keeling charted the data. Keeling's graph came to be known as the Keeling curve, though it more closely resembled a jagged lightning bolt hurled toward the firmament. MacDonald had a habit of tracing the Keeling curve in the air, his thick forefinger jabbing toward the ceiling.
  After nearly a decade of observation, Revelle had shared his concerns with Lyndon Johnson, who included them in a special message to Congress two weeks after his inauguration. Johnson explained that his generation had ''altered the composition of the atmosphere on a global scale'' through the burning of fossil fuels, and his administration commissioned a study of the subject by his Science Advisory Committee. Revelle was its chairman, and its 1965 executive report on carbon dioxide warned of the rapid melting of Antarctica, rising seas, increased acidity of fresh waters -- changes that would require no less than a coordinated global effort to forestall.
  In 1974, the C.I.A. issued a classified report on the carbon-dioxide problem. It concluded that climate change had begun around 1960 and had ''already caused major economic problems throughout the world.'' The future economic and political impacts would be ''almost beyond comprehension.'' Yet emissions continued to rise, and at this rate, MacDonald warned, they could see a snowless New England, the swamping of major coastal cities, as much as a 40 percent decline in national wheat production, the forced migration of about one-quarter of the world's population. Not within centuries -- within their own lifetimes.
  ''What would you have us do?'' Press asked.
  The president's plan, in the wake of the Saudi oil crisis, to promote solar energy -- he had gone so far as to install 32 photovoltaic panels on the roof of the White House to heat his family's water -- was a good start, MacDonald thought. But Carter's plan to stimulate production of synthetic fuels -- gas and liquid fuel extracted from shale and tar sands -- was a dangerous idea. Nuclear power, despite the recent tragedy at Three Mile Island, should be expanded. But even natural gas and ethanol were preferable to coal. There was no way around it: Coal production would ultimately have to end.
  The president's advisers asked respectful questions, but Pomerance couldn't tell whether they were persuaded. The men all stood and shook hands, and Press led MacDonald and Pomerance out of his office. After they emerged from the Old Executive Office Building onto Pennsylvania Avenue, Pomerance asked MacDonald what he thought would happen.
  Knowing Frank as I do, MacDonald said, I really couldn't tell you.
  In the days that followed, Pomerance grew uneasy. Until this point, he had fixated on the science of the carbon-dioxide issue and its possible political ramifications. But now that his meetings on Capitol Hill had concluded, he began to question what all this might mean for his own future. His wife, Lenore, was eight months pregnant; was it ethical, he wondered, to bring a child onto a planet that before much longer could become inhospitable to life? And he wondered why it had fallen to him, a 32-year-old lobbyist without scientific training, to bring greater attention to this crisis.
  Finally, weeks later, MacDonald called to tell him that Press had taken up the issue. On May 22, Press wrote a letter to the president of the National Academy of Sciences requesting a full assessment of the carbon-dioxide issue. Jule Charney, the father of modern meteorology, would gather the nation's top oceanographers, atmospheric scientists and climate modelers to judge whether MacDonald's alarm was justified -- whether the world was, in fact, headed to cataclysm.
  Pomerance was amazed by how much momentum had built in such a short time. Scientists at the highest levels of government had known about the dangers of fossil-fuel combustion for decades. Yet they had produced little besides journal articles, academic symposiums, technical reports. Nor had any politician, journalist or activist championed the issue. That, Pomerance figured, was about to change. If Charney's group confirmed that the world was careering toward an existential crisis, the president would be forced to act.
  2.The Whimsies of The Invisible WorldSpring 1979
  There was a brown velvet love seat in the living room of James and Anniek Hansen, under a bright window looking out on Morningside Park in Manhattan, that nobody ever sat in. Erik, their 2-year-old son, was forbidden to go near it. The ceiling above the couch sagged ominously, as if pregnant with some alien life form, and the bulge grew with each passing week. Jim promised Anniek that he would fix it, which was only fair, because it had been on his insistence that they gave up the prospect of a prewar apartment in Spuyten Duyvil overlooking the Hudson and moved from Riverdale to this two-story walk-up with crumbling walls, police-siren lullabies and gravid ceiling. Jim had resented the 45-minute commute to NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan and complained that such a gross waste of his time would soon be unsustainable, once the Pioneer spacecraft reached Venus and began to beam back data. But even after the Hansens moved within a few blocks of the institute, Jim couldn't make time for the ceiling, and after four months it finally burst, releasing a confetti of browned pipes and splintered wood.
  Jim repeated his vow to fix the ceiling as soon as he had a moment free from work. Anniek held him to his word, though it required her to live with a hole in her ceiling until Thanksgiving -- seven months of plaster dust powdering the love seat.
  Another promise Jim made to Anniek: He would make it home for dinner every night by 7 p.m. By 8:30, however, he was back at his calculations. Anniek did not begrudge him his deep commitment to his work; it was one of the things she loved about him. Still, it baffled her that the subject of his obsession should be the atmospheric conditions of a planet more than 24 million miles away. It baffled Jim, too. His voyage to Venus from Denison, Iowa, the fifth child of a diner waitress and an itinerant farmer turned bartender, had been a series of bizarre twists of fate over which he claimed no agency. It was just something that happened to him.
  Hansen figured he was the only scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who, as a child, did not dream of outer space. He dreamed only of baseball. On clear nights, his transistor radio picked up the broadcast of the Kansas City Blues, the New York Yankees' AAA affiliate. Every morning, he cut out the box scores, pasted them into a notebook and tallied statistics. Hansen found comfort in numbers and equations. He majored in math and physics at the University of Iowa, but he never would have taken an interest in celestial matters were it not for the unlikely coincidence of two events during the year he graduated: the eruption of a volcano in Bali and a total eclipse of the moon.
  On the night of Dec. 30, 1963 -- whipping wind, 12 degrees below zero -- Hansen accompanied his astronomy professor to a cornfield far from town. They set a telescope in an old corncrib and, between 2 and 8 in the morning, made continuous photoelectric recordings of the eclipse, pausing only when the extension cord froze and when they dashed to the car for a few minutes to avoid frostbite.
  During an eclipse, the moon resembles a tangerine or, if the eclipse is total, a drop of blood. But this night, the moon vanished altogether. Hansen made the mystery the subject of his master's thesis, concluding that the moon had been obscured by the dust erupted into the atmosphere by Mount Agung, on the other side of the planet from his corncrib, six months earlier. The discovery led to his fascination with the influence of invisible particles on the visible world. You could not make sense of the visible world until you understood the whimsies of the invisible one.
  One of the leading authorities on the invisible world happened to be teaching then at Iowa: James Van Allen made the first major discovery of the space age, identifying the two doughnut-shaped regions of convulsing particles that circle Earth, now known as the Van Allen belts. At Van Allen's prodding, Hansen turned from the moon to Venus. Why, he tried to determine, was its surface so hot? In 1967, a Soviet satellite beamed back the answer: The planet's atmosphere was mainly carbon dioxide. Though once it may have had habitable temperatures, it was believed to have succumbed to a runaway greenhouse effect: As the sun grew brighter, Venus's ocean began to evaporate, thickening the atmosphere, which forced yet greater evaporation -- a self-perpetuating cycle that finally boiled off the ocean entirely and heated the planet's surface to more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit. At the other extreme, Mars's thin atmosphere had insufficient carbon dioxide to trap much heat at all, leaving it about 900 degrees colder. Earth lay in the middle, its Goldilocks greenhouse effect just strong enough to support life.
  Anniek expected Jim's professional life to resume some semblance of normality once the data from Venus had been collected and analyzed. But shortly after Pioneer entered Venus's atmosphere, Hansen came home from the office in an uncharacteristic fervor -- with an apology. The prospect of two or three more years of intense work had sprung up before him. NASA was expanding its study of Earth's atmospheric conditions. Hansen had already done some work on Earth's atmosphere for Jule Charney at the Goddard Institute, helping to develop computerized weather models. Now Hansen would have an opportunity to apply to Earth the lessons he had learned from Venus.
  We want to learn more about Earth's climate, Jim told Anniek -- and how humanity can influence it. He would use giant new supercomputers to map the planet's atmosphere. They would create Mirror Worlds: parallel realities that mimicked our own. These digital simulacra, technically called ''general circulation models,'' combined the mathematical formulas that governed the behavior of the sea, land and sky into a single computer model. Unlike the real world, they could be sped forward to reveal the future.
  Anniek's disappointment -- another several years of distraction, stress, time spent apart from family -- was tempered, if only slightly, by the high strain of Jim's enthusiasm. She thought she understood it. Does this mean, she asked, that you'll able to predict weather more accurately?
  Yes, Jim said. Something like that.
  3.Between CatastropheAnd Chaos July 1979
  The scientists summoned by Jule Charney to judge the fate of civilization arrived on July 23, 1979, with their wives, children and weekend bags at a three-story mansion in Woods Hole, on the southwestern spur of Cape Cod. They would review all the available science and decide whether the White House should take seriously Gordon MacDonald's prediction of a climate apocalypse. The Jasons had predicted a warming of two or three degrees Celsius by the middle of the 21st century, but like Roger Revelle before them, they emphasized their reasons for uncertainty. Charney's scientists were asked to quantify that uncertainty. They had to get it right: Their conclusion would be delivered to the president. But first they would hold a clambake.
  They gathered with their families on a bluff overlooking Quissett Harbor and took turns tossing mesh produce bags stuffed with lobster, clams and corn into a bubbling caldron. While the children scrambled across the rolling lawn, the scientists mingled with a claque of visiting dignitaries, whose status lay somewhere between chaperone and client -- men from the Departments of State, Energy, Defense and Agriculture; the E.P.A.; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They exchanged pleasantries and took in the sunset. It was a hot day, high 80s, but the harbor breeze was salty and cool. It didn't look like the dawning of an apocalypse. The government officials, many of them scientists themselves, tried to suppress their awe of the legends in their presence: Henry Stommel, the world's leading oceanographer; his protégé, Carl Wunsch, a Jason; the Manhattan Project alumnus Cecil Leith; the Harvard planetary physicist Richard Goody. These were the men who, in the last three decades, had discovered foundational principles underlying the relationships among sun, atmosphere, land and ocean -- which is to say, the climate.
  The hierarchy was made visible during the workshop sessions, held in the carriage house next door: The scientists sat at tables arranged in a rectangle, while their federal observers sat along the room's perimeter, taking in the action as at a theater in the round. The first two days of meetings didn't make very good theater, however, as the scientists reviewed the basic principles of the carbon cycle, ocean circulation, radiative transfer. On the third day, Charney introduced a new prop: a black speaker, attached to a telephone. He dialed, and Jim Hansen answered.
  Charney called Hansen because he had grasped that in order to determine the exact range of future warming, his group would have to venture into the realm of the Mirror Worlds. Jule Charney himself had used a general circulation model to revolutionize weather prediction. But Hansen was one of just a few modelers who had studied the effects of carbon emissions. When, at Charney's request, Hansen programmed his model to consider a future of doubled carbon dioxide, it predicted a temperature increase of four degrees Celsius. That was twice as much warming as the prediction made by the most prominent climate modeler, Syukuro Manabe, whose government lab at Princeton was the first to model the greenhouse effect. The difference between the two predictions -- between warming of two degrees Celsius and four degrees Celsius -- was the difference between damaged coral reefs and no reefs whatsoever, between thinning forests and forests enveloped by desert, between catastrophe and chaos.
  In the carriage house, the disembodied voice of Jim Hansen explained, in a quiet, matter-of-fact tone, how his model weighed the influences of clouds, oceans and snow on warming. The older scientists interrupted, shouting questions; when they did not transmit through the telephone, Charney repeated them in a bellow. The questions kept coming, often before their younger respondent could finish his answers, and Hansen wondered if it wouldn't have been easier for him to drive the five hours and meet with them in person.
  Among Charney's group was Akio Arakawa, a pioneer of computer modeling. On the final night at Woods Hole, Arakawa stayed up in his motel room with printouts from the models by Hansen and Manabe blanketing his double bed. The discrepancy between the models, Arakawa concluded, came down to ice and snow. The whiteness of the world's snowfields reflected light; if snow melted in a warmer climate, less radiation would escape the atmosphere, leading to even greater warming. Shortly before dawn, Arakawa concluded that Manabe had given too little weight to the influence of melting sea ice, while Hansen had overemphasized it. The best estimate lay in between. Which meant that the Jasons' calculation was too optimistic. When carbon dioxide doubled in 2035 or thereabouts, global temperatures would increase between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius, with the most likely outcome a warming of three degrees.
  The publication of Jule Charney's report, ''Carbon Dioxide and Climate: A Scientific Assessment,'' several months later was not accompanied by a banquet, a parade or even a news conference. Yet within the highest levels of the federal government, the scientific community and the oil-and-gas industry -- within the commonwealth of people who had begun to concern themselves with the future habitability of the planet -- the Charney report would come to have the authority of settled fact. It was the summation of all the predictions that had come before, and it would withstand the scrutiny of the decades that followed it. Charney's group had considered everything known about ocean, sun, sea, air and fossil fuels and had distilled it to a single number: three. When the doubling threshold was broached, as appeared inevitable, the world would warm three degrees Celsius. The last time the world was three degrees warmer was during the Pliocene, three million years ago, when beech trees grew in Antarctica, the seas were 80 feet higher and horses galloped across the Canadian coast of the Arctic Ocean.
  The Charney report left Jim Hansen with more urgent questions. Three degrees would be nightmarish, and unless carbon emissions ceased suddenly, three degrees would be only the beginning. The real question was whether the warming trend could be reversed. Was there time to act? And how would a global commitment to cease burning fossil fuels come about, exactly? Who had the power to make such a thing happen? Hansen didn't know how to begin to answer these questions. But he would learn.
  4. 'A Very AggressiveDefensive Program' Summer 1979-Summer 1980
  After the publication of the Charney report, Exxon decided to create its own dedicated carbon-dioxide research program, with an annual budget of $600,000. Only Exxon was asking a slightly different question than Jule Charney. Exxon didn't concern itself primarily with how much the world would warm. It wanted to know how much of the warming Exxon could be blamed for.
  A senior researcher named Henry Shaw had argued that the company needed a deeper understanding of the issue in order to influence future legislation that might restrict carbon-dioxide emissions. ''It behooves us to start a very aggressive defensive program,'' Shaw wrote in a memo to a manager, ''because there is a good probability that legislation affecting our business will be passed.''
  Shaw turned to Wallace Broecker, a Columbia University oceanographer who was the second author of Roger Revelle's 1965 carbon-dioxide report for Lyndon Johnson. In 1977, in a presentation at the American Geophysical Union, Broecker predicted that fossil fuels would have to be restricted, whether by taxation or fiat. More recently, he had testified before Congress, calling carbon dioxide ''the No.1 long-term environmental problem.'' If presidents and senators trusted Broecker to tell them the bad news, he was good enough for Exxon.
  The company had been studying the carbon-dioxide problem for decades, since before it changed its name to Exxon. In 1957, scientists from Humble Oil published a study tracking ''the enormous quantity of carbon dioxide'' contributed to the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution ''from the combustion of fossil fuels.'' Even then, the observation that burning fossil fuels had increased the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere was well understood and accepted by Humble's scientists. What was new, in 1957, was the effort to quantify what percentage of emissions had been contributed by the oil-and-gas industry.
  The American Petroleum Institute, the industry's largest trade association, asked the same question in 1958 through its air-pollution study group and replicated the findings made by Humble Oil. So did another A.P.I. study conducted by the Stanford Research Institute a decade later, in 1968, which concluded that the burning of fossil fuels would bring ''significant temperature changes'' by the year 2000 and ultimately ''serious worldwide environmental changes,'' including the melting of the Antarctic ice cap and rising seas. It was ''ironic,'' the study's authors noted, that politicians, regulators and environmentalists fixated on local incidents of air pollution that were immediately observable, while the climate crisis, whose damage would be of far greater severity and scale, went entirely unheeded.
  The ritual repeated itself every few years. Industry scientists, at the behest of their corporate bosses, reviewed the problem and found good reasons for alarm and better excuses to do nothing. Why should they act when almost nobody within the United States government -- nor, for that matter, within the environmental movement -- seemed worried? Besides, as the National Petroleum Council put it in 1972, changes in the climate would probably not be apparent ''until at least the turn of the century.'' The industry had enough urgent crises: antitrust legislation introduced by Senator Ted Kennedy; concerns about the health effects of gasoline; battles over the Clean Air Act; and the financial shock of benzene regulation, which increased the cost of every gallon of gas sold in America. Why take on an intractable problem that would not be detected until this generation of employees was safely retired? Worse, the solutions seemed more punitive than the problem itself. Historically, energy use had correlated to economic growth -- the more fossil fuels we burned, the better our lives became. Why mess with that?
  But the Charney report had changed industry's cost-benefit calculus. Now there was a formal consensus about the nature of the crisis. As Henry Shaw emphasized in his conversations with Exxon's executives, the cost of inattention would rise in step with the Keeling curve.
  Wallace Broecker did not think much of one of Exxon's proposals for its new carbon-dioxide program: testing the corked air in vintage bottles of French wine to demonstrate how much carbon levels had increased over time. But he did help his colleague Taro Takahashi with a more ambitious experiment conducted onboard one of Exxon's largest supertankers, the Esso Atlantic, to determine how much carbon the oceans could absorb before coughing it back into the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the graduate student installed on the tanker botched the job, and the data came back a mess.
  Shaw was running out of time. In 1978, an Exxon colleague circulated an internal memo warning that humankind had only five to 10 years before policy action would be necessary. But Congress seemed ready to act a lot sooner than that. On April 3, 1980, Senator Paul Tsongas, a Massachusetts Democrat, held the first congressional hearing on carbon-dioxide buildup in the atmosphere. Gordon MacDonald testified that the United States should ''take the initiative'' and develop, through the United Nations, a way to coordinate every nation's energy policies to address the problem. That June, Jimmy Carter signed the Energy Security Act of 1980, which directed the National Academy of Sciences to start a multiyear, comprehensive study, to be called ''Changing Climate,'' that would analyze social and economic effects of climate change. More urgent, the National Commission on Air Quality, at the request of Congress, invited two dozen experts, including Henry Shaw himself, to a meeting in Florida to propose climate policy.
  It seemed that some kind of legislation to restrict carbon combustion was inevitable. The Charney report had confirmed the diagnosis of the problem -- a problem that Exxon helped create. Now Exxon would help shape the solution.
  5.'We Are Flying Blind' October 1980
  Two days before Halloween, Rafe Pomerance traveled to a cotton-candy castle on the Gulf of Mexico, near St. Petersburg, Fla, that locals called the Pink Palace. The Don CeSar hotel was a child's daydream with cantilevered planes of bubble-gum stucco and vanilla-white cupolas that appeared to melt in the sunshine like scoops of ice cream. The hotel stood amid blooms of poisonwood and gumbo limbo on a narrow spit of porous limestone that rose no higher than five feet above the sea. In its carnival of historical amnesia and childlike faith in the power of fantasy, the Pink Palace was a fine setting for the first rehearsal of a conversation that would be earnestly restaged, with little variation and increasing desperation, for the next 40 years.
  In the year and a half since he had read the coal report, Pomerance had attended countless conferences and briefings about the science of global warming. But until now, nobody had shown much interest in the only subject that he cared about, the only subject that mattered -- how to prevent warming. In a sense, he had himself to thank: During the expansion of the Clean Air Act, he pushed for the creation of the National Commission on Air Quality, charged with ensuring that the goals of the act were being met. One such goal was a stable global climate. The Charney report had made clear that goal was not being met, and now the commission wanted to hear proposals for legislation. It was a profound responsibility, and the two dozen experts invited to the Pink Palace -- policy gurus, deep thinkers, an industry scientist and an environmental activist -- had only three days to achieve it, but the utopian setting made everything seem possible. The conference room looked better suited to hosting a wedding party than a bureaucratic meeting, its tall windows framing postcard views of the beach. The sands were blindingly white, the surf was idle, the air unseasonably hot and the dress code relaxed: sunglasses and guayaberas, jackets frowned upon.
  ''I have a very vested interest in this,'' said Representative Tom McPherson, a Florida Democrat, introducing himself to the delegation, ''because I own substantial holdings 15 miles inland of the coast, and any beachfront property appreciates in value.'' There was no formal agenda, just a young moderator from the E.P.A. named Thomas Jorling and a few handouts left on every seat, including a copy of the Charney report. Jorling acknowledged the vagueness of their mission.
  ''We are flying blind, with little or no idea where the mountains are,'' he said. But the stakes couldn't be higher: A failure to recommend policy, he said, would be the same as endorsing the present policy -- which was no policy. He asked who wanted ''to break the ice,'' not quite appreciating the pun.
  ''We might start out with an emotional question,'' proposed Thomas Waltz, an economist at the National Climate Program. ''The question is fundamental to being a human being: Do we care?''
  This provoked huffy consternation. ''In caring or not caring,'' said John Laurmann, a Stanford engineer, ''I would think the main thing is the timing.'' It was not an emotional question, in other words, but an economic one: How much did we value the future?
  We have less time than we realize, said an M.I.T. nuclear engineer named David Rose, who studied how civilizations responded to large technological crises. ''People leave their problems until the 11th hour, the 59th minute,'' he said. ''And then: 'Eloi, Eloi, Lama Sabachthani?' '' -- ''My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?'' It was a promising beginning, Pomerance thought. Urgent, detailed, cleareyed. The attendees seemed to share a sincere interest in finding solutions. They agreed that some kind of international treaty would ultimately be needed to keep atmospheric carbon dioxide at a safe level. But nobody could agree on what that level was.
  William Elliott, a NOAA scientist, introduced some hard facts: If the United States stopped burning carbon that year, it would delay the arrival of the doubling threshold by only five years. If Western nations somehow managed to stabilize emissions, it would forestall the inevitable by only eight years. The only way to avoid the worst was to stop burning coal. Yet China, the Soviet Union and the United States, by far the world's three largest coal producers, were frantically accelerating extraction.
  ''Do we have a problem?'' asked Anthony Scoville, a congressional science consultant. ''We do, but it is not the atmospheric problem. It is the political problem.'' He doubted that any scientific report, no matter how ominous its predictions, would persuade politicians to act.
  Pomerance glanced out at the beach, where the occasional tourist dawdled in the surf. Beyond the conference room, few Americans realized that the planet would soon cease to resemble itself.
  What if the problem was that they were thinking of it as a problem? ''What I am saying,'' Scoville continued, ''is that in a sense we are making a transition not only in energy but the economy as a whole.'' Even if the coal and oil industries collapsed, renewable technologies like solar energy would take their place. Jimmy Carter was planning to invest $80 billion in synthetic fuel. ''My God,'' Scoville said, ''with $80 billion, you could have a photovoltaics industry going that would obviate the need for synfuels forever!''
  The talk of ending oil production stirred for the first time the gentleman from Exxon. ''I think there is a transition period,'' Henry Shaw said. ''We are not going to stop burning fossil fuels and start looking toward solar or nuclear fusion and so on. We are going to have a very orderly transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.''
  ''We are talking about some major fights in this country,'' said Waltz, the economist. ''We had better be thinking this thing through.''
  But first -- lunch. It was a bright day, low 80s, and the group voted to break for three hours to enjoy the Florida sun. Pomerance couldn't -- he was restless. He had refrained from speaking, happy to let others lead the discussion, provided it moved in the right direction. But the high-minded talk had soon stalled into fecklessness and pusillanimity. He reflected that he was just about the only participant without an advanced degree. But few of these policy geniuses were showing much sense. They understood what was at stake, but they hadn't taken it to heart. They remained cool, detached -- pragmatists overmatched by a problem that had no pragmatic resolution. ''Prudence,'' Jorling said, ''is essential.''
  After lunch, Jorling tried to focus the conversation. What did they need to know in order to take action?
  David Slade, who as the director of the Energy Department's $200 million Office of Carbon Dioxide Effects had probably considered the question more deeply than anyone else in the room, said he figured that at some point, probably within their lifetimes, they would see the warming themselves.
  ''And at that time,'' Pomerance bellowed, ''it will be too late to do anything about it.''
  Yet nobody could agree what to do. John Perry, a meteorologist who had worked as a staff member on the Charney report, suggested that American energy policy merely ''take into account'' the risks of global warming, though he acknowledged that a nonbinding measure might seem ''intolerably stodgy.''
  ''It is so weak,'' Pomerance said, the air seeping out of him, ''as to not get us anywhere.''
  Reading the indecision in the room, Jorling reversed himself and wondered if it might be best to avoid proposing any specific policy. ''Let's not load ourselves down with that burden,'' he said. ''We'll let others worry.''
  Pomerance begged Jorling to reconsider. The commission had asked for hard proposals. But why stop there? Why not propose a new national energy plan? ''There is no single action that is going to solve the problem,'' Pomerance said. ''You can't keep saying, That isn't going to do it, and This isn't going to do it, because then we end up doing nothing.''
  Scoville pointed out that the United States was responsible for the largest share of global carbon emissions. But not for long. ''If we're going to exercise leadership,'' he said, ''the opportunity is now.'' One way to lead, he proposed, would be to classify carbon dioxide as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and regulate it as such. This was received by the room like a belch. By Scoville's logic, every sigh was an act of pollution. Did the science really support such an extreme measure?
  The Charney report did exactly that, Pomerance said. He was beginning to lose his patience, his civility, his stamina. ''Now, if everybody wants to sit around and wait until the world warms up more than it has warmed up since there have been humans around -- fine. But I would like to have a shot at avoiding it.''
  Most everybody else seemed content to sit around. Some of the attendees confused uncertainty around the margins of the issue (whether warming would be three or four degrees Celsius in 50 or 75 years) for uncertainty about the severity of the problem. As Gordon MacDonald liked to say, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would rise; the only question was when. The lag between the emission of a gas and the warming it produced could be several decades. It was like adding an extra blanket on a mild night: It took a few minutes before you started to sweat.
  Yet Slade, the director of the Energy Department's carbon-dioxide program, considered the lag a saving grace. If changes did not occur for a decade or more, he said, those in the room couldn't be blamed for failing to prevent them. So what was the problem?
  ''You're the problem,'' Pomerance said. Because of the lag between cause and effect, it was unlikely that humankind would detect hard evidence of warming until it was too late to reverse it. The lag would doom them. ''The U.S. has to do something to gain some credibility,'' he said.
  ''So it is a moral stand,'' Slade replied, sensing an advantage.
  ''Call it whatever.'' Besides, Pomerance added, they didn't have to ban coal tomorrow. A pair of modest steps could be taken immediately to show the world that the United States was serious: the implementation of a carbon tax and increased investment in renewable energy. Then the United States could organize an international summit meeting to address climate change. This was his closing plea to the group. The next day, they would have to draft policy proposals.
  But when the group reconvened after breakfast, they immediately became stuck on a sentence in their prefatory paragraph declaring that climatic changes were ''likely to occur.''
  ''Will occur,'' proposed Laurmann, the Stanford engineer.
  ''What about the words: highly likely to occur?'' Scoville asked.
  ''Almost sure,'' said David Rose, the nuclear engineer from M.I.T.
  ''Almost surely,'' another said.
  ''Changes of an undetermined -- ''
  ''Changes as yet of a little-understood nature?''
  ''Highly or extremely likely to occur,'' Pomerance said.
  ''Almost surely to occur?''
  ''No,'' Pomerance said.
  ''I would like to make one statement,'' said Annemarie Crocetti, a public-health scholar who sat on the National Commission on Air Quality and had barely spoken all week. ''I have noticed that very often when we as scientists are cautious in our statements, everybody else misses the point, because they don't understand our qualifications.''
  ''As a nonscientist,'' said Tom McPherson, the congressman, ''I really concur.''
  Yet these two dozen experts, who agreed on the major points and had made a commitment to Congress, could not draft a single paragraph. Hours passed in a hell of fruitless negotiation, self-defeating proposals and impulsive speechifying. Pomerance and Scoville pushed to include a statement calling for the United States to ''sharply accelerate international dialogue,'' but they were sunk by objections and caveats.
  ''It is very emotional,'' Crocetti said, succumbing to her frustration. ''What we have asked is to get people from different disciplines to come together and tell us what you agree on and what your problems are. And you have only made vague statements -- ''
  She was interrupted by Waltz, the economist, who wanted simply to note that climate change would have profound effects. Crocetti waited until he exhausted himself, before resuming in a calm voice. ''All I am asking you to say is: 'We got ourselves a bunch of experts, and by God, they all endorse this point of view and think it is very important. They have disagreements about the details of this and that, but they feel that it behooves us to intervene at this point and try to prevent it.' ''
  They never got to policy proposals. They never got to the second paragraph. The final statement was signed by only the moderator, who phrased it more weakly than the declaration calling for the workshop in the first place. ''The guide I would suggest,'' Jorling wrote, ''is whether we know enough not to recommend changes in existing policy.''
  Pomerance had seen enough. A consensus-based strategy would not work -- could not work -- without American leadership. And the United States wouldn't act unless a strong leader persuaded it to do so -- someone who would speak with authority about the science, demand action from those in power and risk everything in pursuit of justice. Pomerance knew he wasn't that person: He was an organizer, a strategist, a fixer -- which meant he was an optimist and even, perhaps, a romantic. His job was to assemble a movement. And every movement, even one backed by widespread consensus, needed a hero. He just had to find one.
  6.'Otherwise, They'll Gurgle' November 1980-September 1981
  The meeting ended Friday morning. On Tuesday, four days later, Ronald Reagan was elected president. And Rafe Pomerance soon found himself wondering whether what had seemed to have been a beginning had actually been the end.
  After the election, Reagan considered plans to close the Energy Department, increase coal production on federal land and deregulate surface coal mining. Once in office, he appointed James Watt, the president of a legal firm that fought to open public lands to mining and drilling, to run the Interior Department. ''We're deliriously happy,'' the president of the National Coal Association was reported to have said. Reagan preserved the E.P.A. but named as its administrator Anne Gorsuch, an anti-regulation zealot who proceeded to cut the agency's staff and budget by about a quarter. In the midst of this carnage, the Council on Environmental Quality submitted a report to the White House warning that fossil fuels could ''permanently and disastrously'' alter Earth's atmosphere, leading to ''a warming of the Earth, possibly with very serious effects.'' Reagan did not act on the council's advice. Instead, his administration considered eliminating the council.
  At the Pink Palace, Anthony Scoville had said that the problem was not atmospheric but political. That was only half right, Pomerance thought. For behind every political problem, there lay a publicity problem. And the climate crisis had a publicity nightmare. The Florida meeting had failed to prepare a coherent statement, let alone legislation, and now everything was going backward. Even Pomerance couldn't devote much time to climate change; Friends of the Earth was busier than ever. The campaigns to defeat the nominations of James Watt and Anne Gorsuch were just the beginning; there were also efforts to block mining in wilderness areas, maintain the Clean Air Act's standards for air pollutants and preserve funding for renewable energy (Reagan ''has declared open war on solar energy,'' the director of the nation's lead solar-energy research agency said, after he was asked to resign). Reagan appeared determined to reverse the environmental achievements of Jimmy Carter, before undoing those of Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson, John F. Kennedy and, if he could get away with it, Theodore Roosevelt.
  Reagan's violence to environmental regulations alarmed even members of his own party. Senator Robert Stafford, a Vermont Republican and chairman of the committee that held confirmation hearings on Gorsuch, took the unusual step of lecturing her from the dais about her moral obligation to protect the nation's air and water. Watt's plan to open the waters off California for oil drilling was denounced by the state's Republican senator, and Reagan's proposal to eliminate the position of science adviser was roundly derided by the scientists and engineers who advised him during his presidential campaign. When Reagan considered closing the Council on Environmental Quality, its acting chairman, Malcolm Forbes Baldwin, wrote to the vice president and the White House chief of staff begging them to reconsider; in a major speech the same week, ''A Conservative's Program for the Environment,'' Baldwin argued that it was ''time for today's conservatives explicitly to embrace environmentalism.'' Environmental protection was not only good sense. It was good business. What could be more conservative than an efficient use of resources that led to fewer federal subsidies?
  Meanwhile the Charney report continued to vibrate at the periphery of public consciousness. Its conclusions were confirmed by major studies from the Aspen Institute, the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis near Vienna and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Every month or so, nationally syndicated articles appeared summoning apocalypse: ''Another Warning on 'Greenhouse Effect,' '' ''Global Warming Trend 'Beyond Human Experience,' '' ''Warming Trend Could 'Pit Nation Against Nation.' '' People magazine had profiled Gordon MacDonald, photographing him standing on the steps of the Capitol and pointing above his head to the level the water would reach when the polar ice caps melted. ''If Gordon MacDonald is wrong, they'll laugh,'' the article read. ''Otherwise, they'll gurgle.''
  But Pomerance understood that in order to sustain major coverage, you needed major events. Studies were fine; speeches were good; news conferences were better. Hearings, however, were best. The ritual's theatrical trappings -- the members of Congress holding forth on the dais, their aides decorously passing notes, the witnesses sipping nervously from their water glasses, the audience transfixed in the gallery -- offered antagonists, dramatic tension, narrative. But you couldn't have a hearing without a scandal, or at least a scientific breakthrough. And two years after the Charney group met at Woods Hole, it seemed there was no more science to break through.
  It was with a shiver of optimism, then, that Pomerance read on the front page of The New York Times on Aug. 22, 1981, about a forthcoming paper in Science by a team of seven NASA scientists. They had found that the world had already warmed in the past century. Temperatures hadn't increased beyond the range of historical averages, but the scientists predicted that the warming signal would emerge from the noise of routine weather fluctuations much sooner than previously expected. Most unusual of all, the paper ended with a policy recommendation: In the coming decades, the authors wrote, humankind should develop alternative sources of energy and use fossil fuels only ''as necessary.'' The lead author was James Hansen.
  Pomerance called Hansen to ask for a meeting. He explained to Hansen that he wanted to make sure he understood the paper's conclusions. But more than that, he wanted to understand James Hansen.
  At the Goddard Institute, Pomerance entered Hansen's office, maneuvering through some 30 piles of documents arrayed across the floor like the skyscrapers of a model city, some as high as his waist. On top of many of the stacks lay a scrap of cardboard on which had been scrawled words like Trace Gases, Ocean, Jupiter, Venus. At the desk, Pomerance found, hidden behind another paper metropolis, a quiet, composed man with a heavy brow and implacable green eyes. Hansen's speech was soft, equable, deliberate to the point of halting. He would have no trouble passing for a small-town accountant, insurance-claims manager or actuary. In a sense he held all of those jobs, only his client was the global atmosphere. Pomerance's political sensitivities sparked. He liked what he saw.
  As Hansen spoke, Pomerance listened and watched. He understood Hansen's basic findings well enough: Earth had been warming since 1880, and the warming would reach ''almost unprecedented magnitude'' in the next century, leading to the familiar suite of terrors, including the flooding of a 10th of New Jersey and a quarter of Louisiana and Florida. But Pomerance was excited to find that Hansen could translate the complexities of atmospheric science into plain English. Though he was something of a wunderkind -- at 40, he was about to be named director of the Goddard Institute -- he spoke with the plain-spoken Midwestern forthrightness that played on Capitol Hill. He presented like a heartland voter, the kind of man interviewed on the evening news about the state of the American dream or photographed in the dying sun against a blurry agricultural landscape in a campaign ad. And unlike most scientists in the field, he was not afraid to follow his research to its policy implications. He was perfect.
  ''What you have to say needs to be heard,'' Pomerance said. ''Are you willing to be a witness?''
  7.'We're All GoingTo Be the Victims' March 1982
  Though few people other than Rafe Pomerance seemed to have noticed amid Reagan's environmental blitzkrieg, another hearing on the greenhouse effect was held several weeks earlier, on July 31, 1981. It was led by Representative James Scheuer, a New York Democrat -- who lived at sea level on the Rockaway Peninsula, in a neighborhood no more than four blocks wide, sandwiched between two beaches -- and a canny, 33-year-old congressman named Albert Gore Jr.
  Gore had learned about climate change a dozen years earlier as an undergraduate at Harvard, when he took a class taught by Roger Revelle. Humankind was on the brink of radically transforming the global atmosphere, Revelle explained, drawing Keeling's rising zigzag on the blackboard, and risked bringing about the collapse of civilization. Gore was stunned: Why wasn't anyone talking about this? He had no memory of hearing it from his father, a three-term senator from Tennessee who later served as chairman of an Ohio coal company. Once in office, Gore figured that if Revelle gave Congress the same lecture, his colleagues would be moved to act. Or at least that the hearing would get picked up by one of the three major national news broadcasts.
  Gore's hearing was part of a larger campaign he had designed with his staff director, Tom Grumbly. After winning his third term in 1980, Gore was granted his first leadership position, albeit a modest one: chairman of an oversight subcommittee within the Committee on Science and Technology -- a subcommittee that he had lobbied to create. Most in Congress considered the science committee a legislative backwater, if they considered it at all; this made Gore's subcommittee, which had no legislative authority, an afterthought to an afterthought. That, Gore vowed, would change. Environmental and health stories had all the elements of narrative drama: villains, victims and heroes. In a hearing, you could summon all three, with the chairman serving as narrator, chorus and moral authority. He told his staff director that he wanted to hold a hearing every week.
  It was like storyboarding episodes of a weekly procedural drama. Grumbly assembled a list of subjects that possessed the necessary dramatic elements: a Massachusetts cancer researcher who faked his results, the dangers of excessive salt in the American diet, the disappearance of an airplane on Long Island. All fit Gore's template; all had sizzle. But Gore wondered why Grumbly hadn't included the greenhouse effect.
  There are no villains, Grumbly said. Besides, who's your victim?
  If we don't do something, Gore replied, we're all going to be the victims.
  He didn't say: If we don't do something, we'll be the villains too.
  The Revelle hearing went as Grumbly had predicted. The urgency of the issue was lost on Gore's older colleagues, who drifted in and out while the witnesses testified. There were few people left by the time the Brookings Institution economist Lester Lave warned that humankind's profligate exploitation of fossil fuels posed an existential test to human nature. ''Carbon dioxide stands as a symbol now of our willingness to confront the future,'' he said. ''It will be a sad day when we decide that we just don't have the time or thoughtfulness to address those issues.'' That night, the news programs featured the resolution of the baseball strike, the ongoing budgetary debate and the national surplus of butter.
  But Gore soon found another opening. Congressional staff members on the science committee heard that the White House planned to eliminate the Energy Department's carbon-dioxide program. If they could put a hearing together quickly enough, they could shame the White House before it could go through with its plan. The Times article about Hansen's paper had proved that there was a national audience for the carbon-dioxide problem -- it just had to be framed correctly. Hansen could occupy the role of hero: a mild-mannered scientist who had seen the future and now sought to rouse the world to action. A villain was emerging, too: Fred Koomanoff, Reagan's new director of the Energy Department's carbon-dioxide program, a Bronx native with the manner of a sergeant major and an unconstrained passion for budget-cutting. Each man would testify.
  Hansen did not disclose to Gore's staff that, in late November, he received a letter from Koomanoff declining to fund his climate-modeling research despite a promise from Koomanoff's predecessor. Koomanoff left open the possibility of funding other carbon-dioxide research, but Hansen was not optimistic, and when his funding lapsed, he had to release five employees, half his staff. Koomanoff, it seemed, would not be moved. But the hearing would give Hansen the chance to appeal directly to the congressmen who oversaw Koomanoff's budget.
  Hansen flew to Washington to testify on March 25, 1982, performing before a gallery even more thinly populated than at Gore's first hearing on the greenhouse effect. Gore began by attacking the Reagan administration for cutting funding for carbon-dioxide research despite the ''broad consensus in the scientific community that the greenhouse effect is a reality.'' William Carney, a Republican from New York, bemoaned the burning of fossil fuels and argued passionately that science should serve as the basis for legislative policy. Bob Shamansky, a Democrat from Ohio, objected to the use of the term ''greenhouse effect'' for such a horrifying phenomenon, because he had always enjoyed visiting greenhouses. ''Everything,'' he said, ''seems to flourish in there.'' He suggested that they call it the ''microwave oven'' effect, ''because we are not flourishing too well under this; apparently, we are getting cooked.''
  There emerged, despite the general comity, a partisan divide. Unlike the Democrats, the Republicans demanded action. ''Today I have a sense of déjà vu,'' said Robert Walker, a Republican from Pennsylvania. In each of the last five years, he said, ''we have been told and told and told that there is a problem with the increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We all accept that fact, and we realize that the potential consequences are certainly major in their impact on mankind.'' Yet they had failed to propose a single law. ''Now is the time,'' he said. ''The research is clear. It is up to us now to summon the political will.''
  Gore disagreed: A higher degree of certainty was required, he believed, in order to persuade a majority of Congress to restrict the use of fossil fuels. The reforms required were of such magnitude and sweep that they ''would challenge the political will of our civilization.''
  Yet the experts invited by Gore agreed with the Republicans: The science was certain enough. Melvin Calvin, a Berkeley chemist who won the Nobel Prize for his work on the carbon cycle, said that it was useless to wait for stronger evidence of warming. ''You cannot do a thing about it when the signals are so big that they come out of the noise,'' he said. ''You have to look for early warning signs.''
  Hansen's job was to share the warning signs, to translate the data into plain English. He explained a few discoveries that his team had made -- not with computer models but in libraries. By analyzing records from hundreds of weather stations, he found that the surface temperature of the planet had already increased four-tenths of a degree Celsius in the previous century. Data from several hundred tide-gauge stations showed that the oceans had risen four inches since the 1880s. Most disturbing of all, century-old glass astronomy plates had revealed a new problem: Some of the more obscure greenhouse gases -- especially chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, a class of man-made substances used in refrigerators and spray cans -- had proliferated wildly in recent years. ''We may already have in the pipeline a larger amount of climate change than people generally realize,'' Hansen told the nearly empty room.
  Gore asked when the planet would reach a point of no return -- a ''trigger point,'' after which temperatures would spike. ''I want to know,'' Gore said, ''whether I am going to face it or my kids are going to face it.''
  ''Your kids are likely to face it,'' Calvin replied. ''I don't know whether you will or not. You look pretty young.''
  It occurred to Hansen that this was the only political question that mattered: How long until the worst began? It was not a question on which geophysicists expended much effort; the difference between five years and 50 years in the future was meaningless in geologic time. Politicians were capable of thinking only in terms of electoral time: six years, four years, two years. But when it came to the carbon problem, the two time schemes were converging.
  ''Within 10 or 20 years,'' Hansen said, ''we will see climate changes which are clearly larger than the natural variability.''
  James Scheuer wanted to make sure he understood this correctly. No one else had predicted that the signal would emerge that quickly. ''If it were one or two degrees per century,'' he said, ''that would be within the range of human adaptability. But we are pushing beyond the range of human adaptability.''
  ''Yes,'' Hansen said.
  How soon, Scheuer asked, would they have to change the national model of energy production?
  Hansen hesitated -- it wasn't a scientific question. But he couldn't help himself. He had been irritated, during the hearing, by all the ludicrous talk about the possibility of growing more trees to offset emissions. False hopes were worse than no hope at all: They undermined the prospect of developing real solutions.
  ''That time is very soon,'' Hansen said finally.
  ''My opinion is that it is past,'' Calvin said, but he was not heard because he spoke from his seat. He was told to speak into the microphone.
  ''It is already later,'' Calvin said, ''than you think.''
  8.'The Direction of an Impending Catastrophe' 1982
  From Gore's perspective, the hearing was an unequivocal success. That night Dan Rather devoted three minutes of ''CBS Evening News'' to the greenhouse effect. A correspondent explained that temperatures had increased over the previous century, great sheets of pack ice in Antarctica were rapidly melting, the seas were rising; Calvin said that ''the trend is all in the direction of an impending catastrophe''; and Gore mocked Reagan for his shortsightedness. Later, Gore could take credit for protecting the Energy Department's carbon-dioxide program, which in the end was largely preserved.
  But Hansen did not get new funding for his carbon-dioxide research. He wondered whether he had been doomed by his testimony or by his conclusion, in the Science paper, that full exploitation of coal resources -- a stated goal of Reagan's energy policy -- was ''undesirable.'' Whatever the cause, he found himself alone. He knew he had done nothing wrong -- he had only done diligent research and reported his findings, first to his peers, then to the American people. But now it seemed as if he was being punished for it.
  Anniek could read his disappointment, but she was not entirely displeased. Jim cut down on his work hours, leaving the Goddard Institute at 5 o'clock each day, which allowed him to coach his children's basketball and baseball teams. (He was a patient, committed coach, detail-oriented, if a touch too competitive for his wife's liking.) At home, Jim spoke only about the teams and their fortunes, keeping to himself his musings -- whether he would be able to secure federal funding for his climate experiments, whether the institute would be forced to move its office to Maryland to cut costs.
  But perhaps there were other ways forward. Not long after Hansen laid off five of his assistants, a major symposium he was helping to organize received overtures from a funding partner far wealthier and less ideologically blinkered than the Reagan administration: Exxon. Following Henry Shaw's recommendation to establish credibility ahead of any future legislative battles, Exxon had begun to spend conspicuously on global-warming research. It donated tens of thousands of dollars to some of the most prominent research efforts, including one at Woods Hole led by the ecologist George Woodwell, who had been calling for major climate policy as early as the mid-1970s, and an international effort coordinated by the United Nations. Now Shaw offered to fund the October 1982 symposium on climate change at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty campus.
  As an indication of the seriousness with which Exxon took the issue, Shaw sent Edward David Jr., the president of the research division and the former science adviser to Nixon. Hansen was glad for the support. He figured that Exxon's contributions might go well beyond picking up the bill for travel expenses, lodging and a dinner for dozens of scientists at the colonial-style Clinton Inn in Tenafly, N.J. As a gesture of appreciation, David was invited to give the keynote address.
  There were moments in David's speech in which he seemed to channel Rafe Pomerance. David boasted that Exxon would usher in a new global energy system to save the planet from the ravages of climate change. He went so far as to argue that capitalism's blind faith in the wisdom of the free market was ''less than satisfying'' when it came to the greenhouse effect. Ethical considerations were necessary, too. He pledged that Exxon would revise its corporate strategy to account for climate change, even if it were not ''fashionable'' to do so. As Exxon had already made heavy investments in nuclear and solar technology, he was ''generally upbeat'' that Exxon would ''invent'' a future of renewable energy.
  Hansen had reason to feel upbeat himself. If the world's largest oil-and-gas company supported a new national energy model, the White House would not stand in its way. The Reagan administration was hostile to change from within its ranks. But it couldn't be hostile to Exxon.
  It seemed that something was beginning to turn. With the carbon-dioxide problem as with other environmental crises, the Reagan administration had alienated many of its own supporters. The early demonstrations of autocratic force had retreated into compromise and deference. By the end of 1982, multiple congressional committees were investigating Anne Gorsuch for her indifference to enforcing the cleanup of Superfund sites, and the House voted to hold her in contempt of Congress; Republicans in Congress turned on James Watt after he eliminated thousands of acres of land from consideration for wilderness designation. Each cabinet member would resign within a year.
  The carbon-dioxide issue was beginning to receive major national attention -- Hansen's own findings had become front-page news, after all. What started as a scientific story was turning into a political story. This prospect would have alarmed Hansen several years earlier; it still made him uneasy. But he was beginning to understand that politics offered freedoms that the rigors of the scientific ethic denied. The political realm was itself a kind of Mirror World, a parallel reality that crudely mimicked our own. It shared many of our most fundamental laws, like the laws of gravity and inertia and publicity. And if you applied enough pressure, the Mirror World of politics could be sped forward to reveal a new future. Hansen was beginning to understand that too.

Correction Appended
Climate change is essentially tied with the Islamic State as the most-feared security threat across much of the world — except in the United States, where cyberattacks are considered a greater danger than global warming, according to a            Pew Research Center report released on Tuesday.
Residents of 13 countries ranked climate change as the greatest threat to national security, while in 17 countries the Islamic State was considered a more immediate problem.
In the United States, however, a gaping partisan divide pushed climate change to third-most severe perceived threat, after ISIS and cyberwarfare. Just 56 percent of Americans surveyed identified global warming as the most serious threat to the country, compared to 71 percent for cyberwarfare and 74 percent for Islamic State attacks.
The American intelligence community concluded that Russia used cyberweapons to interfere with the presidential election last year, perhaps accounting for the heightened sense of threat. The Trump administration has consistently played down the dangers of a warming climate and has withdrawn the United States from the Paris accord on climate change signed by nearly 200 nations.
Jacob Poushter, Pew’s senior researcher and a co-author of the study, said that in most countries terrorism and climate change were seen as the most pressing dangers. The United States was an exception, he said.
“The stark partisan divide between those on the left and the right means there is a large portion in the United States that doesn’t see climate change as a threat,” Mr. Poushter said. “But there’s a large percentage that does, so that lowers the number.”
The survey of 41,953 people in 38 countries was conducted from February through May. Beyond the top line figures, the survey offers other insights about how people around the world view global warming.
Latin America is deeply worried about climate change
While Latin America is certainly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change, its countries rarely rank among the most at risk. That unfortunate distinction tends to go to Chad, Sudan, low-lying island states and other places where poverty and civil strife meet rising seas, floods and drought. So it’s not surprising, perhaps, to see so many countries in Africa put climate change at the top of their worry lists.
But 74 percent of people surveyed in seven South American and Latin American countries cite climate as their top global concern, the highest of any region surveyed.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change offers some clues, citing “significant trends in precipitation and temperature” across the region.            Paula Caballero, global director of the climate change program at the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based think tank, noted the multiple            devastating floods this spring in her native Colombia.
“In Latin America the impacts of climate change both in terms of extreme events as well as the intensity and frequency of events has really gained momentum,” said Ms. Caballero, who formerly served as Colombia’s lead United Nations negotiator on climate change.
Even in Venezuela, the only Latin American country surveyed that did not name climate change as its top concern, global warming came in just below worries about the economy. In the midst of its own political and economic crisis last month, Venezuelan leaders ratified the Paris Agreement.
Russians are among the least concerned about warming
The Russian heat wave of 2010 was made three times more likely by climate change, a studylater found. But Russians are generally apathetic about rising greenhouse gas emissions, the Pew survey confirmed. The country backed the Paris agreement on climate change but the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, did not denounce President Trump for abandoning the accord, as so many other world leaders did.
Mr. Putin’s views on the subject are opaque, though. Before the Paris accords he told world leaders that global warming “was one of the gravest challenges humanity is facing.”
Russia ranked climate change fifth among its global concerns in the Pew survey, below the Islamic State, the economy, the refugee crisis and the influence of the United States.
What do the Russians worry about even less than climate change? Cyberattacks.
American opinion on climate change is highly partisan
We have long known Americans break heavily along party lines over the causes, solutions and very existence of man-made climate change. The Pew study lays that chasm bare.
Among Americans who consider themselves left-leaning, 86 percent cite rising emissions as a dangerous threat, compared with only 31 percent on the right. That 55 percent divide is larger than the partisan split on ISIS and on the migrant crisis.
Terrorism is the biggest worry for Americans, with 74 percent putting ISIS as the top threat to the country. Close behind are cyberattacks.
Mr. Poushter noted the surveys were conducted in the spring amid national attention on the finding that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election by hacking Democrats’ emails and distributing online propaganda.
Climate change is ranked third among Americans, with 56 percent of people surveyed believing it is a major threat.
Lower levels of concern about climate change were found in Poland, Russia, India, Israel Jordan, Tunisia, Turkey, Ghana, Nigeria and Venezuela.
Anthony           Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication at Yale University, said the ideological split in America underscores the divisions he has witnessed in his own studies of how Americans perceive climate change.
“Climate change is in many ways a small skirmish in the midst of a much larger political struggle that’s been going on in this country since its founding,” he said. “What’s the relationship between government and a society of free individuals? That’s playing out across the board on a lot of other issues, from tax policy to health care.”
Coal importers and exporters have divergent views
Pew did not survey many of the top oil exporters other than Russia, so it’s hard to know how people feel in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates or Kuwait. But among the world’s biggest coal exporters the story is a fairly nuanced one.
Citizens of Indonesia, a top coal exporter in 2014, according to the World Coal Association, listed ISIS as their highest concern.            Attacks in Jakarta this spring have set people on edge, and the country’s military chief has warned that the Islamic State group has so-called sleeper cells all over the country. But climate is still seen as the third biggest threat, after the economy. Australia, also a coal-exporting giant, cited climate change as the second greatest threat after ISIS.
And among the big coal importers? Only 47 percent of people in India surveyed named climate change as a top concern, but that was enough to put the issue second after ISIS. In South Korea, 79 percent of people are worried about the climate.
Mr. Poushter said Pew did not survey China this year because of a law restricting research by foreign organizations. But            a similar survey Pew conducted in 2015 found 19 percent of Chinese people polled considered themselves “very concerned” about climate change. That is low, particularly compared with the 79 percent of Indians who were very concerned about warming at the time. But it also was the highest level of worry Chinese residents assigned to any global threat.

You might be surprised: Protecting peat bogs could help the world avert the worst effects of global warming, a new study has found.
Protecting intact peatlands and restoring degraded ones are crucial steps if the world is to counter climate change, European researchers said Friday. 
  In a study, they said peat bogs, wetlands that contain large amounts of carbon in the form of decaying vegetation that has built up over centuries, could help the world achieve climate goals like the limit of 2 degrees Celsius of postindustrial warming that is part of the 2015 Paris agreement.
  But without protection and restoration efforts, some targets for greenhouse gas emissions ''would be very difficult or nearly impossible to achieve,'' said Alexander Popp, an author of the study, which was published in Environmental Research Letters. Dr. Popp is a senior scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, where he leads a group studying land-use issues.
  Peatlands exist around the world, in tropical as well as colder regions. They make up only about 3 percent of global land area, but their deep layers of peat are practically treasure chests of carbon, overall containing roughly twice as much as the world's forests.
  In pristine bogs, that carbon remains soggy and intact. But when a bog is dried out, for agriculture or other reasons, the carbon starts to oxidize and is released to the atmosphere as planet-warming carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
  That process potentially can continue for centuries. Current estimates are that drained peatlands worldwide emit as much carbon dioxide annually as global air travel.
  But dry peat is also a fire risk, and peat fires have the potential to release a lot of carbon very quickly. In September and October 2015, peat fires in Indonesia, where bogs have long been drained for palm oil plantations and other purposes, released more carbon dioxide per day than all the fossil fuels burned in the European Union.
  Dried peatlands could be restored by allowing them to become wet again, which would saturate the decaying vegetation and prevent further release of carbon dioxide, and also eliminate the fire hazard.
  ''Rewetting them is really the core for reaching mitigation targets,'' Dr. Popp said.
  Most pathways for countering climate change predict that by the end of this century, land use, which includes forests and agriculture, would be a net carbon sink, meaning it would store more carbon than the amount being released to the atmosphere. That would slow the process of global warming.
  But most of those pathways do not take emissions from degraded peatland into account, the researchers said. When they plugged peatland data into their own land-use model, they found that land use would be a net carbon source, releasing more carbon dioxide than was stored.
  The researchers then calculated that protecting pristine wetlands and rewetting about 60 percent of the degraded ones would reverse that, making land use a net sink again.
  Mike Waddington, a peat researcher at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, who was not involved in the work, said the study ''makes a very compelling case'' in favor of restoring peatlands.
  ''Despite covering a small area, they really pack a carbon punch when it comes to carbon storage in ecosystems,'' Dr. Waddington said. ''They are really important in global climate regulation.''
  He said the study made an important point: In current pathways for changing land use to aid the climate, through planting more trees or other measures, peatlands are often considered expendable.
  ''When we think about storing carbon in ecosystems, it's almost always about planting trees,'' Dr. Waddington said. There's often tremendous pressure to plant trees in drained peatlands, he said, but that's the wrong choice given the carbon-storing ability of an intact bog.
  Peat bogs are usually dried by digging ditches through them, which allows the water to drain away. In addition to conversion to croplands, tree plantations or forests, some peatlands are drained so the peat can be extracted for use in horticulture or even, in some parts of the world, for fuel.
  ''You only have to drain 10 to 15 percent of a peatland and start extracting peat to turn that entire system into a source,'' Dr. Waddington said.
  Restoring them could be accomplished by blocking the ditches or building berms to keep the peat saturated, he said.
  In the study, the researchers found that there was considerable uncertainty in estimates of the costs of protecting and restoring peatlands. But even if the costs were at the high end, the basic finding of the research was unchanged, they said.
  ''In a way it's the low-hanging fruit,'' Dr. Waddington said.

This article is part of a continuing series on Visionaries. The New York Times selected people from all over the world who are pushing the boundaries of their fields, from science and technology to culture and sports.
When policymakers, financiers and scientists describe the world decades from now, in the throes of climatic changes that we now only model, they emphasize what might be lost. They discuss the threats to gross domestic product, the            havoc wrought by natural disasters or the runaway greenhouse gas emissions released by            emerging national economies.
To Narasimha Rao, a professor at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies specializing in energy systems analysis, that is a false choice, one that sacrifices justice on the altar of economic growth.
So far, the global economy has not been able to fully decouple growth in G.D.P. from growth in greenhouse gas emissions. That relationship portends doom for a planet trying to keep emissions in check in order to avoid global catastrophe and also for emerging economies — mainly in the global south — working to lift millions out of poverty, and to achieve the levels of growth and success that the United States and much of the West have experienced.
But through his research, Mr. Rao, who also has appointments at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria and the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment in India, has found that we don’t need to choose. Instead, he has developed theDecent Living Energy Project, an assessment of both the energy needs in select emerging economies and the climate impacts of providing everyone in those same economies with a basic living standard. This standard would largely be defined by access to adequate nutrition, safe homes with sanitation and basic amenities such as refrigeration, mobility, education and basic health care.
“The dominant discourse in climate change and energy transitions equates well-being to G.D.P., and we need to move beyond that.”
His research shows that reducing inequality — within countries and between them — would improve our ability to mitigate some of the worst effects of climate change, and provide for a more stable climate future. Fundamentally, for Mr. Rao, climate change, at its most essential, is a justice issue. 
The following conversation has been edited and condensed.
How have your views about climate change, mitigation strategies and different levels of global responsibility changed over time?
I started out with a more technical background. I was an engineer, and I was drawn to some of the, in my mind, unresolved justice issues about sharing the burden of climate change. Going back to when I didn’t have a good appreciation for what the energy transition entails, it came to me that emerging economies have a particularly difficult dilemma that often doesn’t resolve very well in academic discourse.
They have what appear to be conflicting demands — growing, increasing energy use, raising living standards that could, at the same time, lead to calamitous contributions to climate change if we keep going along the same lines. How do you deal with mitigating climate and ensuring international justice as well as justice within these countries?
There is a big disconnect between global scenarios of mitigation and international discourse. There are idealized assumptions about what needs to happen while little on the ground reflects those directions of change.
“We are not going to pursue these completely transformative changes without thinking about sharing efforts.”
What are the major cultural shifts that need to happen to enable those changes?
If we are to really get to the level of mitigation that the Paris agreement calls for, it can only happen with increased attention to equity. We are not going to pursue these completely transformative changes without thinking about sharing efforts, and I see that requiring changes in the international sphere.
We need to look more rigorously at the basic requirements of human well-being and human progress. We know what they are in economics and social policy, but we don’t know how to align those requirements with climate change and energy use. The dominant discourse in climate change and energy transitions equates well-being to G.D.P., and we need to move beyond that.
What are the obstacles in getting people to understand those changes?
The models presume that welfare is driven by G.D.P. growth, for example, and that’s an important principle that’s embedded within them. They rarely model distributions or heterogeneity of populations, so you’re looking at aggregate outcomes and ignoring inequalities in society, and that ignores a lot of the problem.
We think about India and the U.S. as big emitters without thinking that India has to invest in advanced low-carbon technologies with a fraction of the income of the U.S. and to serve several hundred million in poverty.
What inspired you to go into your field?
Besides addressing what I thought was an unanswered justice question, Steve Schneider was a real inspiration to me. He was at Stanford, and was a climate scientist who was a really good communicator, who understand not only the science but also the ethics and morality of the science.
There was also a team of energy researchers from four continents who started to think about energy needs and technology leapfrogging, after the oil crises triggered concerns of energy scarcity and limits to growth. That work influenced me a lot.
And I was inspired a lot by Amartya Sen’s philosophy, in terms of thinking about well-being, but in general I am very much motivated by the need for interdisciplinary thinking about this problem which involves science, ethics, sociology and economics all together, and I think there are very few people who can cross those boundaries.
“From the age of 14, I was struck by poverty, and I wanted to do something to get rid of it.”
What did you want to be when you were a kid?
I grew up in Mumbai in India, for my first 16 years, and I grew up in a middle-class family, but I was exposed to poverty around me. Being an Indian, if you do well at school, you focus on science and engineering. But I was always drawn to the social sciences because that’s where I thought a lot of our problems and solutions lay.
From the age of 14, I was struck by poverty, and I wanted to do something to get rid of it. What I wanted to be was — I don’t know how to define it, but somebody who would work to eradicate poverty. I thought it was through education at the time, but that was just a 14-year-old’s thinking.
Where do you find sources of creativity?
Music on a more personal level encourages the mental peace that brings creative ideas, but for me it’s operating in the space between disciplines. I borrow a phrase from Mr. Schneider that operating at the margins of disciplines and looking at the bridges between them — that’s my source of creativity.
How does technology interact with your profession?
My view is that technology is essential, but not the primary barrier to the energy transition. We need the right incentives to guide its development with a sense of purpose, and that purpose needs to be the public good. A lot of technological developments are driven by developers without regard to their long-term consequences for society.
“We haven’t really explored enough the benefits to our well-being of a low-carbon lifestyle.”
Discussions of climate change have often focused on sacrifice and loss as opposed to the benefits of a lower-carbon lifestyle. Is it possible to shift that way of thinking?
In some ways, the costs of reducing climate change are overstated. We haven’t really explored enough the benefits to our well-being of a low-carbon lifestyle, and this is one of the biases I see in the research: that risky technologies are the only ways to address climate change.
If you think about more public transit, more sustainable diets, more high-tech communities with perhaps more modest homes, these are things that can benefit people in the future, and likewise, I think in developing countries it will also require a shift away from present trends.
What are some of the more positive developments that you’ve seen in the climate movement recently?
It’s really the groundswell of public movement all over the world, most recently in the last few weeks. To me that’s the kind of pressure we need on politicians. We’ve been talking about this until now in a normative and academic sense, but climate action is largely a political problem.

You might be surprised: Protecting peat bogs could help the world avert the worst effects of global warming, a new study has found.
Protecting intact peatlands and restoring degraded ones are crucial steps if the world is to counter climate change, European researchers said Friday.
In a study, they said peat bogs, wetlands that contain large amounts of carbon in the form of decaying vegetation that has built up over centuries, could help the world achieve climate goals like the limit of 2 degrees Celsius of postindustrial warming that is part of the 2015 Paris agreement.
But without protection and restoration efforts, some targets for greenhouse gas emissions “would be very difficult or nearly impossible to achieve,” said Alexander Popp, an author of the study, which was published in Environmental Research Letters. Dr. Popp is a senior scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, where he leads a group studying land-use issues.
Peatlands exist around the world, in tropical as well as colder regions. They make up only about 3 percent of global land area, but their deep layers of peat are practically treasure chests of carbon, overall containing roughly twice as much as the world’s forests.
In pristine bogs, that carbon remains soggy and intact. But when a bog is dried out, for agriculture or other reasons, the carbon starts to oxidize and is released to the atmosphere as planet-warming carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
That process potentially can continue for centuries. Current estimates are that drained peatlands worldwide emit as much carbon dioxide annually as global air travel.
But dry peat is also a fire risk, and peat fires have the potential to release a lot of carbon very quickly. In September and October 2015, peat fires in Indonesia, where bogs have long been drained for palm oil plantations and other purposes, released more carbon dioxide per day than all the fossil fuels burned in the European Union.
Dried peatlands could be restored by allowing them to become wet again, which would saturate the decaying vegetation and prevent further release of carbon dioxide, and also eliminate the fire hazard.
“Rewetting them is really the core for reaching mitigation targets,” Dr. Popp said.
Most pathways for countering climate change predict that by the end of this century, land use, which includes forests and agriculture, would be a net carbon sink, meaning it would store more carbon than the amount being released to the atmosphere. That would slow the process of global warming.
But most of those pathways do not take emissions from degraded peatland into account, the researchers said. When they plugged peatland data into their own land-use model, they found that land use would be a net carbon source, releasing more carbon dioxide than was stored.
The researchers then calculated that protecting pristine wetlands and rewetting about 60 percent of the degraded ones would reverse that, making land use a net sink again.
Mike Waddington, a peat researcher at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, who was not involved in the work, said the study “makes a very compelling case” in favor of restoring peatlands.
“Despite covering a small area, they really pack a carbon punch when it comes to carbon storage in ecosystems,” Dr. Waddington said. “They are really important in global climate regulation.”
He said the study made an important point: In current pathways for changing land use to aid the climate, through planting more trees or other measures, peatlands are often considered expendable.
“When we think about storing carbon in ecosystems, it’s almost always about planting trees,” Dr. Waddington said. There’s often tremendous pressure to plant trees in drained peatlands, he said, but that’s the wrong choice given the carbon-storing ability of an intact bog.
Peat bogs are usually dried by digging ditches through them, which allows the water to drain away. In addition to conversion to croplands, tree plantations or forests, some peatlands are drained so the peat can be extracted for use in horticulture or even, in some parts of the world, for fuel.
“You only have to drain 10 to 15 percent of a peatland and start extracting peat to turn that entire system into a source,” Dr. Waddington said.
Restoring them could be accomplished by blocking the ditches or building berms to keep the peat saturated, he said.
In the study, the researchers found that there was considerable uncertainty in estimates of the costs of protecting and restoring peatlands. But even if the costs were at the high end, the basic finding of the research was unchanged, they said.
“In a way it’s the low-hanging fruit,” Dr. Waddington said.

Climate Change and ISIS Are Seen in Poll as World's Greatest Threats


 



Climate Change and ISIS Are Seen in Poll as World's Greatest Threats

Climate change is essentially tied with the Islamic State as the most-feared security threat across much of the world -- except in the United States, where cyberattacks are considered a greater danger than global warming, according to a Pew Research Center report released on Tuesday.
Residents of 13 countries ranked climate change as the greatest threat to national security, while in 17 countries the Islamic State was considered a more immediate problem. 
  In the United States, however, a gaping partisan divide pushed climate change to third-most severe perceived threat, after ISIS and cyberwarfare. Just 56 percent of Americans surveyed identified global warming as the most serious threat to the country, compared to 71 percent for cyberwarfare and 74 percent for Islamic State attacks.
  The American intelligence community concluded that Russia used cyberweapons to interfere with the presidential election last year, perhaps accounting for the heightened sense of threat. The Trump administration has consistently played down the dangers of a warming climate and has withdrawn the United States from the Paris accord on climate change signed by nearly 200 nations.
  Jacob Poushter, Pew's senior researcher and a co-author of the study, said that in most countries terrorism and climate change were seen as the most pressing dangers. The United States was an exception, he said.
  ''The stark partisan divide between those on the left and the right means there is a large portion in the United States that doesn't see climate change as a threat,'' Mr. Poushter said. ''But there's a large percentage that does, so that lowers the number.''
  The survey of 41,953 people in 38 countries was conducted from February through May. Beyond the top line figures, the survey offers other insights about how people around the world view global warming.
  Latin America is deeply worried about climate change
  While Latin America is certainly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change, its countries rarely rank among the most at risk. That unfortunate distinction tends to go to Chad, Sudan, low-lying island states and other places where poverty and civil strife meet rising seas, floods and drought. So it's not surprising, perhaps, to see so many countries in Africa put climate change at the top of their worry lists.
  But 74 percent of people surveyed in seven South American and Latin American countries cite climate as their top global concern, the highest of any region surveyed.
  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change offers some clues, citing ''significant trends in precipitation and temperature'' across the region. Paula Caballero, global director of the climate change program at the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based think tank, noted the multiple devastating floods this spring in her native Colombia.
  ''In Latin America the impacts of climate change both in terms of extreme events as well as the intensity and frequency of events has really gained momentum,'' said Ms. Caballero, who formerly served as Colombia's lead United Nations negotiator on climate change.
  Even in Venezuela, the only Latin American country surveyed that did not name climate change as its top concern, global warming came in just below worries about the economy. In the midst of its own political and economic crisis last month, Venezuelan leaders ratified the Paris Agreement.
  Russians are among the least concerned about warming
  The Russian heat wave of 2010 was made three times more likely by climate change, a  study later found. But Russians are generally apathetic about rising greenhouse gas emissions, the Pew survey confirmed. The country backed the Paris agreement on climate change but the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, did not denounce President Trump for abandoning the accord, as so many other world leaders did.
  Mr. Putin's views on the subject are opaque, though. Before the Paris accords he told world leaders that global warming ''was one of the gravest challenges humanity is facing.''
  Russia ranked climate change fifth among its global concerns in the Pew survey, below the Islamic State, the economy, the refugee crisis and the influence of the United States.
  What do the Russians worry about even less than climate change? Cyberattacks.
  American opinion on climate change is highly partisan
  We have long known Americans break heavily along party lines over the causes, solutions and very existence of man-made climate change. The Pew study lays that chasm bare.
  Among Americans who consider themselves left-leaning, 86 percent cite rising emissions as a dangerous threat, compared with only 31 percent on the right. That 55 percent divide is larger than the partisan split on ISIS and on the migrant crisis.
  Terrorism is the biggest worry for Americans, with 74 percent putting ISIS as the top threat to the country. Close behind are cyberattacks.
  Mr. Poushter noted the surveys were conducted in the spring amid national attention on the finding that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election by hacking Democrats' emails and distributing online propaganda.
  Climate change is ranked third among Americans, with 56 percent of people surveyed believing it is a major threat.
  Lower levels of concern about climate change were found in Poland, Russia, India, Israel Jordan, Tunisia, Turkey, Ghana, Nigeria and Venezuela.
  Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication at Yale University, said the ideological split in America underscores the divisions he has witnessed in his own studies of how Americans perceive climate change.
  ''Climate change is in many ways a small skirmish in the midst of a much larger political struggle that's been going on in this country since its founding,'' he said. ''What's the relationship between government and a society of free individuals? That's playing out across the board on a lot of other issues, from tax policy to health care.''
  Coal importers and exporters have divergent views
  Pew did not survey many of the top oil exporters other than Russia, so it's hard to know how people feel in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates or Kuwait. But among the world's biggest coal exporters the story is a fairly nuanced one.
  Citizens of Indonesia, a top coal exporter in 2014, according to the World Coal Association, listed ISIS as their highest concern. Attacks in Jakarta this spring  have set people on edge, and the country's military chief has warned that the Islamic State group has so-called sleeper cells all over the country. But climate is still seen as the third biggest threat, after the economy. Australia, also a coal-exporting giant, cited climate change as the second greatest threat after ISIS.
  And among the big coal importers? Only 47 percent of people in India surveyed named climate change as a top concern, but that was enough to put the issue second after ISIS. In South Korea, 79 percent of people are worried about the climate.
  Mr. Poushter said Pew did not survey China this year because of a law restricting research by foreign organizations. But a similar survey Pew conducted in 2015 found 19 percent of Chinese people polled considered themselves ''very concerned'' about climate change. That is low, particularly compared with the 79 percent of Indians who were very concerned about warming at the time. But it also was the highest level of worry Chinese residents assigned to any global threat.

Selected by the editors of the Books and Climate Desks   Perhaps you prefer reading to escape reality, not confront it. But if the 50th anniversary of Earth Day has inspired you to decide that now's the time to pick up a book about climate change, we're here to help you find the right one for you.
  I don't even know where to start.
  What We Know About Climate Change by Kerry Emanuel
  Nonfiction
  An M.I.T. climatologist and a conservative, Emanuel sounds the alarm in a measured and scientifically sound way, making clear what we know and what we don't know. There is little panic in this slender book, but there is a lot of troubling information.
  Emanuel specifically thought of his book as a way of offering ammunition to those trying to convince family members or friends who are skeptical or don't understand the science.
  ''Young adults who are disputing this problem with their own parents or an uncle or something -- they can hand the book to them and say, 'Will you at least read this?''' Emanuel said in a 2013 interview with The Times. ''One at a time, you might change minds.''
  I just want to understand how we got here.
  The End of Nature by Bill McKibben
  Nonfiction
  McKibben wrote this book in 1989 when global warming was still referred to with the more innocuous sounding phrase ''the greenhouse effect.'' It was an abstract worry in the future even for environmentalists, who were still reeling from the fight to save the ozone layer. For McKibben the crises were connected and spoke to a bigger problem: a disregard for nature and how humans were capable of harming it.
  His book is a lament that nature has lost its independence. Even if everything could be done to stave off warming, McKibben writes, it would have to come from human ingenuity and depend on our intervention into natural processes. This is another sign that we have encroached too far -- that nature itself is over, as McKibben puts it.
  His only solution, one we certainly have not heeded in the decades since, is to take a step back, ''to go no farther down the path we've been following.''
  I'm ready for the hard truth. Don't sugar-coat it.
  The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert
  Nonfiction
  Reporting from the Andes, the Amazon rainforest, the Great Barrier Reef and her own backyard, Kolbert registers the impact of climate change on the life of our planet. What emerges is a picture of the sixth mass extinction, which threatens to eliminate 20 to 50 percent of all species on Earth within this century.
  All the warnings are here, in Kolbert's elegant, accessible prose: sea levels rising, deforestation, the dispersion of disease-carrying species. But she also digs deep, offering an intellectual history of ''extinction'' and placing in context the catastrophes ahead by grappling with how life on Earth ended and was regenerated in the distant past.
  ''By disrupting these systems,'' Kolbert writes, ''we're putting our own survival in danger.''

  Who saw this coming?
  The Drowned World by J.G. Ballard
  Fiction
  With its vision of a London swamped by the rising Thames River and a warming planet leading to an urban landscape of lush tropical foliage, Ballard's dystopian fantasy -- written in 1962 -- laid the groundwork for generations of climate-change fiction to come. The book imagines the dawning of a new geologic age like the one environmentalists now call the Anthropocene, with resulting changes to a broad swath of plant and animal species, humans very much among them.
  The plot involves a looter who refuses to leave London even as the water grows hotter, and an expedition of scientists trying to determine whether civilization might someday take root again. ''But the main action is in the deeper reaches of the mind,'' Kingsley Amis wrote in a 1963 review of the book for The Observer, ''the main merit the extraordinary imaginative power with which whatever inhabits these reaches is externalized in concrete form. The book blazes with images, striking in themselves and yet continuously meaningful.''

  I'm fascinated by how people behave when things get bad.
  The Wall by John Lanchester
  Fiction
  Lanchester's novel, published in 2019, elegantly and chillingly imagines how current political attitudes might play out as the repercussions of climate change grow more severe. With sea levels rising and extreme weather events increasingly common, an island nation that closely resembles Britain has built a concrete wall around its entire perimeter to hold back both the water and the desperate tide of refugees from harder-hit areas.
  The narrator, Joseph Kavanagh, has embarked on his mandatory two-year service as a ''Defender,'' guarding a section of the wall against outsiders even as he falls in love and mulls in restrained language about what the future will bring. That includes the threat of invasion, as a government official tells the Defenders at a pivotal moment: ''The shelter blew away, the waters rose to the higher ground, the ground baked, the crops died, the ledge crumbled, the well dried up. The safety was an illusion. ... The Others are coming.''
  Did we learn anything from Hurricane Katrina?
  Salvage the Bones by Jesmyn Ward
  Fiction
  Set in the days leading up to and immediately after Hurricane Katrina, this National Book Award-winning novel follows a black family in Mississippi as it prepares for, and recovers from, disaster. Esch, a pregnant teenager, is at the center of the story. A fierce, mythology-loving young woman, she's quick to connect the events of her own life with those of the Greeks.
  For all the devastation at its core, this is an insistently hopeful book. As our reviewer put it: ''Like every good myth, at its heart, the book is salvific; it wants to teach you how to wait out the storm and swim to safety.''
  I live on the coast. How scared should I be?
  The Water Will Come by Jeff Goodell
  Nonfiction
  ''Sea-level rise is one of the central facts of our time, as real as gravity,'' Goodell writes at the start of his book, published in 2017. ''It will reshape our world in ways most of us can only dimly imagine.'' This book takes us there, to a place where we can picture Miami completely underwater.
  Goodell, who has written other books about climate change, here travels the world to cities like Lagos, Rotterdam and Venice that are at risk of vanishing if the rise in water levels follows current projections.
  Maybe the most interesting element he explores is people's inability to see the rising tide. Talking to an influential developer in Miami, Goodell asks if he's worried about the future when the ocean takes over. He isn't, he says. ''Besides,'' the developer adds, ''by that time, I'll be dead, so what does it matter?''
  New York is the center of my universe.
  New York 2140 by Kim Stanley Robinson
  Fiction
  It can be easy to forget that the island of Manhattan is just that, an island -- but as rising waters encroach on coastal lands everywhere, life in the city has the potential to change dramatically. Robinson's novel, published in 2017, envisions a financial district with canals in place of streets and an uptown crowded with skyscrapers as the wealthy move to higher ground.
  A thought experiment with an ensemble cast, the novel is less concerned with a conventional plot than with showing a slice of life across various classes, with particular attention to the workings of the economy and other social systems. Maybe the most remarkable feature of the story is how little it imagines life changing, despite the drastically revised landscape: The building super works on repairing submerged apartments, the police inspector looks for missing squatters and the hedge funder bets on mortgages that are (literally) under water.
  What's happening to the Great Lakes?
  The Death and Life of the Great Lakes by Dan Egan
  Nonfiction
  Egan tells the story of the Great Lakes as a series of radical ecological mutations. Ever since the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, and accelerating after the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, the lakes have experienced a parade of ever more villainous invaders, from the vampire-like lamprey to a small bug-eyed fish called the alewife. The attempts to defeat them only led to a series of unintended consequences that made matters worse.
  This is a classic case of human meddling. Lake Erie in particular provides water to 11 million people and experiences more debilitating algal blooms than any of the other Great Lakes. It is suffering because of the presence of life-sucking mussels that have made their way around the lakes on the hulls of speedboats.
  All this means, Egan writes, that we could soon experience ''a natural and public health disaster unlike anything this country has experienced in modern times.''

  I know it's all politics. So who's to blame?
  Losing Earth by Nathaniel Rich
  Nonfiction
  How did we get here, and more importantly, how long have we known it was going to get this bad? Rich's book comes to the shocking conclusion that, as he puts it, ''nearly every conversation we have in 2019 about climate change was being held in 1979.''
  This is a history of what could have been. Rich frames his narrative through a central character, Rafe Pomerance, a Friends of the Earth lobbyist who first came across the issue of global warming in a 1979 E.P.A. report. The problem was met with immediate concern, even by conservatives. But then? The initial clarity and momentum was lost. Rich sees politicians and energy companies as bearing most of the blame.
  The sad fact we're left with is that even though the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established in 1988, a hopeful convergence, more carbon has been emitted into the atmosphere since then than in all the preceding years' of history of civilization.
  Someone must be profiting from climate change. Where's the money?
  Windfall by McKenzie Funk
  Nonfiction 
  In this deeply reported 2014 book, Funk covers the globe to find the stories of those companies and countries that are responding to global warming in the most craven way imaginable. Rather than search for solutions, they are imagining the best means for making money off the changing contours of the planet.
  Shell and Chevron are investing billions in oil fields in the Arctic, where retreating ice has created more exploitable land. China and speculators from Wall Street are setting up huge farms in African countries to take advantage of coming food shortages. Then there is the private security industry, which is gearing up to help prevent the movement of climate refugees with improved walls and surveillance equipment.
  It's a sad tale, which Funk tries to mitigate by also profiling those companies pouring their energies into creative responses to these situations.
  I'd like a novel that taps into my current, IRL dread.
  Weather by Jenny Offill
  Fiction
  Lizzie, the narrator of Offill's latest novel, is a mother who's juggling fears on multiple levels: concern for her brother, a recovering addict; financial worries; and general apprehension about the direction of the world. This taxonomy might feel familiar to many readers: How can you reconcile your personal, daily inconveniences with the fear that the world as we know it is ending?
  Our reviewer pointed out the book's narrative dilemma, asking: ''What happens when the horror of climate change gets lodged so deep under our skin we can't escape it any longer? What happens when an author manages to translate this horror from an abstraction to a gripping tale of immediate particulars?''
  Ultimately, this slim book is an ''attempt to tell a story about climate change that carries the same visceral force as our private emotional dramas -- that is, in fact, inseparable from them.''
  What are some future scenarios?
  The Madaddam Trilogy by Margaret Atwood
  Fiction 
  Atwood's terrifying, though often very funny, series imagines the societal, economic and biological fallout from an ecological disaster right down to glowing rabbits, labs with names like the RejoovenEsense Compound and pseudo-foods called ChickieNobs.
  ''Oryx and Crake,'' the first book, focuses on a character named Snowman, who makes his way as one of the last remaining humans in a post-pandemic world. ''The Year of the Flood,'' the next novel, essentially retells that story from other perspectives, giving Snowman's backstory, set against the backdrop of the arrival of a disaster long feared by a religious cult. And as our reviewer wrote of ''MaddAddam,'' the finale: It ''lights a fire from the fears of our age, then douses it with hope for the planet's survival. But that survival may not include us.''
  I'm a dystopian. Prepare me for the worst.
  The Fifth Season by N.K. Jemisin
  Fiction 
  This fantasy novel, the first in Jemisin's astonishing Broken Earth trilogy, imagines social collapse going hand-in-hand with geologic catastrophe on a planet as violent as the people who inhabit it. With the world's single supercontinent in the process of dividing, and climate change wrought by vast clouds of volcanic ash, the ruling elites work to subjugate a minority population that has some ability to influence planetary events.
  In The Times, the science writer Annalee Newitz praised the book for exploring a science that is ''oddly neglected in science fiction: the geophysics of exoplanets. Though we have plenty of stories about the physics of space travel and the biology of alien life, very few authors tackle the actual rocky, gassy, molten stuff that planets are made of. Jemisin does it brilliantly, crafting a tale that is both intensely moving and scientifically complex.'' The book was the first by an African-American writer to win the Hugo Award for best novel, but not the last: Each of its sequels also won, making Jemisin the first author ever to win the Hugo for every book in a trilogy.
  I need help arguing with my denialist uncle.
  Merchants of Doubt by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway
  Nonfiction 
  Two historians of science, Oreskes and Conway, take a step back to understand the ways that science itself can be co-opted. They begin by looking at how the tobacco industry got scientists to refute studies that linked smoking and lung cancer, and move on to the pernicious role that right-wing think tanks have played in undermining the scientific data about acid rain and the ozone layer.
  The latest and perhaps most dangerous of these campaigns has been waged against climate change. Oreskes and Conway detail how little known but well-funded groups like the Heartland Institute and the Competitive Enterprise Institute have managed to sow doubt on behalf of industries that don't have an interest in confronting global warming.
  The authors also have another warning: In the interest of balance, journalists have sometimes propagated ideas that are false and harmful, inadvertently helping to spread confusion.
  I'm just an old-fashioned tree-hugger.
  The Overstory by Richard Powers
  Fiction
  Trees are the real heroes of this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, a series of interconnected stories that follow characters from 1800s New York to the timber wars of the Pacific Northwest. Whether it's an immigrant family staking its new life on the American chestnut or an 11-year-old coder who has an unfortunate encounter with a Spanish oak, humans' connections to trees make up the emotional core of this book.
  As our our reviewer, Barbara Kingsolver, wrote of Powers: ''Using the tools of story, he pulls readers heart-first into a perspective so much longer-lived and more subtly developed than the human purview that we gain glimpses of a vast, primordial sensibility, while watching our own kind get whittled down to size.''

  What about the animals?
  Flight Behavior by Barbara Kingsolver
  Fiction 
  The sudden, unusual appearance of monarch butterflies rattles a rural Tennessee farm town, and a rift soon opens up in the community: Religious residents see the insect swarms as a sign from God, while others are drawn toward scientific explanations. Dellarobia, a young mother in an unhappy marriage, is one of the latter. When an entomologist comes to town to study the butterflies, he hires Dellarobia to work alongside him, offering her a chance to expand and improve her life.
  Kingsolver, who was a scientist before she began writing novels, seamlessly weaves together the story of a biological aberration and a woman's coming of age.
  I only have time for one canonical read.
  Parable of the Sower by Octavia Butler
  Fiction 
  It's 2024 California and the situation is dire: Water is scarce, communities are walled off and a pill called ''pyro'' gives immense pleasure to people who start fires. As one character puts it: ''People have changed the climate of the world. Now they're waiting for the old days to come back.''
  This 1993 classic is composed of diary entries by an African-American teenager, Lauren, who's determined to make her way in this new world. The daughter of a Baptist minister, she develops her own belief system, Earthseed, and has ''hyperempathy,'' which causes her to experience other people's pain and pleasure as if it were her own. Eventually, she's forced to flee her home and head north, accompanied by a group of survivors who rally behind her vision for a better world.
  What will inspire the climate activist of the future?
  Our House Is on Fire: Greta Thunberg's Call to Save the Planet by Jeanette Winter
  Kids
  With charming artwork and straightforward language, this picture book, aimed at children aged 3 to 8, uses the inspiring life story of the young climate activist Greta Thunberg to help kids understand climate change -- and to give them a sense of what they can do about it.
  By following Thunberg's story -- of a girl who at 15 decided she wasn't going to be complacent about the crises she kept hearing about -- young people can see how powerful an individual can be when they decide to act.
  Though it's aimed at informing and motivating, the book, like Thunberg, is also about urgency. Her dramatic words guide the tone: ''I don't want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic ... I want you to act as if our house is on fire. Because it is.''

  What will our grandchildren think of us?
  The Great Derangement by Amitav Ghosh
  Nonfiction
  Ghosh gets right to the heart of the matter, imagining how our great grandchildren will view us and offering a disturbing vision: We are deranged. Our inability to deal with a catastrophe we can't see but know is coming indicates a failure of imagination.
  The interesting contribution of this book, which comes out of a series of lectures Ghosh delivered at the University of Chicago in 2015, is his indictment of the culture-makers. It has become unfashionable to seem too concerned. To make climate change the theme or setting of a novel, Ghosh writes, is ''to court eviction from the mansion in which serious fiction has long been in residence.''
  His bigger point is that we need a change of narrative. But to do this means that those who make our narratives need to lead the way, to bring their talents of storytelling to bear on what is, he writes, no less than an ''existential danger.''
  What I can do right now?
  The Story of More by Hope Jahren
  Nonfiction
  Jahren, the author of the acclaimed memoir ''Lab Girl,'' turns her attention to climate change and specifically the responsibility we each bear for contributing to the problem. It's not a scolding book -- Jahren approaches the problem from the perspective of her own personal life, her youth in the Midwest and her decision to move to Oslo in 2016 because of the state of scientific research in America.
  She looks at the way our decisions about what we eat affect the planet as a whole. What concerns her is the divide between those who consume and waste more and those who live on much less. By looking at the global disparities, she comes to stark conclusions about who is the cause of the problem and what could be a solution.
  As she puts it, ''What was only a faint drumbeat as I began to research this book now rings in my head like a mantra: Use Less and Share More.''

Scientists say that climate change, which has also contributed to the wildfires on the West Coast, helped intensify a storm that is unleashing a deluge in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi.
BAYOU LA BATRE, Ala. -- Hurricane Sally parked itself over the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, churning slowly and lumbering at a sluggish pace toward land, representing a climate change reality that has made many hurricanes wetter, slower and more dangerous. 
  Sally's outer bands unleashed a relentless rain that began in the morning and continued unabated all day and into the night, threatening to deluge coastal communities in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi. Meteorologists worried -- and almost marveled -- as the storm pushed forward at a speed of just 2 miles per hour, shifting erratically in its path and intensity.
  Scientists saw Sally's stall over the warm waters of the Gulf as yet another effect of climate change in the United States, coming as wildfires along the West Coast have incinerated millions of acres and sent foul air into the atmosphere as far away as Washington, D.C. A scorching summer -- made worse by the burning of fossil fuels, experts say -- led to dry conditions that helped turn this year's wildfires into the worst ever recorded.
  Fires were still burning out of control in Northern California and the Pacific Northwest on Tuesday, and air quality in the region -- some of the worst in the world -- prompted the closure of some schools, parks and beaches.
  With the authorities pleading with residents to stay indoors, the hunt for missing people continued in scorched communities. In New Mexico, scientists were investigating whether the deaths of huge numbers of birds were caused by the smoke plumes altering their migratory routes or poisoning them in the air.
  And all this amid a hurricane season that is among the most active on record. Last month, Hurricane Laura tore across southwest Louisiana, leaving a trail of destruction and cutting electricity that has yet to be restored to many communities.
  Climate change has made hurricanes wetter and slower, scientists have found. Recent research suggests that global warming -- specifically in the Arctic, which is warming much more rapidly than other regions -- is playing a role in weakening atmospheric circulation and thus potentially affecting hurricane speed.
  A 2018 study found that since the middle of the 20th century, translation speeds of all hurricanes and tropical storms had decreased by about 10 percent. Another study that year that focused on Atlantic hurricanes found that the average speed of storms near the North American coast had slowed by more than 15 percent.
  In Bayou La Batre, Ala., where Sally was already turning roads into rivers on Tuesday, Ernest Nelson, a retired commercial fisherman, reached a similar conclusion as he sought refuge under a house raised 10 feet off the ground on concrete pillars.
  Storms were getting bigger and more intense, he said. Mr. Nelson, who had worked the water for decades, gave his basis for that belief: ''No meteorologist. No college degree. Experience.''
  On Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center reported that Sally's translation speed, the rate at which it moves forward, was about 2 miles per hour, and that the storm was not expected to accelerate much as it moved northward in the Gulf of Mexico toward an expected landfall on Wednesday. It was stalling, in effect, as it approached the Mississippi coast.
  But rather than serve as a source of comfort, its languid speed only intensified the unease: Sally, which intensified into a Category 2 storm early Wednesday, is dangerous, meteorologists warned, precisely because it is so slow. Its lingering could translate into major flooding, with more rain than the region typically records over several months.
  Hurricane Paulette, by contrast, was zipping along in the Atlantic on Tuesday with a translation speed of more than 25 m.p.h. after passing Bermuda two days earlier.
  Other recent hurricanes have also stalled. A year ago, Dorian crawled over the Bahamas for a day and a half, causing widespread destruction from wind and storm surge. And Harvey, perhaps the best-known -- and most costly -- example of stalling, was no longer a hurricane by the time it slowed near Houston in August 2017. It had been downgraded to a tropical storm, but still it inundated the city and surrounding communities with four feet or more of rain over several days.
  As Sally churned in the Gulf, the conditions left many living along the coast perplexed and unnerved. No strangers to hurricanes, they weighed the risks of hunkering down against fleeing.
  The confusion came from the storm's apparent fickleness, as the forecast constantly evolved in recent days, with predictions that included reaching west of New Orleans or hitting Biloxi, Miss. On Tuesday evening, the forecast said it was continuing on a path aimed for Mobile Bay, Ala., likely making landfall Wednesday morning.
  Still, officials and meteorologists said there was a measure of certainty in the threat that Sally posed. The rainfall could reach as high as 30 inches in some areas from the Florida panhandle to Mississippi.
  The rainfall would compound a storm surge that could reach as high as four to six feet around Dauphin Island and the Mobile Bay on the Alabama coast, according to the National Hurricane Center. Forecasters from the center also warned of life-threatening flash floods.
  ''I can tell you from many years of experience and many times passed, I've seen streets and neighborhoods quickly fill up with five, six, seven and even more depth of water in a short period of time,'' Sam Cochran, the Mobile County sheriff, said during a briefing on Tuesday.
  And if residents stay behind, he added, it might be ''a couple of days or longer before we can get you out.''
  A hurricane warning remained in effect for an area stretching eastward from Bay St. Louis, Miss., near the Louisiana border, to Navarre, near the tip of the Florida panhandle -- a distance that includes most of Mississippi's and Alabama's coastlines.
  A tropical storm warning covered the area west of the Pearl River to Grand Isle, La. -- including metropolitan New Orleans -- and east of Navarre to Indian Pass, Fla.
  Officials urged people living along the coast and in low-lying areas to clear out, taking advantage of the storm's snail-like pace to avoid being trapped in floodwaters.
  Intense waterfalls of rain began pelting Mobile, an old port city of about 190,000 people, on Tuesday morning. The streets were mostly empty, but many residents had chosen to stay home to ride out a storm that was expected to deposit more than two feet of rain.
  Alonzo Johnson, a high school football coach, was sitting on the front porch of the 80-year-old Craftsman home where he lives with his family south of downtown. There was nothing to do but watch the rain and see how high it would go. Mr. Johnson, 47, said that floodwaters had gone to the bottom of a stop sign across the street in the past. During Katrina, the water had lapped up to the top of his porch, about two feet off the ground.
  ''We're anxious,'' he said. If the water gets high enough, the family would retreat to the back of the house, which is a bit higher. ''We'll find a safe space where we can get to praying.''
  In the oyster and fishing town of Bayou La Batre, how Mr. Nelson found himself under a house, and how the house got built in the first place, was tangled in the long, painful drama of a changing climate that has irrevocably complicated life along the Gulf Coast.
  Mr. Nelson, 66, had been living more than 300 miles west of Bayou La Batre, in the small Louisiana town of Hackberry. But a few weeks ago, Hurricane Laura roared out of the Gulf and devastated Hackberry, including Mr. Nelson's home, a little travel trailer right on the water.
  ''You're looking at the last person to get out of Hackberry,'' said Mr. Nelson, who made his escape just before Laura's landfall, when his sister Stephenie Bosarge, 63, picked him up and brought him to her elevated home just off the water on the Alabama shore.
  A different house had been on the property before Hurricane Katrina blew it away in 2005, along with Ms. Bosarge's wedding bands, family photos and oyster shop. The Volunteers of America came through town and built her this new raised house a few blocks from the water.
  Since Katrina, many houses in Bayou La Batre are now jacked up on stilts, and people have their ways of figuring out what to do with all that space below, parking a truck or boat, stashing junk or storing tools. At her house, Ms. Bosarge installed a tiki bar, some porch swings and a stereo system.
  Soon, they planned on evacuating, riding out the storm with a relative on higher ground in Grand Bay. But for the time being, the siblings sat on their porch swings, watching this new slow-moving disaster unfold around them, wondering how high the water would rise and joking about Mr. Nelson's bad fortune.
  But they were serious about what had happened to their way of life, and the life of so many other Gulf people. ''It is coming to an end,'' Ms. Bosarge said. ''Baby, I knew that years ago.''

Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.
This week, we devoted the Climate Fwd: newsletter to what we eat, and, as climate editor at The New York Times, I’m excited to bring you a special collaboration between The Times’s climate and food teams. 
Every week in this newsletter, we invite you to send us your climate questions, and many of the ones we receive are about food. So, we did something big to answer them: We joined with our colleagues in the food section to bring you information about how to shop, cook and eat in a warming world.
We generally have options about what to eat every day, and those choices have climate consequences. About a quarter of all planet-warming greenhouse gases emitted each year are a result of how we feed the world. Does what you eat have an effect on climate change? The answer is yes, absolutely.
We wanted to give you something comprehensive, something that could help answer the big questions about how what you eat intersects with climate change. Here it is:
Your Questions About Food and Climate Change, Answered
We also wanted to make this personal, because our food choices are incredibly personal. Wondering how the climate effects of your own diet compare with those of other Americans? Nadja Popovich made a quiz for you, to calculate the climate impact of the foods most similar to what you ate for breakfast, lunch and dinner yesterday. (Be honest!)
Quiz: How Does Your Diet Contribute to Climate Change?
And we wanted to offer you the riches of cuisines that are delicious and have smaller carbon footprints than an average American meal. Somini Sengupta shows you five ways to eat sustainably, using examples from traditional cuisines around the world.
We have recipes from the experts at NYT Cooking to help you with            sustainable seafood and            weeknight vegan dinners. We have recipes for all kinds of            bean and lentil dinners and for            delicious grains.

How Does Your Love of Wine Contribute to Climate Change?
Sam Sifton, the food editor at the Times (sign up for his Cooking newsletter here), said, “It was so obvious we needed to do this. The science, after all, is clear. The climate is changing. And a lot of home cooks have been left paralyzed at the stove or in the marketplace as a result, choosing between the farmed salmon and the pasture-raised chicken, the organic tofu, the fair-trade coffee, the heritage carrots. Which is best or safest for the environment? Which hurts it the least? What, in general, are we supposed to buy and cook, if we want to help reduce our carbon footprints, the carbon footprints of our nation, our world?”
We hope you find this special collaboration between climate and food reporters useful, because it’s part of our mission here at The Times to help readers understand the world. Let us know what you think, or if we missed any burning questions, at climateteam@nytimes.com.
Happy reading. We hope you find something inspiring to cook and eat.

Few thought it would arrive so quickly. Now we’re facing consequences once viewed as fringe scenarios.
For decades, most scientists saw climate change as a distant prospect. We now know that thinking was wrong. This summer, for instance, a heat wave in Europe penetrated the Arctic, pushing temperatures into the 80s across much of the Far North and, according to the Belgian climate scientist Xavier Fettweis           , melting some 40 billion tons of Greenland’s ice sheet.
Had a scientist in the early 1990s suggested that within 25 years a single heat wave would measurably raise sea levels, at an estimated two one-hundredths of an inch, bake the Arctic and produce Sahara-like temperatures in Paris and Berlin, the prediction would have been dismissed as alarmist. But many worst-case scenarios from that time are now realities. 
Science is a process of discovery. It can move slowly as the pieces of a puzzle fall together and scientists refine their investigative tools. But in the case of climate, this deliberation has been accompanied by inertia born of bureaucratic caution and politics. A recent essay in Scientific American argued that scientists “tend to underestimate the severity of threats and the rapidity with which they might unfold” and said one of the reasons was “the perceived need for consensus.” This has had severe consequences, diluting what should have been a sense of urgency and vastly understating the looming costs of adaptation and dislocation as the planet continues to warm. 
In 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations group of thousands of scientists representing 195 countries, said in its first report that climate change would arrive at a stately pace, that the methane-laden Arctic permafrost was not in danger of thawing, and that the Antarctic ice sheets were stable.
Relying on the climate change panel’s assessment, economists estimated that the economic hit would be small, providing further ammunition against an aggressive approach to reducing emissions and to building resilience to climate change.
As we now know, all of those predictions turned out to be completely wrong. Which makes you wonder whether the projected risks of further warming, dire as they are, might still be understated. How bad will things get?
So far, the costs of underestimation have been enormous. New York City’s subway system did not flood in its first 108 years, but Hurricane Sandy’s 2012 storm surge caused nearly $5 billion in water damage, much of which is still not repaired. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey gave Houston and the surrounding region a $125 billion lesson about the costs of misjudging the potential for floods.
The climate change panel seems finally to have caught up with the gravity of the climate crisis. Last year, the organization detailed the extraordinary difficulty of limiting warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius), over the next 80 years, and the grim consequences that will result even if that goal is met.
More likely, a separate United Nations report concluded, we are headed for warming of at least 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit. That will come with almost unimaginable            damage to economies and ecosystems. Unfortunately, this dose of reality arrives more than 30 years after human-caused climate change became a mainstream issue. 
 The word “upended” does not do justice to the revolution in climate science wrought by the discovery of sudden climate change. The realization that the global climate can swing between warm and cold periods in a matter of decades or even less came as a profound shock to scientists who thought those shifts took hundreds if not thousands of years.
Scientists knew major volcanic eruptions or asteroid strikes could affect climate rapidly, but such occurrences were uncommon and unpredictable. Absent such rare events, changes in climate looked steady and smooth, a consequence of slow-moving geophysical factors like the earth’s orbital cycle in combination with the tilt of the planet’s axis, or shifts in the continental plates.
Then, in the 1960s, a few scientists began to focus on an unusual event that took place after the last ice age. Scattered evidence suggested that the post-ice age warming was interrupted by a sudden cooling that began around 12,000 years ago and ended abruptly 1,300 years later. The era was named the Younger Dryas for a plant that proliferated during that cold period.
At first, some scientists questioned the rapidity and global reach of the cooling. A report           from the National Academies of Science in 1975 acknowledged the Younger Dryas but concluded that it would take centuries for the climate to change in a meaningful way. But not everyone agreed. The climate scientist            Wallace Broecker at Columbia had offered a theory that changes in ocean circulation could bring about sudden climate shifts like the Younger Dryas. 
And it was Dr. Broecker who, in 1975, the same year as that National Academies report playing down the Younger Dryas, published a paper, titled “Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?” in which he predicted that emissions of carbon dioxide would raise global temperatures significantly in the 21st century. This is now seen as prophetic, but at the time, Dr. Broecker was an outlier. 
Then, in the early 1990s, scientists completed more precise studies of ice cores extracted from the Greenland ice sheet. Dust and oxygen isotopes encased in the cores provided a detailed climate record going back eons. It revealed that there had been 25 rapid climate change events like the Younger Dryas in the last glacial period.
The evidence in those ice cores would prove pivotal in turning the conventional wisdom. As the science historian Spencer Weart put it: “How abrupt was the discovery of abrupt climate change? Many climate experts would put their finger on one moment: the day they read the 1993 report of the analysis of Greenland ice cores. Before that, almost nobody confidently believed that the climate could change massively within a decade or two; after the report, almost nobody felt sure that it could not.”
In 2002, the National Academies acknowledged the reality of rapid climate change in a report, “Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises,” which described the new consensus as a “paradigm shift.” This was a reversal of its 1975 report.
 “Large, abrupt climate changes have affected hemispheric to global regions repeatedly, as shown by numerous paleoclimate records,” the report said, and added that “changes of up to 16 degrees Celsius and a factor of 2 in precipitation have occurred in some places in periods as short as decades to years.”
The National Academies report added that the implications of such potential rapid changes had not yet been considered by policymakers and economists. And even today, 17 years later, a substantial portion of the American public remains unaware or unconvinced it is happening. 
Were the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica to melt, sea levels would rise by an estimated 225 feet worldwide. Few expect that to happen anytime soon. But those ice sheets now look a lot more fragile than they did to the climate change panel in 1995, when it            said that little change was expected over the next hundred years. 
In the years since, data has shown that both Greenland and Antarctica have been shedding ice far more rapidly than anticipated. Ice shelves, which are floating extensions of land ice, hold back glaciers from sliding into the sea and eventually melting. In the early 2000s,            ice shelves began disintegrating in several parts of Antarctica, and scientists realized that process could greatly            accelerate the demise of the vastly larger ice sheets themselves. And some            major glaciers are dumping ice directly into the ocean.
By 2014, a number of scientists had concluded that an irreversible collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet had already begun, and computer modeling in 2016 indicated that its disintegration in concert with other melting            could raise sea levels up to six feet by 2100, about twice the increase described as a possible worst-case scenario just three years earlier. At that pace, some of the world’s great coastal cities, including New York, London and Hong Kong, would become inundated. 
Then this year, a review of 40 years of satellite images suggested that the East Antarctic ice sheet, which was thought to be relatively stable, may also be shedding vast amounts of ice.
As the seas rise, they are also warming at a pace unanticipated as recently as five years ago. This is very bad news. For one thing, a warmer ocean means more powerful storms, and die-offs of marine life, but it also suggests that            the planet is more sensitiveto increased carbon dioxide emissions than previously thought.
The melting of permafrost has also defied expectations. This is ground that has remained frozen for at least two consecutive years and covers around a quarter of the exposed land mass of the Northern Hemisphere. As recently as 1995, it was thought to be stable. But by 2005,            the National Center for Atmospheric Research estimated that up to 90 percent of the Northern Hemisphere’s topmost layer of permafrost could thaw by 2100, releasing vast amounts of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere.
For all of the missed predictions, changes in the weather are confirming earlier expectations that a warming globe would be accompanied by an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather. And there are new findings unforeseen by early studies, such as the extremely rapid intensification of storms, as on Sept. 1, when Hurricane Dorian’s sustained winds intensified from 150 to 185 miles per hour in just nine hours, and last year when Hurricane Michael grew from tropical depression to major hurricane in just two days.
If the Trump administration has its way, even the revised worst-case scenarios may turn out to be too rosy. In late August, the administration announced a plan to roll back regulations intended to limit methane emissions resulting from oil and gas exploration, despite opposition from some of the largest companies subject to those regulations.   More recently, its actions approached the surreal as the            Justice Department opened an antitrust investigation into those auto companies that have agreed in principle to abide by higher gas mileage standards required by California. The administration also formally revoked a waiver allowing California to set stricter limits on tailpipe emissions than the federal government.
Even if scientists end up having lowballed their latest assessments of the consequences of the greenhouse gases we continue to emit into the atmosphere, their predictions are dire enough. But the Trump administration has made its posture toward climate change abundantly clear: Bring it on!
 It’s already here. And it is going to get worse. A lot worse.

Idaho Stripped Climate Change From School Guidelines. Now, It’s a Battle.

The political fight over global warming has extended to science education in recent years as several states have attempted to weaken or block new teaching standards that included information about climate science. But only in Idaho has the state legislature stripped all mentions of human-caused climate change from statewide science guidelines while leaving the rest of the standards intact.
Now teachers, parents and students are pushing back, hoping to convince the Republican-controlled Idaho Legislature to approve revised standards, which science proponents say are watered down but would still represent a victory for climate-change education in the state. The Idaho House education committee could vote as soon as Wednesday on whether to allow the revised language into the state’s curriculum.
[Update: The committee voted to approve the revised standards but removed supporting content that contained multiple references to human-driven warming.]
“We’re hopeful that we can put a final bow on this,” said Scott Cook, the director of academics at the Idaho State Department of Education, who helps lead a committee of teachers, parents and scientists urging that climate change be included in the standards.
The battle started in early 2016, when Idaho was working to update its decade-old science standards for kindergarten through 12th grade, which outside education groups said were out of date. Lawmakers rejected a new set of standards, which were closely modeled after national guidelines developed by a consortium of states and science organizations and included information on climate change, saying more input from the public was needed.
Last year, the House education committee accepted the new standards, but only after scrubbing five sections related to climate change. The passages about climate change were “surgically removed,” said Glenn Branch, deputy director of the National Center for Science Education, which monitors anti-science legislation.
Now, Mr. Cook’s committee has reworked those passages in an effort to win approval from lawmakers. The revised standards include natural causes of climate change alongside those driven by humans, and, in response to lawmakers’ requests, they emphasize potential solutions to climate change.
“The committee took a true course between the rocks on one side and the whirlpool on the other,” Mr. Cook said, describing how it had been difficult to strike a balance between language that was scientifically accurate but was satisfying to lawmakers. Where the original standards placed a stronger emphasis on human activity as the primary cause of climate change, the revised standards note that both “human activities” and “natural processes” can affect the Earth’s temperature.
“Although this is not exactly untrue, to say this in the context of a discussion of ‘current changes in climate’ is to suggest a significant role of natural activities in current climate change, which is misleading,” Mr. Branch said in an email. Still, he said he hoped the revised standards would be approved.
While Idaho teachers can still choose to include climate change in their lesson plans — and many do in places like Boise, the state’s capital and biggest city — science educators said they were concerned for teachers in districts where climate change was considered more controversial. Without state standards, those teachers might choose not to teach climate change at all, said Christopher Taylor, the science supervisor for the Boise School District.
Mr. Taylor said he was not worried about his own district. “It’s these small rural districts,” he said. “They will do what the state says.”
Even in Boise, “When you teach environmental science, you’re constantly being discredited,” said Erin Stutzman, a science teacher at Timberline High School in the capital, which, along with other schools nationally, has been mailed anti-science materials from the Heartland Institute, a group that denies the reality of human-induced climate change.
“If the community opposes it or thinks it’s some kind of propaganda, it puts those children coming out of those districts at a major disadvantage,” Ms. Stutzman said. “It’s an equity issue.”
Only 24 percent of Republicans in solid-red Idaho agree with the scientific consensus that climate change is caused mostly by human activities, according to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, the lowest percentage of any state. 
“It’s a political issue, and it shouldn’t be a political issue,” Mr. Taylor said.
The public response to the new proposal appears to be largely positive. House lawmakers heard testimony last week from 28 people, all of whom spoke in favor of the revised standards. And roughly 1,000 comments were received during the public comment period, only five of which were negative, Mr. Cook said.
Emily Her, 17, a student of Ms. Stutzman’s, testified at the hearing and is leading a petition that supports the teaching of climate change in Idaho. She said she was not afraid to speak up about the standards in Boise, but worried about people her age in districts where climate change may not be part of the curriculum. “It really puts the students at a disadvantage when the teachers have fear,” she said.
After mentioning climate change in her testimony, Ms. Her was cut off by the chairwoman of the education committee, Julie VanOrden, who asked Ms. Her to stick to talking about the standards.
“This is not a hearing on whether we have climate change, or we don’t have climate change,” Ms. VanOrden said later in the hearing.
“When the chair said that, I felt sick,” Ms. Her wrote in an email. “The lack of these science standards is really just the deliberate censorship of facts,” she added in an interview. “This is our future, and it’s in their hands.”
Ms. VanOrden initially agreed to an interview but did not immediately respond to attempts to schedule one. 
In some states, state departments of education and local boards of education have the authorityto approve educational standards without the legislature weighing in. 
Gov. C. L. Otter, a Republican, said in a statement that he supported efforts to implement the revised standards.
Mr. Cook said the Education Department would not allow lawmakers to change the science of climate change. “If they come back and say, we’re going to pull this out and say backyard barbecuing or volcanic activity is the cause, that would be a bridge too far,” he said.

GLEN ELDER, Kan. — Doug Palen, a fourth-generation grain farmer on Kansas’ wind-swept plains, is in the business of understanding the climate. Since 2012, he has choked through the harshest drought to hit the Great Plains in a century, punctuated by freakish snowstorms and suffocating gales of dust. His planting season starts earlier in the spring and pushes deeper into winter.
To adapt, he has embraced an environmentally conscious way of farming that guards against soil erosion and conserves precious water. He can talk for hours about carbon sequestration — the trapping of global-warming-causing gases in plant life and in the soil — or the science of the beneficial microbes that enrich his land.
In short, he is a climate change realist. Just don’t expect him to utter the words “climate change.”
“If politicians want to exhaust themselves debating the climate, that’s their choice,” Mr. Palen said, walking through fields of freshly planted winter wheat. “I have a farm to run.”
Here in north-central Kansas, America’s breadbasket and conservative heartland, the economic realities of agriculture make climate change a critical business issue. At the same time, politics and social pressure make frank discussion complicated. This is wheat country, and Donald J. Trump country, and though the weather is acting up, the conservative orthodoxy maintains that the science isn’t settled.
So while climate change is part of daily conversation, it gets disguised as something else.
“People are all talking about it, without talking about it,” said Miriam Horn, the author of a recent book on conservative Americans and the environment, “Rancher, Farmer, Fisherman.” “It’s become such a charged topic that there’s a navigation people do.”
Mr. Palen — he plays his politics close to his vest but allows that he didn’t vote for Hillary Clinton — and others here in Glen Elder and across the state illustrate the delicate dance.
Farmers like him focus on practical issues like erosion or dwindling aquifers. “When you don’t get the rainfall, it’s tough times,” he said.
Regional politicians and business leaders speak of pursuing jobs that clean energy may create, rather than pressing the need to rein in carbon emissions. A science teacher at a community college — whose deeply religious students sometimes express doubts about the trustworthiness of science that contradicts biblical teachings — speaks to his class about the positives of scientific discovery (electricity) in order to ease into more contentious subjects (global warming).
And an editor for a closely followed agriculture magazine, Successful Farming, recently made a controversial move, drawing a flurry of angry letters: He broke with longstanding policy to address climate change head-on.
“Some readers thanked us,” the editor Gil Gullickson said. “But some wondered whether we’d been hijacked by avid environmentalists.”
The climate has not always been such a partisan issue. Richard Nixon, a Republican president, set up the Environmental Protection Agency and signed the Clean Air Act. Ronald Reagan ushered in the Montreal Protocol, the first global treaty to protect the global atmosphere.
Much of that consensus has broken down, in no small part because of a well-financed push by fossil-fuel interests, together with influential Republican allies, to attack well-established research on topics like global warming and push back on environmental regulation. That push began in earnest during the George W. Bush administration as attempts to undercut the Clean Air Act, and since then, the divide has widened.
President Trump has famously said he believes that climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese, and his administration has purged nearly all mention of climate-change programs from the White House and State Department websites. It has also ordered a freeze on federal grant spending at the E.P.A. and other government agencies.
The fact that the climate-change discourse has also become dominated by liberals has alienated some conservatives, including Mr. Palen. Many people here in particular resent how, in the polarized political landscape of recent years, conservative Americans have been painted as hostile to the environment.
The Trump campaign successfully seized on that schism, painting Democrats as overzealous environmentalists with little sympathy for the economic realities or social mores of rural America. “Many of our federal environmental laws are being used to oppress farmers instead of actually helping the environment,” Mr. Trump quipped in a widely circulated Q. and A. on            FarmFutures.com. “Farmers care more for the environment than the radical environmentalists.”
Still, “it would be a huge mistake to think people voting for Trump were voting against the environment,” Ms. Horn said. If Trump follows an aggressive anti-environment agenda, she said, “there will be a big backlash in the heartland.”
Defender of the Soil
In many ways, Mr. Palen sees himself as the ultimate conservationist. His great-grandfather, the son of an immigrant from Luxembourg, was the first to farm in this stretch of north-central Kansas.
Mr. Palen grew up on the farm, took it over in his 20s, and looked to make his mark. In college, he learned of a farming technique called “no till,” which is intended to more closely mimic the natural prairie ecosystem, and was intrigued by its promise to protect his family fields from Kansas’ relentless winds and sudden downpours. The idea behind no-till farming, he now explains to anyone who will listen, is that plowing the soil destroys its natural structure, causing it to lose its precious moisture and nutrients. That makes it vulnerable to erosion.
Mr. Palen’s fields aren’t tilled. There are no neat furrows. The residue of plants from previous plantings still carpets the earth, offering a layer of protection, and his fields are never bare even after harvest. He alternates wheat and other crops with what he describes as a cocktail of grasses and leafy plants, like grain sorghum, sunflowers and alfalfa, a gesture toward the diversity of the wild prairie. “They say there’s more organisms in a handful of soil than people on the planet,” Mr. Palen said, making his way through a field between plantings. He stooped his tall frame down, dug up a clump of earth, and rolled it between his fingers. He is soft-spoken, yet when he talks of the earth, his excitement is obvious.
“See how it’s firm and holds together?” he said. “See how it doesn’t break down into goo?”
No-till farming addresses a dire problem facing American farmers: Almost 1.7 billion tons of topsoil are blown or washed off croplands a year, according to the Department of Agriculture, resulting in billions of dollars in losses for farmers. Keeping the soil healthy and covered also reduces evaporation by 80 percent, helping farmers conserve water, the department estimates.
Farmers like Mr. Palen also happen to be protecting a vast and valuable carbon sink, making him an ally to climate-change campaigners. The soil traps far more carbon in its depths than all plant and animal life on the earth’s surface, scientists estimate. A 2013 study estimated that no-till and other restorative farming methods could achieve up to 15 percent of the total carbon reduction needed to stabilize the climate.
Despite his conservationist streak, Mr. Palen has no affinity for environmentalists. He feels vilified, he says, for his continued use of chemical herbicides and pesticides. (Some organic farmers control weeds by tilling the soil, which Mr. Palen argues causes more ecological harm.) And he remains suspicious of any expansion of government regulations that ignore realities of rural America.
“We want to be left alone,” Mr. Palen said. He singled out the Clean Water Rule, an E.P.A. regulation designed to protect streams and other waterways, as regulatory overreach. Washington types wanted to dictate what he could do with every creek, every puddle, on his farm, he said, putting impossible burdens on farmers.
And most of them had probably never spent any time on a farm, he said. “We’re the ones working to protect the environment. We’re the ones whose lives are tied to the earth.”
Honing Scientific Strategy
Carl Priesendorf, a science teacher at Metropolitan Community College in Kansas City, Mo., has learned strategies to talk about climate change without completely alienating climate skeptics. He teaches geology and meteorology. Those subjects would usually be innocuous, but not here.
“I’d show the CO2 data — how we’d had the hottest year on record,” Mr. Priesendorf said. “But I get students who basically say what I’m teaching is nonsense. My car’s been keyed. I get notes from students saying they’re praying for my soul.” One such note that he shared reads, “Know that God’s love surpasses knowledge.”
Since a particularly contentious debate in class — a student threw a book bag at him, he said — Mr. Priesendorf has taken a step back to focus on the everyday positives of science. “I ask: ‘Do you like the light bulb? Do you like electricity?’ That’s science,” he said. “Then I ease into more contentious topics, like climate change.”
That is an uphill battle. A 2013 survey found that just 8 percent of farmers in the Midwest believed that “climate change is occurring, and it is caused mostly by human activities.” An earlier            Pew Research Center poll found that only 48 percent of people in the Midwest agree with the statement that there is “solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer,” a number below other regions in the country.
And conservatives have been pushing back against classroom standards adopted by the state of Kansas that treat evolution and climate change as scientific concepts. Last year, the United States Supreme Court declined to review a nonprofit group’s lawsuit that claimed that those standards promote atheism.
But now, under a Trump administration, Mr. Priesendorf felt science itself was under fire. “If even your government starts telling your country that scientists are lying to you, it’ll be even tougher for science teachers,” he said. “I’m going to focus on keeping my students’ minds open to the possibility that the science is correct.”
Lawmaker Forges Alliances
Annie Kuether, a Democrat and clean-energy advocate in the Republican-controlled Statehouse and a member of the State Utilities Committee, has for years pushed for more renewable energy. One obstacle, though, is that the committee’s chairman does not believe in climate change.
A St. Louis native who landed in Topeka as a young bride four decades ago, Ms. Kuether is used to working alongside adversaries. Her county voted for Mr. Trump, along with all but two counties in the state.
She has sat through committee meetings where climate skeptics, including the discredited scientist Wei-Hock Soon, blasted the science behind global warming. “Carbon Dioxide, CO2, is merely a bit player in climate change,” reads one slide Mr. Soon presented in 2013. “Rising CO2 is largely beneficial to plant and human life.”
“I remember being horrified,” Ms. Kuether said.
Still, over the years, she has forged powerful business alliances by focusing, in her arguments, on jobs and the economy. She has also found increasing support from farmers and landowners who count on wind turbines and solar panels they host on their property for income.
“Gradually, from a political standpoint, you can build a constituency that benefits from this industry,” said Mark Lawlor, one ally and an executive at Clean Line Energy Partners, which is building a 780-mile transmission line to deliver 4,000 megawatts of wind power from western Kansas to Missouri, Illinois and other neighboring states.
“Just like grain, cattle, airplanes, wind’s another valuable resource Kansas can export,” he said, referring to Kansas’ sizable agricultural industry, as well as the Cessna Aircraft Company, which is based in Wichita, Kan. “Kansas has a lot of pragmatic folks here, and we recognize benefits.”
Kansas’ dwindling water sources have been another issue that Ms. Kuether has found strikes a nerve among voters here, whatever their beliefs on climate change. That has helped to build some support for measures to save the state’s shrinking aquifers, a lifeline for communities in western Kansas, though not yet any decisive action.
In fact, her focus on the practical is a big part of what has kept getting her elected, she said, in a State Legislature where she is outnumbered by Republican lawmakers, two to one. “I’ve always felt that families have always been concerned about water — whether they’re Democratic, Republican or independent,” she said.
Publication Takes a Stand
Mr. Gullickson of Successful Farming, who usually writes about topics like pigweed, gypsum and runoff, has started to push the envelope on debates over climate change. An 11-year veteran of the magazine, where he is the crops technology editor, Mr. Gullickson said he had long been on the fence about climate change. But that began changing five years ago, when he attended a workshop where a University of Kentucky professor gave a convincing argument, backed by data.
“I started looking at the evidence, at the data and what farmers were doing,” he said. “And it’s clear: The weather has become more extreme these days. And I thought, ‘I’ve never heard of any successful business publication that stayed in business by withholding information.’”
So for the first time in the storied magazine’s 115-year-old history, a cover story squarely addressed the science of climate change. The October 2014 piece was published under the headline, “@#$*% Weather!”
“I know what you’re thinking: Climate change is just some figment of Al Gore’s imagination adopted by liberal tree-huggers who want to tank the U.S. economy,” Mr. Gullickson wrote.
“Still, think back over some rough weather you’ve endured in recent years and ask yourself these questions,” he continued. “Are springs getting wetter? Are droughts increasing in severity? Are rainstorms increasing in intensity?” The clear answer, he said: “Yes.”
Mr. Gullickson said that he and his editor had held lengthy discussions leading up to the article’s publication. His editor in chief, Dave Kurns, was supportive, he said, but also warned that the piece could generate backlash.
Mr. Kurns spoke candidly over concerns of a backlash in an editor’s note that led the issue. When he became the magazine’s editor two years earlier, he said, he had been warned, “Never use the words ‘climate change.’”
“I was told: ‘Readers hate that phrase. Just talk about the weather,’” he wrote.
The industry publication, which has a circulation of 390,000, was influenced by some of the biggest names in agriculture taking a stand on the issue, Mr. Gullickson said. The agricultural giant Cargill has started to lobby members of Congress and urged farmers to take climate change seriously, saying inaction would be detrimental to the United States economy.
The response to the magazine’s take on the issues has been split.
“When you start quoting ‘climate scientists’ and the United Nations,” wrote in one reader, Bill Clinger, a farmer based in Harpster, Ohio, “you are as nutty as Al Gore.” Measures to control emissions, he said, “are just seductive names for socialist programs intended to micromanage people and businesses.”
Mr. Gullickson said some readers thanked him. “Finally, a farming magazine comes to terms with what is going on with the weather,” wrote Paul Jereczek of Dodge, Wis.
Reached by phone, Mr. Jereczek, who runs a dairy farm, expressed exasperation at people’s inability to speak openly. “The phrase has become so politicized, it’s just hard to talk about,” he said. “But we talk about everything else. Even round here, protecting soil is such a hot topic right now. But we talk about the soil, saving fertilizer, that sort of thing.”
Grouse to the Rescue
Mark Salvo, vice president at the wildlife conservation group Defenders of Wildlife, might be a walking, talking stereotype of the kind of environmentalist who so frustrates Mr. Palen. An Oregonian now based in Washington, he spent 15 years in the American West fighting to conserve fish and wildlife on public lands.
But Mr. Salvo thinks he knows an unlikely — and highly sympathetic — character to bring Kansans and others together around climate change: the lesser prairie-chicken.
Known for its shock of yellow hair and bright orange cheeks, the lesser prairie-chicken once roamed the Great Plains. Today, though, the grouse is under threat — its populations reduced to isolated pockets in western Kansas, Colorado and the Texas-New Mexico border as its habitat succumbs to climate-induced drought, farming, drilling and other human activity.
The group has been petitioning the Fish and Wildlife Service to relist the lesser prairie-chicken as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The bird found itself taken off the list after a lawsuit in 2014 backed by the oil and gas industry, which argues that any protective measures would mean added costs for energy developers.
Mr. Salvo has found that to gain allies it doesn’t always help to start with the role climate change plays in harming the bird’s habitat. Instead, his movement has tried to find common ground, highlighting the historical heritage of the lesser prairie-chicken. In the “Little House on the Prairie” novels, Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote about eating prairie-chicken mush.
Mr. Salvo also stresses how grouse-friendly practices can be good for farming, too, backing a federal program that provides financial aid to private landowners who adopt those practices. Leaving corn stubble standing after harvest gives the birds food and places to hide, for example, while also helping farmers protect the soil.
“Sometimes, to gain allies, it helps to focus on issues of common concern, to support local economic development as well as species conservation,” he said. “It helps everybody come to the table.”
Last week, Mr. Palen, the farmer, was again talking weather — if not climate change — at a conference of no-till farmers in Salina, Kan. Sessions included “Using Your Water Efficiently,” “Making Weather Work for You in 2017” and “Building Healthy Soil With Mob Grazing,” a practice that helps to fertilize the land.
And yes, Mr. Palen says, he is on board with saving the lesser prairie-chicken. “I often think of ways I can protect their habitat,” he said. “I enjoy wildlife.”

The country debates women's honor inexhaustibly but pays little attention to the ferocious and imminent dangers of climate disasters.
Karachi is home. My bustling, chaotic city of about 20 million people on the Arabian Sea is an ethnically and religiously diverse metropolis and the commercial capital of Pakistan, generating more than half of the country's revenue. 
  Over the decades, Karachi has survived violent sectarian strife, political violence between warring groups claiming the city and terrorism. Karachi has survived its gangsters sparring with rocket launchers; its police force, more feared than common criminals; its rulers and bureaucrats committed to rapacious, bottomless corruption. Now Karachi faces its most terrifying adversary: climate change.
  In August, Karachi's stifling summer heat was heavy and pregnant. The sapodilla trees and frangipani leaves were lush and green; the Arabian Sea, quiet and distant, had grown muddy. When the palm fronds started to sway, slowly, the city knew the winds had picked up and rain would follow. Every year the monsoons come -- angrier and wilder -- lashing the unprepared city. Studies show that climate change is causing monsoons to be more intense and less predictable, and cover larger areas of land for longer periods of time.
  On Aug. 27, Karachi received nearly nine inches of monsoon rain, the highest amount of rainfall ever in a single day. Nineteen inches of rain fell in August, according to the meteorological officials. It is enough to drown a city that has no functioning drainage, no emergency systems and no reliable health care (except for those who can pay). Thousands of homes and settlements of the poor were subsumed and destroyed, and more than 100 people were killed.
  A traders association estimated that the submerging of markets and warehouses damaged goods worth 25 billion Pakistani rupees, or about $150 million. Local papers estimated that with Karachi at a standstill for a week, in some congested areas for longer, Pakistan's gross domestic product suffered daily losses of $449 million -- a number that didn't include the enormous informal economy. The World Bank estimates that 15 percent of gross domestic product of the Sindh province (Karachi is its capital) is lost every year to environmental damage and climate change.
  Pakistan is the fifth most climate vulnerable nation in the world. Between 1998 and 2018, according to the Global Climate Risk Index, the country is estimated to have lost nearly 10,000 lives to climate-related disasters and suffered losses amounting to about $4 billion from 152 extreme weather events in that period. Analysts have estimated Pakistan's climate migrants over the past decade at around 30 million people.
  There is no end to the catalog of climate disasters affecting my country. The glaciers in the Hindu Kush, the Himalayas and the Karakoram in northern Pakistan are melting at an accelerated pace. If the emission trends and temperature rises continue unabated, these mountains could lose between a third to two-thirds of their ice fields by 2100. The result will be catastrophic: By 2050, the increased melting will result in landslides, heavy flooding, dam bursts and soil erosion. After the glaciers have melted away, drought and famine will follow.
  The terror of our coming era will be born of heat and fire and ice. Some years ago, I was in a village in Sindh after a massive flood had devastated it. Thousands were displaced overnight. The blistering heat soaked the faces of displaced young women in sweat thick like glycerin. I was unsure what would be more lethal -- the drowning or the heat.
  Not far from that drowned village in Sindh is the city of Jacobabad, where temperatures in the summer run as high as 124 degrees Fahrenheit. It is the hottest city in Asia, if not the world. Jacobabad has long electricity blackouts. Its poor die as they toil in the fields.
  Temperature increases have brought plague after plague in rural areas. This year has brought Pakistan the most devastating locust infestations in nearly 30 years. The insects destroyed entire harvests, causing the government to call a national emergency as winter crops were decimated, resulting in losses of $2.5 billion. The locusts descend like a haze, so thick that from a distance it looked like a soft pink fog. Because of heavy rains and cyclones, there has been unprecedented breeding of locusts in the United Arab Emirates. They traveled to us from the Arabian Peninsula.
  This is a climate war between the large industrial superpowers, financial predators that have polluted and poisoned our planet for profit, and the poor, who have done the least damage but will pay all of the consequences. Pakistan is responsible for less than 1 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but its people will bear the burden of the world's deadliest polluters. If nothing is done to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the World Bank, 800 million people in South Asia will be at risk of amplified poverty, homelessness and hunger.
  The World Bank has identified Karachi as one the planet's climate hot spots. Temperatures across South Asia are estimated to rise by 3.9 degrees Fahrenheit in the next 30 years. Karachi is already struggling with poor road connectivity, dire educational facilities and limited market access. Its already pathetic public health system will plummet. The rich might buy generators for electricity, pay for water tanks and rely on expensive hospitals, but the poor will continue to be devastated.
  Pakistan's current government is speaking about climate change, but it is a conversation that has come too late, unaccompanied by serious action. In 1947, Pakistan was 33 percent forest. Today, we have tree cover of just about 4 percent, all because of deforestation. This destruction, largely caused by the illegal logging by timber mafias, has silted up our waterways and left us undefended against floods and storms.
  The country can easily be whipped into hysteria over supposed religious infractions committed by minorities and can debate women's modesty and honor inexhaustibly, but it has little attention for the ferocious and imminent dangers of climate change.
  Karachi's rainfall, like the rising temperatures, is a consequence of the raging climate war. We have sat by and watched how cities die: slowly. We didn't watch closely enough when the villages sank and struggled. But it is clear now that this is how a planet burns, one fire at a time, one degree hotter until eventually all that remains will be the chalky bones of Karachi's ancient saints, buried on disappeared cliffs.

LUBBOCK, Tex. -- A member of Katharine Hayhoe's church asked her a question after services a couple of weeks ago: ''Do you feel our weather is getting more extreme?''
Time was, the question might have been the start of an argument with Dr. Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University here. Instead, it led to a friendly discussion of the kinds of things they had both seen: Because of climate change, the always shifting weather in West Texas was showing greater extremes, including more severe drought and fiercer inundations when storms came. 
  When she started her work spreading the word about climate change in Texas, very few people in the Lone Star State believed it was happening, and even fewer believed that people were causing it. Since then, acceptance has grown: A 2013 poll by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found that seven in 10 Texans agree that climate change is real, though fewer than half said humans were the major cause.
  The evidence of changing weather patterns is not just in the news, but all around them: More than half of those in the Texas survey said they had personally experienced the effects of global warming.
  Dr. Hayhoe is not a climate pioneer like Al Gore or a street-marching activist like Bill McKibben or a geek icon like Bill Nye. But she has emerged as one of the nation's most effective communicators on the threat of climate change and the need for action.
  She lives and works out here in West Texas, but lately seems to be everywhere, kicking off a series of ''Global Weirding'' videos, posting on Twitter and Facebook, and speaking anywhere from local churches to international conferences. Last week, she appeared at the White House to discuss climate change with President Obama  and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio at the first South by South Lawn ideas festival.
  Dr. Hayhoe has come to prominence in part because she is just so darned nice. It would be too easy to chalk that up to her Canadian background -- she says it does help explain her commitment to finding consensus -- and she has found that she gets her science across more effectively if she can connect with people personally. In a nation seemingly addicted to argument as a blood sport, she conciliates. On a topic so contentious that most participants snarl, she smiles. She is an evangelical Christian, and she does not flinch from using the language of faith and stewardship to discuss the fate of the planet.
  ''Katharine Hayhoe is a national treasure,'' said Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. He said that she combined powerful communications skills, world-class scientific credentials and an ability to relate to conservative religious communities that can be skeptical about the risks of a changing climate.
  Gavin Schmidt, a NASA climate scientist, said in an email that Dr. Hayhoe's faith is an important factor, because ''people can accept unwelcome truths much more readily if they come from within, rather than from outside, their community/family/group.''
  While some climate warriors treat those who are not inclined to believe them as dupes or fools, she wants to talk. ''If you begin a conversation with, 'You're an idiot,' that's the end of the conversation, too,'' she said over tacos at a Tex-Mex restaurant, having ordered in the fluent Spanish she picked up during her parents' missionary service in Colombia. She is 44, but seems younger -- someone who speaks with authority but can punctuate a statement about a surprising scientific fact with a wondering, almost giggly, ''Isn't that crazy?''
  Now, in a presidential election race with high stakes for responding to climate change -- Donald J. Trump has called global warming a hoax and would reverse deals that President Obama has spearheaded to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while Hillary Clinton has called for continuing along Mr. Obama's path -- there is room for many approaches. Some will rally the troops; she will reach out to the quiet people in the middle, the undecided, who might listen.
  She gets her share of abuse; you really don't want to read the emails she gets, and she spends a fair amount of her time on Twitter blocking people who try to bait her with abusive language. But she still tries to present herself and the science without tumult, and with a measure of optimism.
  Dr. Hayhoe did not set out to be a smiling climate crusader. In the scientific circles of her training, she encountered no one who needed to be convinced that what she was studying was valid, any more than a professor of literature would have to argue in favor of the existence of books.
  But then she started to realize that many people didn't agree. She discovered to her shock six months after her marriage to Andrew Farley, a linguistics scholar, that he was among the dubious.
  She discussed that moment of realization with her students in class last month. Her husband had only understood her dissertation work to be some arcane combination of chemistry and computation; he did not believe climate change was real.
  ''And I think, 'Whoa!''' she said.
  Her husband, from Virginia, was raised by staunch Republicans and had taken their point of view without exploring it deeply. The young couple talked out the issues in painstaking detail over the next year and a half, he bringing up questions from his own reading by denialists, and Dr. Hayhoe researching and answering.
  Ultimately, she convinced him, with the help of a NASA website on climate change that shows  rising global temperatures over time. He had to ask himself, ''Is NASA, who put men on the moon, involved in a global, worldwide, multidecade hoax, or is it really real?'' she said.
  When they were done, they wrote a book together, ''A Climate for Change: Global Warming Facts for Faith-Based Decisions.'' (It was published in 2009; a new edition will come out later this year.) He is an associate professor of linguistics at Texas Tech and a pastor for their congregation, Church Without Religion.
  In her approach to discussing climate change, she declines invitations to televised arguments with those who deny the overwhelming scientific evidence that climate change is real and human activity is largely the cause. She said that such shows, with their split-screen antagonists, suggested that the two sides are evenly matched, which helps explain why Americans tell pollsters that scientists are split on the matter when it's really more like 97 percent on the side of ''it's real.''
  Some in the climate community argue that congeniality like Dr. Hayhoe's can be counterproductive, especially when well-funded deniers of climate science spread disinformation and vituperation. Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist and author at Pennsylvania State University, said locking horns has its place, too: ''There is also a role for an approach that takes bad actors to task, naming names when it comes to the worst climate villains, those who are knowingly misleading the public and policy makers. Such an approach doesn't necessarily endear oneself to the hard-core climate change deniers, but it does help to expose the deceit, and in my view it is important for the public to know about that.''
  Sitting on the back porch of her house near Lubbock on an early fall evening, Dr. Hayhoe said some of her early attempts to talk to local groups about climate change fell flat. People repeated the kinds of questions that are spread by climate denialists. Hasn't the climate always changed? How do you know it isn't the sun's energy warming the planet? Why do you put so much trust in satellite readings, which could be wrong?
  Confronted by crossed arms and closed minds, she found herself making little initial progress. ''I have had people stand up, literally shaking with rage,'' she said.
  Over time, she developed a more disarming approach that incorporated the most frequent questions into the talks. She explains that yes, the climate has always changed, but the current changes correlate convincingly with the steep rise in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. She shows that the pattern of solar cycles would have the planet cooling right now instead of warming. She argues that while the satellite readings are helpful, there are some 26,500 other measures pointing in the same direction.
  She urges her audiences to visit sites like SkepticalScience.com, which debunks denialist arguments. She tells them that climate science is actually some 200 years old, or that recent temperatures in Australia were so high that the government weather service had to introduce new colors (deep purple and pink) on its maps just to convey heat up to 129 degrees Fahrenheit. ''Isn't that crazy?''
  She counters preconceptions about her by speaking openly of her faith and of her respect for the principles of science.
  ''I don't believe in climate change,'' she said. Belief doesn't come into it; scientific verification does.
  ''Gravity doesn't care whether you believe in it or not,'' she said, ''but if you step off a cliff, you're going to go down.''

As the year ends, The New York Times asked reporters who have focused on climate change, global warming and the environment to choose the news they reported on that was the most memorable. These are their selections, ranging from sea level rise to the phenomenon of "rolling coal" to local actions to confront a warming planet.
Two other groups of reporters have also selected the articles they find most memorable: Visit this link for a roundup of science news, and this link for the year in            medical and health news.

From One Hottest Year Into the Next
The year in climate news began with a theme that is growing familiar: word that 2015 had been the warmest year on record, just beating out 2014.
The immediate cause in both cases was a powerful climate pattern, known as El Niño, in which the tropical Pacific Ocean poured an enormous amount of heat into the global atmosphere, disrupting weather patterns on every continent. But scientists said the back-to- back heat records would not have occurred without an underlying trend of global warming caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases.
That physical reality does not seem to be making much of an impression in the United States Congress, where a large number of lawmakers continue to claim that the warming trend is somehow not real, or is even the product of a global scientific hoax. But in the real world, the effects are starting to be felt as never before. As land ice melts the world over and heat absorption causes ocean water to expand, the sea level is rising. Coastal communities from Norfolk, Va., to Miami are being forced to            reckon with the consequences.
A small detail: Tidal flooding is becoming so common that towns are posting "No Wake" signs on the streets, where vehicles driving a little too fast through a foot or two of seawater can send damaging waves crashing against nearby property.
The extreme burst of global temperature records waned late in the year as the cooler La Niña weather pattern replaced El Niño in the tropical Pacific. But even so, the World Meteorological Organization predicted in November that            2016 would most likely beat 2015 to become the            record-warmest year, the first time such a global temperature record will have been set three years in a row. - Justin Gillis

Countering Denial by Being Nice
How do you talk about climate change during a presidential administration that denies it's happening?
President-elect Donald J. Trump has called climate change a hoax, and he has declared he will try to reverse the Obama administration's environmental efforts on matters ranging from the 2015 Paris climate agreement to the landmark            Clean Power Plan, intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
But while administrations change, one thing appears to be stable: Most Americans already know that climate change is real and that human activity since the Industrial Age is the major cause. Polls by the            Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found that more than half of those surveyed said that global warming is real, and only one in five disagree. But these same surveys show that Americans tend to rank the issue rather low in their priorities of urgent need for action.
The question for those trying to fight climate change, then, is how best to build on the degree of agreement that already exists and to encourage action by governments, businesses and individuals. For a very long time, these issues have been hashed out in fiery arguments between those who deny the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate science and those who try to explain the science and the reasons for strong measures. I dealt with that important question in an article about Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University who uses a gentle approach to reach the large number of Americans who are in the potentially persuadable middle. There is room for every kind of discourse, from raucous to gentle, when it comes to telling Americans about warming. But I came away from that piece with a thought that initially seemed banal, but ended up feeling profound: niceness works. - John Schwartz

Local Responses to a Changing Global Climate
Most people who think that climate change is really happening also acknowledge that humans have caused it. But getting people to actually do something about it may be the next phase in the battle to prevent catastrophic warming.
Over the course of the last year, I've spoken with people in different communities around the world who are trying to do what they can to make a difference, even if they can't see the effects.
In a small village in the English countryside, residents have been working for 10 years to make their community carbon neutral - they've insulated their homes, hung laundry out to dry and installed solar panels. Part of their success has been in their approach: This should be fun, and it should involve all of us, because all of us stand to benefit from staving off the worst effects of climate change.
They have tried to connect the global problem of climate change to normal life, because it's not always about the melting polar ice caps or apocalyptic drought. Yes, climate change is about those things, but it is also about the ways that life in the 21st century makes most people, especially those in the developed world, part of the problem.
How are your own habits connected to larger environmental problems? How much power are you still using even when you've switched off your devices?            How many plastic bottles of water do you drink every week, and how does that affect the environment and other people around you?
In the wake of the Paris agreement, most countries are involved in the fight against climate change. And while governments and power companies may make the most difference, what the rest of us - all seven billion of us - are doing matters, too. - Tatiana Schlossberg

Engines of Environmental Backlash
If there is one phenomenon that epitomizes the contempt for regulations - particularly those designed to protect the environment - among some Americans, it might be "rolling coal."
It's a fad among some diesel truck owners who soup up their engines and remove their emissions controls to belch black smoke at pedestrians, cyclists and even unsuspecting Prius drivers.
And depending on whom you ask, the fad is a juvenile prank, a health hazard, a stand against rampant environmentalism or a brazen show of American freedom. I've seen rolling coal called the "open carry" of the anti-environmentalism movement.
"Why don't you go live in Sweden and get the heck out of our country. I will continue to roll coal anytime I feel like and fog your stupid eco-cars," one angry Illinois voter wrote to a local state representative who has proposed a $5,000 fine on anyone who removes or alters emissions equipment.
At its core, rolling coal seems to me to be a symptom of a backlash against the notion that we should seek to minimize the human footprint on earth, for the sake of the environment.
It is not the only such act. Since 2007, activists have drawn attention to the environment with a call to switch off appliances worldwide during an annual Earth Hour. But since 2009, the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute - home base of            Myron Ebell, who Trump tapped for the transition at the Environmental Protection Agency - has countered with Human Achievement Hour, a call to spend that same hour keeping things on in defense of humankind's "basic human right to use energy."
Still, rolling coal goes too far even for some at the institute. Coal rollers who use their trucks for harassment, as opposed to celebration, "aren't being rebellious," said Michelle Minton, who is a fellow there. "They are just being jerks." - Hiroko Tabuchi

A Costly Effort to Make Coal Cleaner
In the deeply poor, rural county of Kemper, Mississippi, there is a project to build a first-of-its-kind power plant using technology that has been heralded as the answer to many of our climate change woes.
A poster child for the promise of so-called clean coal, the troubled plant has occupied a central role in the Obama administration's plans to counter climate change. The technology the plant is supposed to showcase is also at the center of President-elect Trump's vision for many of our energy and environmental challenges.
Producing roughly 45 percent of the emissions that cause climate change, coal is a dirty fuel source. Yet the world still relies on it for power. The Kemper project was supposed to provide a model for a new version of carbon-capture technology that could be replicated around the world.
But the Kemper power plant is more than two years past deadline and more than $4 billion over budget. The plant's owner faces credit downgrades, multiple lawsuits and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The investigation of this project unveiled an almost Shakespearean tale. In one arc we followed the prevailing public perception of the project as it shifted from hope to skepticism. In another arc we saw an engineer's personal journey from project pitchman to plant whistle-blower. Along the way, we watched a steady upward creep in the project's cost, shifting explanations the company and regulators gave for delays, and a growing intensity in the warnings from workers on site.
It all added up to more questions than answers: Did the plant's owner intentionally mislead the public, investors and regulators about the cost and timetable of the project? Why have 23 of the poorest counties in the country been saddled with costs connected to the most expensive power plant in American history? Can clean coal be replicated and built affordably and quickly enough to make it worth the investment? These questions remain. - Ian Urbina

California's Drought Is Not Over
Parts of California were relatively wet last winter, leading to a much larger snowpack in the Sierra Nevada than the year before, along with rising optimism that the state might eventually see an end to severe drought conditions that have lingered for four years.
But when I visited Yosemite National Park in April for an article about the snowpack, high spring temperatures were already melting it quickly. And there were other worrisome signs of the effects of climate change - more rain and less snow at higher elevations.
Since then, California has seen some improvement. Only 21 percent of the state is in "exceptional" drought, down from 45 percent a year ago, as reported by the            U.S. Drought Monitor, and there are even areas in the northwestern part of the state that are drought free.
But California is still in the grip of a prolonged drought, and the outlook - for the state and more broadly for the Southwest - is not promising. Forecasters say that in the short term, drier conditions may return this winter because of the weather phenomenon called La Niña. But it is the long-term situation that should be sobering for anyone who lives, or is thinking of living, in the region. Scientists say climate change has increased the risk of megadroughts, long dry periods that could make the current drought seem mild by comparison. - Henry Fountain

Climate Change and NASA's Mission on Earth
It is not easy to find out what's happening in the Arctic Ocean. If you have a few months to spare, you can board an icebreaker and chug across a small section of the sea, taking measurements. Alternatively, you can pore through the images of the North Pole that have been captured by satellites over the past few decades.
Those images tell a startling story. While month-to-month measurements can be jumpy, the overall trend has been clearly heading down. Last month, satellites measured the lowest extent of Arctic sea ice for November since satellites started keeping records in 1979.
Global warming is a driving force behind this change. As we pump more carbon into the atmosphere, scientists warn that the Arctic will lose even more ice. In a matter of decades, scientists estimated this year, the Arctic Ocean may become ice-free in the summer.
The disappearance of Arctic ice is already having a huge impact on the ocean's ecosystem. In November, a team of scientists published a new analysis of satellite data, finding that the ocean has been increasing its production of algae by some 47 percent since 1997. Scientists suspect that the size and timing of this bloom is altering the entire Arctic food web, and they're now gathering data to find out what exactly is happening.
This study was carried out as part of NASA's Earth Science program, using data largely supplied by NASA's satellites. Shortly after the it was published, reports came out that President-elect Trump's advisers are pushing to shut down NASA'sstudy of our own planet.
If we let our Earth-monitoring satellites wink out, the planet will not stop changing. The only thing that will change is our own ability to understand the Earth. - Carl Zimmer

The justices will consider challenges to Arizona’s ban on “ballot harvesting” and a suit against energy companies accused of contributing to climate change.
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, returning from its summer break, announced Friday that it would hear cases on whether voting restrictions in Arizona violated the Voting Rights Act and whether suits by state and local governments seeking to hold energy companies liable for their contributions to climate change may be heard in federal court.
The Arizona case will probably be heard in January, too late to affect the presidential election. But it will give the Supreme Court, in transition after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an opportunity to weigh in on the roiling debate over how elections should be conducted. The case will also test the force of what is left of the Voting Rights Act, which was hobbled after the court in effect struck down its central provision in 2013 in Shelby County v. Holder.
The case, Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, No. 19-1257, concerns two kinds of voting restrictions. One requires election officials to discard ballots cast at the wrong precinct.
The other makes it a crime for campaign workers, community activists and most other people to collect ballots for delivery to polling places, a practice critics call “ballot harvesting.” The law makes exceptions for family members, caregivers and election officials.
In January, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, ruled that both restrictions violated the Voting Rights Act because they disproportionately disadvantaged minority voters.
In 2016, Black, Latino and Native American voters were roughly twice as likely to cast ballots in the wrong precinct as were white voters, Judge William A. Fletcher wrote for the majority in the 7-to-4 decision. Among the reasons for this, he said, were “frequent changes in polling locations; confusing placement of polling locations; and high rates of residential mobility.”
Similarly, he wrote, the ban on ballot collectors had an outsize effect on minority voters, who use ballot collection services far more than white voters because they are more likely to to be poor, older, homebound or disabled; to lack reliable transportation, child care and mail service; and to need help understanding voting rules.
Judge Fletcher added that “there is no evidence of any fraud in the long history of third-party ballot collection in Arizona.”
In a pair of dissenting opinions, four judges wrote that the state’s restrictions were commonplace, supported by common sense and applied neutrally to all voters.
In one dissent, Judge Diarmuid O’Scannlain, writing for four judges, said lawmakers were entitled to try to prevent potential fraud. “Given its interest in addressing its valid concerns of voter fraud,” he wrote, “Arizona was free to enact prophylactic measures even though no evidence of actual voter fraud was before the legislature.”
The appeals court stayed its ruling, meaning that the restrictions will be in place for the November election.
In asking the Supreme Court to hear the case, Mark Brnovich, the state’s attorney general, a Republican, argued that the measures were sensible and that the ballot collection law was needed to address the threat of election fraud.
“The majority invalidated two commonplace election administration provisions used by Arizona and dozens of other states to prevent multiple voting, protect against voter intimidation, preserve the secrecy of the ballot and safeguard election integrity,” Mr. Brnovich wrote in his petition seeking review.
In a second development on Friday, the court agreed to hear an appeal from more than two dozen multinational energy companies that object to a state court lawsuit brought by Baltimore seeking to hold them accountable for their role in changing the earth’s climate. The companies want to move the suit to federal court
The case, BP P.L.C. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, No. 19-1189, is one of more than a dozen state and local governments around the nation have filed seeking compensation for what they said were injuries caused by the energy companies’ conduct.
In its suit, Baltimore said the companies’ “production, promotion and marketing of fossil fuel products, simultaneous concealment of the known hazards of those products and their championing of antiscience campaigns” harmed the city, which “is particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise and flooding.”
The battle, for now, is about whether the suit belongs in state court.
Judge Ellen L. Hollander of the Federal District Court in Baltimore rejected what she called the companies’ “laundry list” of reasons for trying to move the Baltimore case to federal court. Such rulings cannot ordinarily be appealed, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va., ruled in March that no exception applied.
In the Supreme Court, the energy companies argued that the issues in the case require adjudication in federal court.
“Resolution of the question presented is particularly important in the context of the ongoing nationwide climate change litigation brought by state and local governments against energy companies,” they wrote. “The question is also of substantial legal and practical importance; indeed, the question is currently arising with acute frequency in climate change lawsuits similar to this one, where the arguments for federal jurisdiction are compelling.”
The companies may be suspicious that the plaintiffs will have a home-court advantage before local judges in state court. They may also hope that federal courts will rule that federal law displaces one of the plaintiffs’ central legal theories, that the companies can be held responsible under state law for creating a public nuisance.

Highlight: It&#8217;s here, and it&#8217;s only going to get worse. So how can we formulate a sensible plan of action? 


Body


 This interview, the fourth in a series on political topics, discusses philosophical issues that underlie recent debates about climate change.  My interviewee is Dale Jamieson, a professor of environmental studies and philosophy at New York University. He is the author of "Reason in a Dark Time: Why the Struggle to Stop Climate Change Failed - and What It Means for Our Future." - Gary Gutting 
 Gary Gutting.: It's clear that global warming is an established fact, and that a good amount of it is due to human activities. But to what extent can we reliably predict how warming will affect our lives if we do little or nothing about it, or predict the effects of various policies designed to lessen its effects? In other words, does climate science have sufficient predictive reliability to be a good guide to forming public policy?
 Dale Jamieson: The difference in scale between what climate models deliver and what managers and planners need has long been a major problem. Our current models make predictions primarily expressed in terms of very abstract constructs such as "mean surface temperature" that are not very useful to decision makers. Work is advancing on regional climate models that would be more useful, but there are multiple ways of trying to build these models and they remain controversial.
 G.G.: Does this mean that we can't be reasonably sure that there will be major changes in climate that will seriously disrupt human life?
 D.J.: Unfortunately it doesn't mean that at all. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says in its most recent report that "continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems." This is a polite way of saying that we're in for species extinctions, political and social instability, millions of avoidable deaths, and the loss of the world as we know it. We know this will happen globally, that the poorest people will be most vulnerable, and we can make some reasonable predictions about broad regional impacts.
What we cannot say is how long the California drought will last or when the next hurricane will clobber New York. There are many reasons for this, but part of the difficulty is translating global-scale probabilities into local cause and effect relationships. We know that a .350 hitter is more likely to get a base hit than a .250 hitter, but that doesn't allow us to say much about what will happen to either of them at a single time at bat.
 G.G.: So it seems that climate science can tell us that we should expect big problems but can't say much about just what they will be or how best to respond to them. So how can we formulate a sensible plan of action?
 D.J.: Prudence implies that we should follow "no regrets" policies - those that are likely to make sense whatever the future holds. For example, it makes sense to move people and critical infrastructure away from vulnerable areas. When Hurricane Sandy struck New York, the areas that flooded were primarily those where wetlands had been drained or the coastline had been expanded by landfill. Whatever you think about the wisdom of such projects generally, it's pretty obvious that critical infrastructure and vulnerable people should not be located in these places, yet the city had sited hospitals and public housing projects in just those places.
Also, given the environmental and human costs entailed by the cycle of coal production and consumption, liberating ourselves from the use of coal is something we should do no matter what. The only people who could reasonably object are people who own coal companies or can't see a life beyond being dependent on those people.
 G.G.: Stopping the use of coal seems a radical step. Could you explain why you think it's necessary?
 D.J.: The cycle of coal production and consumption is destructive at every stage. It involves ripping down mountaintops, polluting waterways and killing workers. When coal is burned to produce electricity it produces pollution that kills more than 10,000 Americans each year, and more than a quarter million Chinese. In addition it does severe damage to fish, birds and waterways. And we haven't even gotten to its contribution to climate change.
Getting off coal will by difficult. Lot's of things are difficult. Quitting smoking is difficult. Abolishing slavery was almost unimaginable for people living in those societies. For centuries European and American economies depended on coerced labor.
 G.G.: Mightn't the costs of giving up coal and of using alternative fuels (maybe nuclear) be greater than the costs of continuing to use coal? Is it possible to be reasonably certain about the effects of such a major change?
 D.J. Coal seems to be an attractive fuel because there's so much of it, and our economies are set up in such a way that most of the costs are borne downstream - not by those who produce and consume it. Once you start taking these externalities into account, coal starts losing economically even to other fossil fuels such as natural gas. The environmental and health costs of coal are so overwhelming that it's not difficult to make the case for its elimination. The problem is distributional. Some people, including many poor people, gain short-term advantages from using coal. But distributional concerns are involved in all social policy decisions. The right response to these concerns is compensation, not inaction.
 G.G.: Can you give a sense of how we could go about giving up coal?
 D.J.: The key is to think about it as a process. Countries like the United States can begin the process of shutting down coal-fired electrical generating plants. The market essentially enforces this discipline once these plants are required to pay the costs that they impose on people and the environment. Essentially this is what Obama's regulations do. The "war on coal" is nothing more than a set of policies that require producers and consumers of coal to bear some of the costs that they now evade. Moving beyond coal is a much more long-term process for countries like China and India, and will require strong government policies to aid in the transition. The Chinese committed to taking these steps, and they must be encouraged not to backtrack. Recently there are signs of movement in India as well.
 G.G.: You seem to be assuming that it's too late to do anything to stop major - possibly catastrophic - effects of climate change. All that's possible is to try to minimize the damage. What about the idea that, with sufficiently decisive action, we could stop or even reverse global warming and so prevent the worst consequences?
 D.J.: We've already experienced a warming of .8°C that has resulted in serious, well-documented impacts including loss of life. The World Health Organization estimates that the health impacts of climate change already cause about 150,000 deaths per year, and this will rise to about 250,000 deaths per year by 2030. There's at least another degree baked into the system, and we're not going to stop emitting anytime soon so we're very unlikely to stay under 2°C. Almost every year since 1992 when the Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed, global emissions have increased. What makes this even worse than it sounds is that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are basically a stock problem rather than a flow problem. Think of the atmosphere as a bathtub from which water (the stock) drains very slowly. The water level can still rise even if you turn the tap (the flow) down, and when it comes to the atmosphere, we're still turning the tap up.
 G.G.: So are you saying that we can't stop climate change?
 D.J.: Climate change is here, and it's only going to get worse. But it matters how much worse it will get. It matters because the losses because of rapid warming are nonlinear, and because, according to many scientists, the harder and faster we force the system, the greater the possibility of a catastrophic disruption of the entire system. The great climate scientist Wally Broecker once said that the climate system is an angry beast and we are poking it with sticks. I would add only that if you're going to engage in this silly game, it's better to have fewer sticks being poked less aggressively.
Carbon remains in the atmosphere for centuries. Someday it may be possible for us to withdraw carbon from the atmosphere and reduce the warming. There are many unknowns about this and we are very far from being able to do it now in a safe way at a reasonable cost and on the scale required. It is better to leave the carbon in the ground than to go through the pain and expense of trying to put it back once it has been emitted.
 G.G.: Apart from scientific questions about future climate change and the effectiveness of various ways of dealing with them, there remain questions about whether the sacrifices required would be greater than the evils they prevented. Here we need judgments not only about the scientific facts but also about what we should value (and how much). Do we have the resources (from, say, economics or ethics) to answer these sorts of questions?
 D.J.: We have the resources for answering some of these questions but not others. Some decisions are more complicated and outrun our usual systems of decision making. For example, should we hold people responsible for climate change because of their ordinary but preventable emissions, such as those entailed by driving the kids to school in an S.U.V.? I think common-sense morality is at a loss when faced by questions like that, even when you supply a lot of detail about climate change. 
How should we currently value damages to people who will live 500 years in the future? How should we value anthropogenic changes to the biosphere over that period of time? These questions outrun the resources of economics to make sensible evaluations. There are other questions about adapting to a changing climate that are even more profound. Skies, sunsets, species will all be different in a world in which climate has changed. What will that do to our connection to the past and our appreciation and understanding of art, music and literature produced in a very different world?
 G.G.: Do you have suggestions for coming to terms with such questions?
 D.J.: I think we need to think ambitiously about what a morality would be like that was adequate to the problems we face in a high-population, densely interconnected world undergoing radical climate change. At the same time philosophers don't invent moralities that people then go out and adopt. We need to figure out how people can act from within their existing moral psychologies in a way that is both more environmentally friendly and will help to give them meaning in a world that is so different from the one in which most of our values were created. I've tried to develop an account of the "green virtues" as a first effort in this direction.
 G.G.: What are some of these "green virtues"?
 D.J.: The ones I discuss in my book, "Reason in a Dark Time," are cooperativeness, mindfulness, simplicity, temperance and respect for nature. They will not solve the problem of climate change on their own but they will help us to live with meaning and grace in the world that we are creating.
 G.G.: What's your view of the new movement, coming out of the Lima meeting, toward international agreements aimed at CO2 reduction?
 D.J.: International agreements matter but their importance is exaggerated. At the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 most northern environmentalists thought the solution to climate change would be an international agreement that would bind countries and force them to behave. But we don't live in a world in which such authority exists either external to nations or in their superegos. Most action on climate change will take place within regions, within countries, within communities, and in the hearts and minds of individuals. Once there has been enough change at these levels then effective agreements can be made. In a way the point is simple. When it comes to fundamental change law tends to follow politics and morality rather than leading them.

A report commissioned by President Trump's Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued dire warnings about climate change's impact on financial markets.
WASHINGTON -- A report commissioned by federal regulators overseeing the nation's commodities markets has concluded that climate change threatens U.S. financial markets, as the costs of wildfires, storms, droughts and floods spread through insurance and mortgage markets, pension funds and other financial institutions. 
  ''A world wracked by frequent and devastating shocks from climate change cannot sustain the fundamental conditions supporting our financial system,'' concluded the report, ''Managing Climate Risk in the Financial System,'' which was requested last year by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and set for release on Wednesday morning.
  Those observations are not entirely new, but they carry new weight coming with the imprimatur of the regulator of complex financial instruments like futures, swaps and other derivatives that help fix the price of commodities like corn, oil and wheat. It is the first wide-ranging federal government study focused on the specific impacts of climate change on Wall Street.
  Perhaps most notable is that it is being published at all. The Trump administration has suppressed, altered or watered down government science around climate change as it pushes an aggressive agenda of environmental deregulation that it hopes will spur economic growth.
  The new report asserts that doing nothing to avert climate change will do the opposite.
  ''This is the first time a government entity has looked at the impacts of climate change on financial markets in the U.S.,'' said Robert Litterman, the chairman of the panel that produced the report and a founding partner of Kepos Capital, an investment firm based in New York. ''Rather than saying, 'What's the science?' this is saying, 'What's the financial risk?'''
  The commodities regulator, which is made up of three Republicans and two Democrats, all of whom were appointed by President Trump, voted unanimously last summer to create an advisory panel drawn from the world of finance and charged with producing a report on the effects of the warming world on financial markets. The initial proposal for the report came from Rostin Behnam, one of the panel's two Democrats, but the report is written by dozens of analysts from investment firms including Morgan Stanley, S&P Global and Vanguard; the oil companies BP and ConocoPhillips; and the agricultural trader Cargill, as well as academic experts and environmental groups.
  It includes recommendations for new corporate regulations and the reversal of at least one Trump administration policy.
  ''It was shocking when they asked me to do this,'' Mr. Litterman said. ''This is members of the entire community involved in financial markets saying with one voice, 'This is a serious problem, and it has to be addressed.'''
  A White House spokesman, Judd Deere, declined on Tuesday to comment on the report because the White House had not yet seen it.
  Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative research organization, who served as economic adviser to John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign, said: ''This was initiated by the Trump administration. It is the only document of its type.''
  He added, ''If you're denying this exists, you don't ask for a report on it.''
  The Republican chairman of the C.F.T.C., Heath Tarbert, acknowledged the risk of climate change, but he noted that the report also detailed what the regulators called ''transition risk'' -- the financial harm that could befall the fossil fuel industry if the government enacted aggressive policies to curb carbon dioxide pollution.
  ''I appreciate Commissioner Behnam's leadership on convening various private sector perspectives on the important topic of climate risk,'' Mr. Tarbert said in a statement. ''The subcommittee's report acknowledges that 'transition risks' of a green economy could be just as disruptive to our financial system as the possible physical manifestations of climate change, and that moving too fast, too soon could be just as disorderly as doing too little, too late. This underscores why it is so important for policymakers to get this right.''
  The authors of the report acknowledged that if Mr. Trump is re-elected, his administration is all but certain to ignore the report and its recommendations.
  Instead, they said they saw the document as a policy road map for a Joseph R. Biden Jr. administration.
  Mr. Biden's climate policy proposals are the most ambitious and expensive ever embraced by a presidential candidate, and most of them would meet resistance in Congress. But even without legislation, he could press forward with regulatory changes. Lael Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor who is seen as a top contender to be Treasury secretary in a Biden administration, has called for financial regulators to treat climate change as a significant risk to the financial system.
  In calling for climate-driven policy changes, the report's authors likened the financial risk of global warming to the threat posed by the coronavirus today and by mortgage-backed securities that precipitated the financial crash in 2008.
  One crucial difference, they said, is that in the case of climate change, financial volatility and loss are likely to be spread out over time, as they hit different regions and markets. Insurance companies could withdraw from California in the wake of devastating wildfires, and home values could plummet on coastlines and in floodplains. In the Midwest, banks could limit loans during or after extended droughts that drastically lower crop yields. All of those problems will be exacerbated by climate change, but they are unlikely to hit all at once.
  ''Financial markets are really good at managing risk to help us provide credit, so that the economy can flourish,'' said Leonardo Martinez-Diaz, an editor of the report who served as senior official at the Treasury Department during the Obama administration. But, he added, the system breaks down ''when it's no longer able to manage risk, when it's invisible, it's not captured by the price of stocks.''
  ''That's what we saw in the financial crisis of 2008, and it's as relevant now on climate change as it was then on mortgage-backed securities,'' he said.
  Among the first of those risks already pervading the markets, the report's authors say, are falling home prices and rising mortgage default rates in regions where wildfires and flooding are worsening.
  ''Climate change is linked to devaluing home values,'' said Jesse Keenan, an editor of the report and a professor of real estate at Tulane University in New Orleans.
  ''If in your town, your house is devalued, that makes it harder for your local government to raise money,'' he said. ''That's one set of risks that could lead to a contagion and broader instability across financial markets.''
  Extreme weather could cause swings in agricultural commodity prices, the report warns, and climate-spurred market volatility could afflict pension and retirement funds, which invest across a range of asset classes.
  ''Climate change is one of the top three risks to our fund,'' said Divya Mankikar, an author of the report and an investment manager at the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the country's biggest public pension fund ''We pay pension and health benefits to over two million current and former state employees. So the payout is decades out.''
  The report makes several concrete recommendations for inoculating the financial system against potential harm.
  It emphasizes the need to put a price on carbon emissions, which is often done either by taxing or through an emissions trading system that caps carbon emissions and allots credits that polluters can buy and sell under that cap.
  The report calls for the reversal of a proposed rule being put forward by the Trump administration's Labor Department that would forbid retirement investment managers from considering environmental consequences in their financial recommendations.
  ''If there's any class of investors that should be thinking about the long run, it's retirement funds and pension funds,'' said Nathaniel Keohane, an author of the report and an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group.
  The report suggests that the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a Treasury Department-led body created in the wake of the 2008 crisis, incorporates climate risks into its annual report and its communications with Congress. It suggests that the Federal Reserve and other major financial regulators join international coalitions that focus on climate threats.
  The report also suggests that bank regulators should roll out a climate risk stress testing pilot program. Such stress tests, which assess how bank balance sheets and the broader system would fare in bad climate-related economic scenarios, have been under development in Britain and elsewhere in Europe.
  The authors also recommend that another financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, strengthen its existing requirements that publicly traded companies disclose the risks to their bottom lines associated with climate change.
  Coca-Cola has noted in its financial disclosures that water shortages driven by climate change pose a risk to its production chains and profitability. But many other companies ''just check the box'' on that requirement, Mr. Keohane said.
  Such disclosures should also include the risk to companies' bottom lines posed by future policies designed to mitigate climate change, such as taxes or regulations on carbon dioxide pollution, which could hurt fossil fuel producers.
  ''If carbon risk is priced, this will add cost to the oil and gas industry,'' said Betty Simkins, a report author and professor of finance at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater. ''But they need to be prepared for this. It's better for the companies to disclose the risk and be as financially fit as possible.''

The country debates women’s honor inexhaustibly but pays little attention to the ferocious and imminent dangers of climate disasters.
Karachi is home. My bustling, chaotic city of about 20 million people on the Arabian Sea is an ethnically and religiously diverse metropolis and the commercial capital of Pakistan, generating more than half of the country’s revenue.
Over the decades, Karachi has survived violent sectarian strife, political violence between warring groups claiming the city and terrorism. Karachi has survived its gangsters sparring with rocket launchers; its police force, more feared than common criminals; its rulers and bureaucrats committed to rapacious, bottomless corruption. Now Karachi faces its most terrifying adversary: climate change.
In August, Karachi’s stifling summer heat was heavy and pregnant. The sapodilla trees and frangipani leaves were lush and green; the Arabian Sea, quiet and distant, had grown muddy. When the palm fronds started to sway, slowly, the city knew the winds had picked up and rain would follow. Every year the monsoons come — angrier and wilder — lashing the unprepared city. Studies show that climate change is causing monsoons to be more intense and less predictable, and cover larger areas of land for longer periods of time.
On Aug. 27, Karachi received nearly nine inches of monsoon rain, the highest amount of rainfall ever in a single day. Nineteen inches of rain fell in August, according to the meteorological officials. It is enough to drown a city that has no functioning drainage, no emergency systems and no reliable health care (except for those who can pay). Thousands of homes and settlements of the poor were subsumed and destroyed, and more than 100 people were killed.
A traders association estimated that the submerging of markets and warehouses damaged goods worth 25 billion Pakistani rupees, or about $150 million. Local papers estimated that with Karachi at a standstill for a week, in some congested areas for longer, Pakistan’s gross domestic product suffered daily losses of $449 million — a number that didn’t include the enormous informal economy. The World Bank estimates that 15 percent of gross domestic product of the Sindh province (Karachi is its capital) is lost every year to environmental damage and climate change.
Pakistan is the fifth most climate vulnerable nation in the world. Between 1998 and 2018, according to the Global Climate Risk Index, the country is estimated to have lost nearly 10,000 lives to climate-related disasters and suffered losses amounting to about $4 billion from 152 extreme weather events in that period. Analysts have estimated Pakistan’s climate migrants over the past decade at around 30 million people.
There is no end to the catalog of climate disasters affecting my country. The glaciers in the Hindu Kush, the Himalayas and the Karakoram in northern Pakistan are melting at an accelerated pace. If the emission trends and temperature rises continue unabated, these mountains could lose between a third to two-thirds of their ice fields by 2100. The result will be catastrophic: By 2050, the increased melting will result in landslides, heavy flooding, dam bursts and soil erosion. After the glaciers have melted away, drought and famine will follow.
The terror of our coming era will be born of heat and fire and ice. Some years ago, I was in a village in Sindh after a massive flood had devastated it. Thousands were displaced overnight. The blistering heat soaked the faces of displaced young women in sweat thick like glycerin. I was unsure what would be more lethal — the drowning or the heat.
Not far from that drowned village in Sindh is the city of Jacobabad, where temperatures in the summer run as high as 124 degrees Fahrenheit. It is the hottest city in Asia, if not the world. Jacobabad has long electricity blackouts. Its poor die as they toil in the fields.
Temperature increases have brought plague after plague in rural areas. This year has brought Pakistan the most devastating locust infestations in nearly 30 years. The insects destroyed entire harvests, causing the government to call a national emergency as winter crops were decimated, resulting in losses of $2.5 billion. The locusts descend like a haze, so thick that from a distance it looked like a soft pink fog. Because of heavy rains and cyclones, there has been unprecedented breeding of locusts in the United Arab Emirates. They traveled to us from the Arabian Peninsula.
This is a climate war between the large industrial superpowers, financial predators that have polluted and poisoned our planet for profit, and the poor, who have done the least damage but will pay all of the consequences. Pakistan is responsible for less than 1 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, but its people will bear the burden of the world’s deadliest polluters. If nothing is done to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the World Bank, 800 million people in South Asia will be at risk of amplified poverty, homelessness and hunger.
The World Bank has identified Karachi as one the planet’s climate hot spots. Temperatures across South Asia are estimated to rise by 3.9 degrees Fahrenheit in the next 30 years. Karachi is already struggling with poor road connectivity, dire educational facilities and limited market access. Its already pathetic public health system will plummet. The rich might buy generators for electricity, pay for water tanks and rely on expensive hospitals, but the poor will continue to be devastated.
Pakistan’s current government is speaking about climate change, but it is a conversation that has come too late, unaccompanied by serious action. In 1947, Pakistan was 33 percent forest. Today, we have tree cover of just about 4 percent, all because of deforestation. This destruction, largely caused by the illegal logging by timber mafias, has silted up our waterways and left us undefended against floods and storms.
The country can easily be whipped into hysteria over supposed religious infractions committed by minorities and can debate women’s modesty and honor inexhaustibly, but it has little attention for the ferocious and imminent dangers of climate change.
Karachi’s rainfall, like the rising temperatures, is a consequence of the raging climate war. We have sat by and watched how cities die: slowly. We didn’t watch closely enough when the villages sank and struggled. But it is clear now that this is how a planet burns, one fire at a time, one degree hotter until eventually all that remains will be the chalky bones of Karachi’s ancient saints, buried on disappeared cliffs.

Highlight: Mutual funds are investing in companies that can help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and aid in adaptation to climate change.

For investors, the risks of climate change are already raging, with intense storms and wildfires leading to property damage and business disruption.
California’s deadly fires last year resulted in losses of tens of billions of dollars — and may have contributed to the January            bankruptcy of Pacific Gas and Electric, the electric utility. “The risk of catastrophic fire has increased in California, and the reason is climate change,” said Julie K. Gorte, senior vice president for sustainable investing at Pax World Funds.
But the investment opportunities, beyond renewable energy, have received less attention. Nonetheless, a few mutual funds have made it their mission to invest in companies that can help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions or aid adaptation to a warmer world.
They’re stepping beyond what have been the main investment responses to climate change — betting narrowly on green energy, like wind and solar power, or avoiding the worst polluters, like oil and coal companies, in            low-carbon mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.
“More and more clients, individuals and institutions, are asking for funds that address climate change and climate risk,” said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Capital Management in Boston. “Because of that, asset managers are starting to develop portfolios to meet that demand.”
The Hartford Environmental Opportunities Fund is one such fund. It’s not just “about the weather,” said Alan T. Hsu, portfolio manager. “It’s about technology and assets being created today to address climate-related risks that are visible already.” The fund, with a net expense ratio of 0.89 percent, returned an annual average of 6.51 percent over the three years through March.
More than half the fund’s assets are invested in companies involved in low-carbon electricity and energy efficiency, such as Iberdrola, a Spanish utility that relies on wind power. But holdings also include water and agriculture stocks, such as Deere & Company, the farm-equipment maker.
“In a world with a more adverse climate, a lot of arable land will become much less productive at the same time as population increases the demand on that land,” Mr. Hsu said. Outfits that can help farmers increase fertility stand to benefit.
Mr. Hsu works for Wellington Management in Boston. Hartford Funds hired Wellington to run the fund, which opened in 2016. Mr. Hsu said Wellington created the strategy a decade ago for its institutional investor clients, like pension funds, because it expected the federal government to begin regulating carbon emissions in the United States. That didn’t happen, but regulation has surged in states, cities and other countries.
“Since 1997, the year of the Kyoto climate protocol, the number of climate laws and policies in the world has basically doubled every five years. There were more than 1,200 by early 2017,” Mr. Hsu said. Those rules present legal-liability risk and the possibility of higher costs for companies, he said. The Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement to limit greenhouse-gas emissions.
In stewarding the Hartford fund, Mr. Hsu can draw on insights from a research partnership that Wellington created last year with the Woods Hole Research Center, a nonprofit climate specialist in Falmouth, Mass. The two are merging market know-how and climate science to identify metrics that matter for investing. Wellington, which manages funds for other companies, including Vanguard, says the partnership’s findings will inform all the portfolios it runs, not just the Hartford fund.
Jon F. Hale, global head of sustainability research for Morningstar, said he wasn’t aware of another pairing like that between Wellington and Woods Hole — plenty of money managers have begun to talk about climate change, but none have so publicly allied themselves with an independent scientific expert. Mr. Hale predicted that other big investment companies would find themselves at a disadvantage if they didn’t seek comparable means of assessing the investment implications of a warmer world.
“They have to figure out the extent to which climate change poses a direct and immediate risk to their portfolios,” he said.
An early line of inquiry in the Wellington-Woods Hole partnership is how higher temperatures may induce population migration, said Philip B. Duffy, Woods Hole’s president and executive director. “Of all of the different hazards, drought seems to be one that’s particularly powerful in inducing migration,” he said. “If there’s not water, you can’t live somewhere.”
The financial implications of that could play out in surprising ways, said Christopher J. Goolgasian, Wellington’s director of climate research. Movable assets might become more valuable than stationary ones. “You might think about cruise ships over theme parks and farm equipment over farms,” he said.
Or you might consider investing in nontraditional sorts of farms — which is why aquaculture is one of the themes of the GMO Climate Change Fund. Its manager, Lucas White, includes in the fund less obvious industries, like fish farming and copper mining, alongside obvious ones, like clean energy and energy efficiency. Mr. White’s fund caters to institutional investors like pension funds and has returned an annual average of 8.54 percent since its April 2017 inception through February 2018, the latest information available from the fund.
“If you think agricultural productivity will be challenged, people will need to get their protein from somewhere,” he said. “Cattle is a disaster for climate change, but salmon is very carbon efficient.” Cows produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and tropical forests, which absorb carbon dioxide, are often razed for ranching.
Mr. White’s allocation to copper stocks is a sideways play on renewable energy. Some environmentally minded investors avoid miners, because of the pollution and political controversies that can accompany their operations. Mr. White, in contrast, bets big, allocating about 10 percent of his fund to copper diggers, including Freeport-McMoRan.
“We need an immense amount of copper to respond to climate change,” he said. The metal is required for wind and solar projects, as well as electric-vehicle-charging networks.
Not every manager in this niche views renewable energy as a crucial play. The Pax Global Environmental Markets Fund mostly avoids the sector. Instead, it holds big slugs of agriculture and water stocks; together, those total more than 40 percent of its assets.
That’s partly because the fund’s mandate is broader than just responding to global warming, said co-manager Hubert T. Aarts. “Some of what we hold is purely climate related, but the portfolio is not only that,” he said. The fund also buys companies that help deliver cleaner water and air and dispose of waste.
“You want to breathe fresh air even without climate change,” he said. The fund, with a net expense ratio of 0.98 percent, returned an annual average of 10.36 percent over the three years through March.
Few mutual funds explicitly make climate change the core of their mandate, Mr. Hale of Morningstar said. But investors can find offerings with an ecological bent among those that more broadly incorporate environmental, social and governance factors into their stock picking, he said.
An example is Brown Advisory’s Sustainable Growth Fund. As the name suggests, the fund invests in companies its managers judge as having sustainable business practices and good long-term growth prospects. That makes climate change part of the calculus, said co-manager Karina Funk. “If you want your company to thrive over the next 20 years, you absolutely need to be thinking about climate change,” she said.
Ms. Funk said she and her co-manager, David B. Powell, investigate companies’ sustainability records because the best-run companies have forward-looking environmental practices, in addition to solid fundamentals.
As an example, she offered up one of her fund’s largest holdings, J. B. Hunt Transport Services, the freight company. “They have a high carbon footprint, and yet they’re way less carbon intensive than their peers,” she said. “They use trains for a lot of the shipping journey, and that can be up to 50 percent more fuel efficient than over-the-road trucking.” Ms. Funk’s fund, with an expense ratio of 0.88 percent, returned an annual average of 18.84 percent over the three years through March.
Active fund managers may have an advantage in this niche, compared with index funds and E.T.F.s. They may be able to identify and exploit the new risks and opportunities presented by a warming world and wilder weather, said Matthew C. Brancato, a principal at Vanguard. Assessing environmental performance from an investment perspective is a relatively new endeavor, so there aren’t standard approaches or measures, he said. That can create an opening for research to yield valuable insights.
On top of that, active managers are more likely to ask companies to improve their environmental practices, he said. (There is at least one index offering with a climate focus, the ETHO Climate Leadership U.S. E.T.F.)
Whether one chooses an active or passively managed fund, costs matter in this niche, as in any other, Mr. Brancato said. Even if an actively managed fund outperforms competitors, high costs can erase its advantage.
Another consideration is how much of a portfolio to dedicate to a specialized fund. Michelle E. Brownstein, vice president of private client services at Personal Capital in San Francisco, said she wouldn’t recommend that someone put more than 10 percent of their total investments into such a fund. Her recommendation assumes that person has a well-diversified portfolio and that the fund chosen is low cost, she said. “Socially responsible funds tend to be a little more expensive than other strategies, and they shouldn’t be.”
For some investors, climate change isn’t just a money problem but also a moral one; these folks want their money to help the transition to a greener economy. Investment companies are aware of that and increasingly offer funds and E.T.F.s that let shareholders express their values in this way.
Dimensional Fund Advisors offered its first two sustainable funds more than a decade ago. They aim to buy the best environmental performers in each economic sector, said Gerard K. O’Reilly, the company’s co-chief executive and chief investment officer.
Mr. O’Reilly said he’s not convinced a sustainable strategy can outperform the broader market. “Investors can account for firms’ social and sustainable practices without meaningfully changing the expected return of their portfolios,” he said. Dimensional’s funds have kept pace with their benchmark indexes. Its U.S. Sustainability Core 1 Portfolio, with an expense ratio of 0.25 percent, returned an annual average of 13.18 percent for the three years through March, compared with 13.48 percent for the Russell 3000 index.
He added that he saw nothing wrong with investing with the hope of achieving good returns while helping along the climate transition.
“Customers have the right to express their preferences around what kind of investments they want to make. Will that action help get companies to pay more attention to sustainability? Well, every little bit helps.”

Its manager, Lucas White, includes in the fund less obvious industries, like fish farming and copper mining, alongside obvious ones, like clean energy and energy efficiency. Mr. White's fund caters to institutional investors like pension funds and has returned an annual average of 8.54 percent since its April 2017 inception through February 2018, the latest information available from the fund.
  ''If you think agricultural productivity will be challenged, people will need to get their protein from somewhere,'' he said. ''Cattle is a disaster for climate change, but salmon is very carbon efficient.'' Cows produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and tropical forests, which absorb carbon dioxide, are often razed for ranching.
  Mr. White's allocation to copper stocks is a sideways play on renewable energy. Some environmentally minded investors avoid miners, because of the pollution and political controversies that can accompany their operations. Mr. White, in contrast, bets big, allocating about 10 percent of his fund to copper diggers, including Freeport-McMoRan.
  ''We need an immense amount of copper to respond to climate change,'' he said. The metal is required for wind and solar projects, as well as electric-vehicle-charging networks.
  Not every manager in this niche views renewable energy as a crucial play. The Pax Global Environmental Markets Fund mostly avoids the sector. Instead, it holds big slugs of agriculture and water stocks; together, those total more than 40 percent of its assets.
  That's partly because the fund's mandate is broader than just responding to global warming, said co-manager Hubert T. Aarts. ''Some of what we hold is purely climate related, but the portfolio is not only that,'' he said. The fund also buys companies that help deliver cleaner water and air and dispose of waste.
  ''You want to breathe fresh air even without climate change,'' he said. The fund, with a net expense ratio of 0.98 percent, returned an annual average of 10.36 percent over the three years through March.
  Few mutual funds explicitly make climate change the core of their mandate, Mr. Hale of Morningstar said. But investors can find offerings with an ecological bent among those that more broadly incorporate environmental, social and governance factors into their stock picking, he said.
  An example is Brown Advisory's Sustainable Growth Fund. As the name suggests, the fund invests in companies its managers judge as having sustainable business practices and good long-term growth prospects. That makes climate change part of the calculus, said co-manager Karina Funk. ''If you want your company to thrive over the next 20 years, you absolutely need to be thinking about climate change,'' she said.
  Ms. Funk said she and her co-manager, David B. Powell, investigate companies' sustainability records because the best-run companies have forward-looking environmental practices, in addition to solid fundamentals.
  As an example, she offered up one of her fund's largest holdings, J. B. Hunt Transport Services, the freight company. ''They have a high carbon footprint, and yet they're way less carbon intensive than their peers,'' she said. ''They use trains for a lot of the shipping journey, and that can be up to 50 percent more fuel efficient than over-the-road trucking.'' Ms. Funk's fund, with an expense ratio of 0.88 percent, returned an annual average of 18.84 percent over the three years through March.
  Active fund managers may have an advantage in this niche, compared with index funds and E.T.F.s. They may be able to identify and exploit the new risks and opportunities presented by a warming world and wilder weather, said Matthew C. Brancato, a principal at Vanguard. Assessing environmental performance from an investment perspective is a relatively new endeavor, so there aren't standard approaches or measures, he said. That can create an opening for research to yield valuable insights.
  On top of that, active managers are more likely to ask companies to improve their environmental practices, he said. (There is at least one index offering with a climate focus, the ETHO Climate Leadership U.S. E.T.F.)
  Whether one chooses an active or passively managed fund, costs matter in this niche, as in any other, Mr. Brancato said. Even if an actively managed fund outperforms competitors, high costs can erase its advantage.
  Another consideration is how much of a portfolio to dedicate to a specialized fund. Michelle E. Brownstein, vice president of private client services at Personal Capital in San Francisco, said she wouldn't recommend that someone put more than 10 percent of their total investments into such a fund. Her recommendation assumes that person has a well-diversified portfolio and that the fund chosen is low cost, she said. ''Socially responsible funds tend to be a little more expensive than other strategies, and they shouldn't be.''
  For some investors, climate change isn't just a money problem but also a moral one; these folks want their money to help the transition to a greener economy. Investment companies are aware of that and increasingly offer funds and E.T.F.s that let shareholders express their values in this way.
  Dimensional Fund Advisors offered its first two sustainable funds more than a decade ago. They aim to buy the best environmental performers in each economic sector, said Gerard K. O'Reilly, the company's co-chief executive and chief investment officer.
  Mr. O'Reilly said he's not convinced a sustainable strategy can outperform the broader market. ''Investors can account for firms' social and sustainable practices without meaningfully changing the expected return of their portfolios,'' he said. Dimensional's funds have kept pace with their benchmark indexes. Its U.S. Sustainability Core 1 Portfolio, with an expense ratio of 0.25 percent, returned an annual average of 13.18 percent for the three years through March, compared with 13.48 percent for the Russell 3000 index.
  He added that he saw nothing wrong with investing with the hope of achieving good returns while helping along the climate transition.
  ''Customers have the right to express their preferences around what kind of investments they want to make. Will that action help get companies to pay more attention to sustainability? Well, every little bit helps.''

Body


A report commissioned by President Trump’s Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued dire warnings about climate change’s impact on financial markets.
WASHINGTON — A report commissioned by federal regulators overseeing the nation’s commodities markets has concluded that climate change threatens U.S. financial markets, as the costs of wildfires, storms, droughts and floods spread through insurance and mortgage markets, pension funds and other financial institutions.
“A world wracked by frequent and devastating shocks from climate change cannot sustain the fundamental conditions supporting our financial system,” concluded the report, “Managing Climate Risk in the Financial System,” which was requested last year by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and set for release on Wednesday morning.
Those observations are not entirely new, but they carry new weight coming with the imprimatur of the regulator of complex financial instruments like futures, swaps and other derivatives that help fix the price of commodities like corn, oil and wheat. It is the first wide-ranging federal government study focused on the specific impacts of climate change on Wall Street.
Perhaps most notable is that it is being published at all. The Trump administration has suppressed, altered or watered down government science around climate change as it pushes an aggressive agenda of environmental deregulation that it hopes will spur economic growth.
The new report asserts that doing nothing to avert climate change will do the opposite.
“This is the first time a government entity has looked at the impacts of climate change on financial markets in the U.S.,” said Robert Litterman, the chairman of the panel that produced the report and a founding partner of Kepos Capital, an investment firm based in New York. “Rather than saying, ‘What’s the science?’ this is saying, ‘What’s the financial risk?’”
The commodities regulator, which is made up of three Republicans and two Democrats, all of whom were appointed by President Trump, voted unanimously last summer to create an advisory panel drawn from the world of finance and charged with producing a report on the effects of the warming world on financial markets. The initial proposal for the report came from Rostin Behnam, one of the panel’s two Democrats, but the report is written by dozens of analysts from investment firms including Morgan Stanley, S&amp;P Global and Vanguard; the oil companies BP and ConocoPhillips; and the agricultural trader Cargill, as well as academic experts and environmental groups.
It includes recommendations for new corporate regulations and the reversal of at least one Trump administration policy.
“It was shocking when they asked me to do this,” Mr. Litterman said. “This is members of the entire community involved in financial markets saying with one voice, ‘This is a serious problem, and it has to be addressed.’”
A senior White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that while the full commission had voted to produce the report, it has not yet voted to endorse its findings. “It doesn’t represent the position of the C.F.T.C. and is not an official government report,” the official said. 
The C.F.T.C. subcommittee that authored the report did vote unanimously to endorse it, and it is published on the commission’s website.
Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a conservative research organization, who served as economic adviser to John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, said: “This was initiated by the Trump administration. It is the only document of its type.”
He added, “If you’re denying this exists, you don’t ask for a report on it.”
The Republican chairman of the C.F.T.C., Heath Tarbert, acknowledged the risk of climate change, but he noted that the report also detailed what the regulators called “transition risk” — the financial harm that could befall the fossil fuel industry if the government enacted aggressive policies to curb carbon dioxide pollution.
“I appreciate Commissioner Behnam’s leadership on convening various private sector perspectives on the important topic of climate risk,” Mr. Tarbert said in a statement. “The subcommittee’s report acknowledges that ‘transition risks’ of a green economy could be just as disruptive to our financial system as the possible physical manifestations of climate change, and that moving too fast, too soon could be just as disorderly as doing too little, too late. This underscores why it is so important for policymakers to get this right.”
Some of the authors of the report acknowledged that if Mr. Trump is re-elected, his administration is all but certain to ignore the report and its recommendations.
Instead, they said they saw the document as a policy road map for a Joseph R. Biden Jr. administration.
Mr. Biden’s climate policy proposals are the most ambitious and expensive ever embraced by a presidential candidate, and most of them would meet resistance in Congress. But even without legislation, he could press forward with regulatory changes. Lael Brainard, a Federal Reserve governor who is seen as a top contender to be Treasury secretary in a Biden administration, has called for financial regulators to treat climate change as a significant risk to the financial system.
In calling for climate-driven policy changes, the report’s authors likened the financial risk of global warming to the threat posed by the coronavirus today and by mortgage-backed securities that precipitated the financial crash in 2008.
One crucial difference, they said, is that in the case of climate change, financial volatility and loss are likely to be spread out over time, as they hit different regions and markets. Insurance companies could withdraw from California in the wake of devastating wildfires, and home values could plummet on coastlines and in floodplains. In the Midwest, banks could limit loans during or after extended droughts that drastically lower crop yields. All of those problems will be exacerbated by climate change, but they are unlikely to hit all at once.
“Financial markets are really good at managing risk to help us provide credit, so that the economy can flourish,” said Leonardo Martinez-Diaz, an editor of the report who served as senior official at the Treasury Department during the Obama administration. But, he added, the system breaks down “when it’s no longer able to manage risk, when it’s invisible, it’s not captured by the price of stocks.”
“That’s what we saw in the financial crisis of 2008, and it’s as relevant now on climate change as it was then on mortgage-backed securities,” he said.
Among the first of those risks already pervading the markets, the report’s authors say, are falling home prices and rising mortgage default rates in regions where wildfires and flooding are worsening.
“Climate change is linked to devaluing home values,” said Jesse Keenan, an editor of the report and a professor of real estate at Tulane University in New Orleans.
“If in your town, your house is devalued, that makes it harder for your local government to raise money,” he said. “That’s one set of risks that could lead to a contagion and broader instability across financial markets.”
Extreme weather could cause swings in agricultural commodity prices, the report warns, and climate-spurred market volatility could afflict pension and retirement funds, which invest across a range of asset classes.
“Climate change is one of the top three risks to our fund,” said Divya Mankikar, an author of the report and an investment manager at the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, the country’s biggest public pension fund “We pay pension and health benefits to over two million current and former state employees. So the payout is decades out.”
The report makes several concrete recommendations for inoculating the financial system against potential harm.
It emphasizes the need to put a price on carbon emissions, which is often done either by taxing or through an emissions trading system that caps carbon emissions and allots credits that polluters can buy and sell under that cap.
The report calls for the reversal of a proposed rule being put forward by the Trump administration’s Labor Department that would forbid retirement investment managers from considering environmental consequences in their financial recommendations.
“If there’s any class of investors that should be thinking about the long run, it’s retirement funds and pension funds,” said Nathaniel Keohane, an author of the report and an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group.
The report suggests that the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a Treasury Department-led body created in the wake of the 2008 crisis, incorporates climate risks into its annual report and its communications with Congress. It suggests that the Federal Reserve and other major financial regulators join international coalitions that focus on climate threats.
The report also suggests that bank regulators should roll out a climate risk stress testing pilot program. Such stress tests, which assess how bank balance sheets and the broader system would fare in bad climate-related economic scenarios, have been under development in Britain and elsewhere in Europe.
The authors also recommend that another financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, strengthen its existing requirements that publicly traded companies disclose the risks to their bottom lines associated with climate change.
Coca-Cola has noted in its financial disclosures that water shortages driven by climate change pose a risk to its production chains and profitability. But many other companies “just check the box” on that requirement, Mr. Keohane said.
Such disclosures should also include the risk to companies’ bottom lines posed by future policies designed to mitigate climate change, such as taxes or regulations on carbon dioxide pollution, which could hurt fossil fuel producers.
“If carbon risk is priced, this will add cost to the oil and gas industry,” said Betty Simkins, a report author and professor of finance at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater. “But they need to be prepared for this. It’s better for the companies to disclose the risk and be as financially fit as possible.”

As the year ends, The New York Times asked reporters who have focused on climate change, global warming and the environment to choose the news they reported on that was the most memorable. These are their selections, ranging from sea level rise to the phenomenon of ''rolling coal'' to local actions to confront a warming planet.
Two other groups of reporters have also selected the articles they find most memorable: Visit this link for a roundup of science news, and this link for the year in medical and health news. 
  _____
  From One Hottest Year Into the Next
  The year in climate news began with a theme that is growing familiar: word that 2015 had been the warmest year on record, just beating out 2014.
  The immediate cause in both cases was a powerful climate pattern, known as El Niño, in which the tropical Pacific Ocean poured an enormous amount of heat into the global atmosphere, disrupting weather patterns on every continent. But scientists said the back-to- back heat records would not have occurred without an underlying trend of global warming caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases.
  That physical reality does not seem to be making much of an impression in the United States Congress, where a large number of lawmakers continue to claim that the warming trend is somehow not real, or is even the product of a global scientific hoax. But in the real world, the effects are starting to be felt as never before. As land ice melts the world over and heat absorption causes ocean water to expand, the sea level is rising. Coastal communities from Norfolk, Va., to Miami are being forced to reckon with the consequences.
  A small detail: Tidal flooding is becoming so common that towns are posting ''No Wake'' signs on the streets, where vehicles driving a little too fast through a foot or two of seawater can send damaging waves crashing against nearby property.
  The extreme burst of global temperature records waned late in the year as the cooler La Niña weather pattern replaced El Niño in the tropical Pacific. But even so, the World Meteorological Organization predicted in November that 2016 would most likely beat 2015 to become the record-warmest year, the first time such a global temperature record will have been set three years in a row. -- Justin Gillis

  Countering Denial by Being Nice
  How do you talk about climate change during a presidential administration that denies it's happening?
  President-elect Donald J. Trump has called climate change a hoax, and he has declared he will try to reverse the Obama administration's environmental efforts on matters ranging from the 2015 Paris climate agreement to the landmark Clean Power Plan, intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
  But while administrations change, one thing appears to be stable: Most Americans already know that climate change is real and that human activity since the Industrial Age is the major cause. Polls by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found that more than half of those surveyed said that global warming is real, and only one in five disagree. But these same surveys show that Americans tend to rank the issue rather low in their priorities of urgent need for action.
  The question for those trying to fight climate change, then, is how best to build on the degree of agreement that already exists and to encourage action by governments, businesses and individuals. For a very long time, these issues have been hashed out in fiery arguments between those who deny the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate science and those who try to explain the science and the reasons for strong measures. I dealt with that important question in an article about Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University who uses a gentle approach to reach the large number of Americans who are in the potentially persuadable middle. There is room for every kind of discourse, from raucous to gentle, when it comes to telling Americans about warming. But I came away from that piece with a thought that initially seemed banal, but ended up feeling profound: niceness works. -- John Schwartz

  Local Responses to a Changing Global Climate
  Most people who think that climate change is really happening also acknowledge that humans have caused it. But getting people to actually do something about it may be the next phase in the battle to prevent catastrophic warming.
  Over the course of the last year, I've spoken with people in different communities around the world who are trying to do what they can to make a difference, even if they can't see the effects.
  In a small village in the English countryside, residents have been working for 10 years to make their community carbon neutral -- they've insulated their homes, hung laundry out to dry and installed solar panels. Part of their success has been in their approach: This should be fun, and it should involve all of us, because all of us stand to benefit from staving off the worst effects of climate change.
  They have tried to connect the global problem of climate change to normal life, because it's not always about the melting polar ice caps or apocalyptic drought. Yes, climate change is about those things, but it is also about the ways that life in the 21st century makes most people, especially those in the developed world, part of the problem.
  How are your own habits connected to larger environmental problems? How much power are you still using even when you've switched off your devices? How many plastic bottles of water do you drink every week, and how does that affect the environment and other people around you?
  In the wake of the Paris agreement, most countries are involved in the fight against climate change. And while governments and power companies may make the most difference, what the rest of us -- all seven billion of us -- are doing matters, too. -- Tatiana Schlossberg

  Engines of Environmental Backlash
  If there is one phenomenon that epitomizes the contempt for regulations -- particularly those designed to protect the environment -- among some Americans, it might be ''rolling coal.''
  It's a fad among some diesel truck owners who soup up their engines and remove their emissions controls to belch black smoke at pedestrians, cyclists and even unsuspecting Prius drivers.
  And depending on whom you ask, the fad is a juvenile prank, a health hazard, a stand against rampant environmentalism or a brazen show of American freedom. I've seen rolling coal called the ''open carry'' of the anti-environmentalism movement.
  ''Why don't you go live in Sweden and get the heck out of our country. I will continue to roll coal anytime I feel like and fog your stupid eco-cars,'' one angry Illinois voter wrote to a local state representative who has proposed a $5,000 fine on anyone who removes or alters emissions equipment.
  At its core, rolling coal seems to me to be a symptom of a backlash against the notion that we should seek to minimize the human footprint on earth, for the sake of the environment.
  It is not the only such act. Since 2007, activists have drawn attention to the environment with a call to switch off appliances worldwide during an annual Earth Hour. But since 2009, the libertarian Competitive Enterprise Institute -- home base of Myron Ebell, who Trump tapped for the transition at the Environmental Protection Agency -- has countered with Human Achievement Hour, a call to spend that same hour keeping things on in defense of humankind's ''basic human right to use energy.''
  Still, rolling coal goes too far even for some at the institute. Coal rollers who use their trucks for harassment, as opposed to celebration, ''aren't being rebellious,'' said Michelle Minton, who is a fellow there. ''They are just being jerks.'' -- Hiroko Tabuchi

  A Costly Effort to Make Coal Cleaner
  In the deeply poor, rural county of Kemper, Mississippi, there is a project to build a first-of-its-kind power plant using technology that has been heralded as the answer to many of our climate change woes.
  A poster child for the promise of so-called clean coal, the troubled plant has occupied a central role in the Obama administration's plans to counter climate change. The technology the plant is supposed to showcase is also at the center of President-elect Trump's vision for many of our energy and environmental challenges.
  Producing roughly 45 percent of the emissions that cause climate change, coal is a dirty fuel source. Yet the world still relies on it for power. The Kemper project was supposed to provide a model for a new version of carbon-capture technology that could be replicated around the world.
  But the Kemper power plant is more than two years past deadline and more than $4 billion over budget. The plant's owner faces credit downgrades, multiple lawsuits and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
  The investigation of this project unveiled an almost Shakespearean tale. In one arc we followed the prevailing public perception of the project as it shifted from hope to skepticism. In another arc we saw an engineer's personal journey from project pitchman to plant whistle-blower. Along the way, we watched a steady upward creep in the project's cost, shifting explanations the company and regulators gave for delays, and a growing intensity in the warnings from workers on site.
  It all added up to more questions than answers: Did the plant's owner intentionally mislead the public, investors and regulators about the cost and timetable of the project? Why have 23 of the poorest counties in the country been saddled with costs connected to the most expensive power plant in American history? Can clean coal be replicated and built affordably and quickly enough to make it worth the investment? These questions remain. -- Ian Urbina

  California's Drought Is Not Over
  Parts of California were relatively wet last winter, leading to a much larger snowpack in the Sierra Nevada than the year before, along with rising optimism that the state might eventually see an end to severe drought conditions that have lingered for four years.
  But when I visited Yosemite National Park in April for an article about the snowpack, high spring temperatures were already melting it quickly. And there were other worrisome signs of the effects of climate change -- more rain and less snow at higher elevations.
  Since then, California has seen some improvement. Only 21 percent of the state is in ''exceptional'' drought, down from 45 percent a year ago, as reported by the U.S. Drought Monitor, and there are even areas in the northwestern part of the state that are drought free.
  But California is still in the grip of a prolonged drought, and the outlook -- for the state and more broadly for the Southwest -- is not promising. Forecasters say that in the short term, drier conditions may return this winter because of the weather phenomenon called La Niña. But it is the long-term situation that should be sobering for anyone who lives, or is thinking of living, in the region. Scientists say climate change has increased the risk of megadroughts, long dry periods that could make the current drought seem mild by comparison. -- Henry Fountain

  Climate Change and NASA's Mission on Earth
  It is not easy to find out what's happening in the Arctic Ocean. If you have a few months to spare, you can board an icebreaker and chug across a small section of the sea, taking measurements. Alternatively, you can pore through the images of the North Pole that have been captured by satellites over the past few decades.
  Those images tell a startling story. While month-to-month measurements can be jumpy, the overall trend has been clearly heading down. Last month, satellites measured the lowest extent of Arctic sea ice for November since satellites started keeping records in 1979.
  Global warming is a driving force behind this change. As we pump more carbon into the atmosphere, scientists warn that the Arctic will lose even more ice. In a matter of decades, scientists estimated this year, the Arctic Ocean may become ice-free in the summer.
  The disappearance of Arctic ice is already having a huge impact on the ocean's ecosystem. In November, a team of scientists published a new analysis of satellite data, finding that the ocean has been increasing its production of algae by some 47 percent since 1997. Scientists suspect that the size and timing of this bloom is altering the entire Arctic food web, and they're now gathering data to find out what exactly is happening.
  This study was carried out as part of NASA's Earth Science program, using data largely supplied by NASA's satellites. Shortly after the it was published, reports came out that President-elect Trump's advisers are pushing to shut down NASA's study of our own planet.
  If we let our Earth-monitoring satellites wink out, the planet will not stop changing. The only thing that will change is our own ability to understand the Earth. -- Carl Zimmer

Highlight: The Environmental Protection Agency has been systematically dismantling its website about a problem the president has labeled a “hoax.”


Body


The Trump administration is making it harder to find government information about climate change on the web. If you searched Google for the words “climate change” a little over six months ago, one of the first hits would have been the Environmental Protection Agency’s website.
But that was before April 28, when the agency began systematically dismantling its climate change website, which had survived Democratic and Republican administrations and was a            leading source of information on a global problem that the president, as a candidate, labeled “a hoax.”
If you search those words today, a link to the E.P.A. site may not appear until the second or third search results page, and sometimes not even then, depending on your browser settings. The site has fallen in Google’s search results because its address, or URL, no longer directs you to the climate change site or a related page. If you click that link, you’ll be redirected to a notice page that says, “We are currently updating our website to reflect E.P.A.’s priorities under the leadership” of President Trump and Scott Pruitt, the agency’s administrator. That page, in turn, contains a link to an            archived version of the E.P.A.’s website.
Well, you might think, at least the old site has been preserved. But the archive is far from complete. A significant number of pages and PDFs are not available, and entire portions of the site, like the Student’s Guide to Global Climate Change, have been left out. Some of these pages and PDFs can no longer be found anywhere within the government’s web presence. The E.P.A. climate-related web pages that are still live continue to provide valuable information, but many links from those pages to other pages have been removed. And now-broken links that previously led to the E.P.A. climate change pages are scattered across federal and nonfederal websites.
Since January, our organization, the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative, has monitored changes to tens of thousands of web pages across federal agencies. While we haven’t found examples of altered data, it is clear that the administration is intent on making it difficult or impossible to find information on its web pages about climate change.
Of all the government websites we’ve been monitoring, the E.P.A.’s has been hit hardest. Terms like “greenhouse gases,” “carbon” and “climate change” have been replaced by vague descriptors like “sustainability” and “emissions.” In addition, web resources about specific regulations have disappeared.
One website that has vanished concerned the Clean Power Plan, President Barack Obama’s effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from electric power generation. It was replaced by a single web page containing only information about a presidential order calling for a review of the plan. Months later, the E.P.A. announced that it would seek to repeal the Obama plan. Removing information about the plan’s benefits has made it difficult for citizens            to provide informed comments during the repeal process.
The agency also removed its website for “Climate and Energy Resources for State, Local and Tribal Governments” and replaced it with one called “Energy Resources for State, Local and Tribal Governments,” eliminating over 200 web pages, including almost all of those pertaining to climate change. In a            recent letter to Mr. Pruitt about this overhaul, seven Democratic senators asked for an explanation and demanded that the site be revived, calling its removal “part of a sequence of disturbing E.P.A. actions that appear designed to censor dialogue about climate change.” In particular, the senators argued, the alterations removed information to help local communities protect themselves “from extreme weather events and sea level rise driven by climate change.”
Climate change websites at several other federal agencies have been altered, too. The State Department removed reports containing required emissions projections under international treaty.            The Interior Department removed descriptions of its priorities for tackling climate change and its climate-related coordination efforts. And links to websites hosting climate data were removed from the main Department of Energy            climate change web page. Fortunately, climate websites at NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration appear to have escaped the administration’s meddling and removals. So far.
By altering and removing climate websites built over years and paid for by tax dollars, the Trump administration is actively working to muddy the overwhelming scientific consensus that human activity drives climate change. These actions only generate confusion about the issue and delay progress toward reaching a policy solution supported by the public.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt have made it clear that they want an America that prioritizes unfettered exploitation of fossil fuels, ignores the negative effects of greenhouse gas emissions and undermines global efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change.
A lot more is on the line if the Trump administration proceeds toward this vision and continues its assault on the government’s climate change information: access to scientific data, continuing data-collection efforts, the integrity of the digital infrastructure that stores important information and statistics about the climate and, ultimately, the scientific research programs that help us understand what’s coming next and contribute to the well-being of Americans and people everywhere.

Highlight: Here are some of the voices of those central to environmental policy who have denied the effects of human-caused climate change.


Body


As President Trump prepares to unveil an executive order to dismantle President Barack Obama’s climate change policies, Washington’s policy-making posts are filling with officials who have a record of openly denying the established science of human-caused climate change.
Climate denial starts at the top:
President Trump
Mr. Trump, the ultimate decider, has demonstrated a cavalier approach to the peer-reviewed atmospheric data that makes up the core of climate science. He has called Mr. Obama’s climate change regulations “stupid.” But in other forums, he has denied making some of those statements and shifted his position.
What he has said:
The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012
He said of climate change at a 2015 rally in South Carolina: “A lot of it’s a hoax. It’s a hoax.”
But in an interview with The New York Times shortly after the election, he seemed to moderate: “I have an open mind to it.”
Vice President Mike Pence
Mr. Pence, the president’s influential No. 2, has appeared to question climate science, although his aim was less to question the existence of climate change as to stand up for the coal-fired power plants that provide his home state, Indiana, with most of its electricity.
What he has said:
“It’s just a few years ago, we were talking about global warming, which is — we haven’t seen a lot of warming lately. I remember back in the ’70s when we were talking about the coming ice age. And, look, you know, we have — we’ve had a tough winter. And in the Midwest, we’re — we’re made of hardy stock. We’ve seen these kind of winters before. And we’ll shoulder through them. We’ll leave the scientific debates for the future.”
MSNBC interview, 2014.
In an interview with CNN in September, Mr. Pence, like his boss, modulated that view.
“There’s no question that the activities that take place in this country and in countries around the world have some impact on the environment and some impact on climate. But Donald Trump and I say let’s follow the science, but for heaven’s sakes let’s not go rushing into the kind of restrictions on our economy that are putting Americans out of work and, frankly, are driving jobs out of this country.”
Stephen K. Bannon
Mr. Trump’s influential senior strategist is the former chief executive at Breitbart News, which regularly publishes articles with headlines like “Global Temperatures Plunge. Icy Silence From Climate Alarmists” and “Climate Change: The Greatest-Ever Conspiracy Against the Taxpayer.” Mr. Bannon is said to be pushing Mr. Trump to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris agreement, which committed nearly every country to take action on carbon dioxide pollution.
What he has said:
The national debt is “not a manufactured crisis like global warming or the health care crisis. This is a — this is an existential crisis.”
Fox News, 2010.
Scott Pruitt
The administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will lead the complex legal efforts to dismantle the Obama-era E.P.A. climate change regulations.
What he has said:
“I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there’s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so, no, I would not agree that it’s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.”
Mr. Pruitt on carbon dioxide and the environment on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” March 9.
David Kreutzer
Mr. Kreutzer, a top E.P.A. aide to Mr. Pruitt, spent years at the conservative Heritage Foundation, where he was a vociferous critic of climate science. Mr. Kreutzer is pressing a hard-line stance against climate policies, such as legally challenging court-ordered regulation of carbon dioxide pollution.
What he has said:
On a panel in January about carbon dioxide emissions, fellow panelists suggested that increased carbon dioxide emissions could be beneficial to the planet. The crowd’s laughter prompted Mr. Kreutzer to snap, “You’re laughing because you’re ignorant.”
“A common claim among proponents of action on climate change is that the overwhelming majority of climatologists agree on global warming science. One commonly cited statistic is that 97 percent of climatologists agree on global warming. … The 97 percent statistic is nothing more than a false talking point; no overwhelming consensus exists among climatologists on the magnitude of future warming or on the urgency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
“The State of Climate Science: No Justification for Extreme Policies,” 2016 Heritage Foundation report, with Mr. Kreutzer as lead author.
James Inhofe
The author of a 2012 book, “The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future,” and a senior member of the Senate committees on the environment and armed services, Senator Inhofe is a crucial voice in the debate over climate change. Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt have mined Mr. Inhofe’s former staff members to serve as energy and environment policy advisers.
What he has said:
“The claim that global warming is caused by man-made emissions is simply untrue and not based on sound science.”
Mr. Inhofe, circa 2003.
“Obama has built a culture of radical alarmists, and they’ll be back. You and I and the American people have won a great victory, but the war goes on. Stay vigilant.”
Video address this month to the Heartland Institute, a group devoted to discrediting climate change.
Lamar Smith
Mr. Smith, chairman of the House science committee, has subpoenaed scientists and questioned their work on many topics, but particularly on human-caused climate change.
What he has said:
“Climate change is caused by a combination of factors, including natural cycles, solar variability and human activity. Scientists still disagree about how much each of these factors contributes to overall climate change. What climate alarmists say is sometimes untrue and often exaggerated. We should rely on good science, not science fiction, when we evaluate climate change.”
Op-ed article in USA Today, 2015.
Rick Perry
Mr. Perry, now the secretary of energy, drew attention during his tenure as the governor of Texas and as a presidential candidate in 2012 and 2016 for mocking climate science. But during his Senate confirmation hearing to head an agency that oversees much of the government-funded research into climate change, Mr. Perry reversed those views.
What he has said:
“It’s all one contrived phony mess that is falling apart under its own weight. Al Gore is a prophet all right, a false prophet of a secular carbon cult, and now even moderate Democrats aren’t buying it.”
“Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America From Washington,” a 2010 book written by Mr. Perry.
But at his confirmation hearing in January, Mr. Perry reversed that view:
“I believe the climate is changing. I believe some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by man-made activity. The question is: How do we address it in a thoughtful way that doesn’t compromise economic growth, the affordability of energy or American jobs?”

Taking On Climate Change
By Tatiana Schlossberg 
  Environmentalists Turned Into Voters
  Nathaniel Stinnett
  Founder and executive director of the Environmental Voter Project
  Nathaniel Stinnett rarely talks about the environment; climate change even less.
  For the person who runs the Environmental Voter Project, that may sound surprising. To Mr. Stinnett, it's pretty obvious, even if it's difficult.
  However, convincing people that environmentalism is important or that climate change is happening isn't the point. The point is getting those who consider themselves environmentalists to vote -- nearly 16 million did not in the 2014 midterm elections.
  Mr. Stinnett, 43, realized if he could get environmentalists to vote, then they would show up in polls of likely voters, and so would their priorities -- the environment and climate change. Politicians would have to pay attention to them to get elected, and these issues would come into the national conversation.
  So, with a baby on the way, Mr. Stinnett made the difficult decision to leave a high-paying job at a Boston law firm and take on the cause.
  But how? Most people buy into the idea that voting is good (even if they don't do it) and would be ashamed for their communities to find out they didn't vote.
  Mr. Stinnett said he and his colleagues used social and peer pressure -- much better ''behavioral nudges'' than talking about the environment. A sample mailer from the group: ''Did you know that last time there was a City Council election, 87 percent of your block voted and you didn't?''
  And it's working. Since starting in Massachusetts in 2015, a report by the group shows that it has increased turnout in multiple elections by around 5 percent; in its first attempt in Florida (St. Petersburg's mayoral race), the group added nearly 500 environmentalists to the voter rolls, and it plans to target nearly a million Florida voters in the coming midterm elections.
  For the midterms this year, with an army of 1,500 volunteers across the country, they'll be targeting 2.4 million environmentalists in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Colorado, Florida and Nevada.
  It might seem depressing that so many environmentalists (let alone Americans) don't vote. But Mr. Stinnett sees it as an ''enormous opportunity.''
  ''We have a silent green majority,'' he said. ''We've already won the battle for hearts and minds, and we have this army that could change everything by doing one thing: voting.''
  ______
  Becoming an Activist for Environmental Justice
  Elizabeth Yeampierre
  Executive director of Uprose
  Elizabeth Yeampierre, a native New Yorker of Puerto Rican heritage, did not plan on being an environmental justice activist.
  When she became the leader of Uprose, a Latino community-based organization in Brooklyn, she began by listening to what the community wanted: clean air; more green space; no new power plants in their neighborhood.
  In the process of fighting for these things and others, Ms. Yeampierre found herself at the helm of what has become one of the country's most successful community-based climate and environmental justice groups.
  From Sunset Park, Brooklyn, she quickly made an impact across the city -- advocating for lead paint removal legislation -- and the state -- helping to pass brownfields legislation -- and nationally -- speaking at a climate change rally, which coincided with Pope Francis's visit, on the National Mall in Washington.
  In the process, Ms. Yeampierre, who is descended from African and indigenous people, has helped change what climate activism looks like. She is making a space for young people of color, including at events like the People's Climate March.
  ''There are all these stereotypes about minorities not caring about climate change,'' she said, ''but we live within our carbon footprint, and we do care.''
  Cindy Weisner, the executive director of the Grassroots Global Justice Alliance, met Ms. Yeampierre as they were both helping to organize the People's Climate March, and was immediately impressed by her ability to connect the needs of her community to the wider environmental and climate justice movement.
  ''For her to extend out beyond the needs of her community was a real sign showing me personally: this is what leadership means,'' Ms. Weisner said.
  Ms. Yeampierre, who is in her 50s, said her success was deeply rooted in protest culture and community organizing, not some radical innovation: she listens, she shares.
  And she has perspective: ''Our ancestors were in shackles, and we're a testament to their sacrifice and their vision.
  ''Like them we need to be able to believe we can change things. There has never been a challenge to our survival like climate change,'' but that doesn't mean we give up, she said.
  ''I can't live thinking that I didn't do everything I could.''
  ______
  Finding a Solution for Plastic Pollution
  Boyan Slat
  Founder of The Ocean Cleanup
  Swirling in the eddies and currents of the Northern Pacific Ocean are trillions of pieces of plastic, stretching across an area about four times the size of California. It's a scourge that scientists lament, and one that captures the public imagination every so often, like when a photo of a sea horse wrapped around a Q-tip goes viral.
  The scope of the problem, like so many environmental issues, feels too big to do anything about to most people, including adults.
  Enter Boyan Slat. When he was 16, he went scuba diving in Greece, where he said he saw more plastic than fish. The problem of marine plastic pollution became one he wanted to solve.
  Within two years -- at the same time that he became a legal adult in his native Netherlands -- he had started a foundation, The Ocean Cleanup, and began developing a device to get plastic out of the ocean.
  Now 23, he is getting ready to deploy his invention to the North Pacific Garbage Patch, where this summer it will begin gathering plastic, which will be taken by barge to land where it will be recycled. The hope is that half of the plastic there will be gone within five years.
  Despite his efforts to solve a major environmental problem -- he plans to collect the plastic in the four other accumulation zones in the South Pacific, North and South Atlantic and Indian Oceans -- he considers himself a technologist, not an environmentalist. For Mr. Slat, marine plastic pollution was something he thought he could fix, through his passion for invention and technology.
  ''I hope that the Ocean Cleanup can be a blueprint of how you can solve problems,'' he said. ''Instead of fighting against the stuff you don't agree with, building the future that you do agree with.''
  ______
  Carbon Dioxide Emissions Become Fuels and Materials
  Kendra Kuhl
  Co-founder of Opus 12
  Imagine a future where car engines run on particles gathered from the fuel they've already burned and where plastic doesn't sit in landfills forever, but has another life -- as plastic.
  That's the future dreamed up by Kendra Kuhl and her co-founders of Opus 12, a clean energy start-up that seeks to turn carbon dioxide emissions into new fuels and materials similar to plastic. And they are in the process of creating it.
  Through a complicated process that is hard for a journalist with no background in chemical engineering to explain, carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes are combined with water and a catalyst in a reactor. When (renewably powered) electricity is applied to the reactor, it can produce fuel or plastics.
  Dr. Kuhl and her colleagues are working on creating a commercial-scale prototype, but they hope someday to be able to recycle tons of carbon dioxide emissions every day, preventing additional planet-warming emissions and finding a beneficial use for the gas we have released in such abundance.
  Dr. Kuhl, 36, majored in chemistry as an undergraduate at the University of Montana and later earned her doctorate in the subject at Stanford University. She was drawn to the field partly because of her talent for it and partly because she wanted to do something about climate change, inspired by her love of the outdoors that came from growing up in Montana.
  Ilan Gur, the founding director of Cyclotron Road, a fellowship program that supports scientists trying to build technologies with global impact, selected Dr. Kuhl and her co-founder, Etosha Cave, for their first class of fellows because of their unique application of hard science to the world's biggest challenge.
  ''I'm not one to use hyperbole lightly,'' Mr. Gur said, ''but what she's working on could be part of a solution that potentially saves the planet.''
  Ms. Kuhl is slightly more modest: ''Naïvely when I was in high school, I thought, 'We can make a new technology that can solve this whole problem.' The deeper into it I've gotten the more I've realized that a new technology can help, but it takes all kinds of things together to make a difference.''
  ______
  A Public Defender of Climate Sciences
  Kim Cobb
  Professor of atmospheric and climate sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology
  When Kim Cobb looks at a coral reef, she sees something others might miss: thousands of years of climate history.
  She has been researching on Christmas Island in the Central Pacific for more than two decades, and has been able to reconstruct how El Niño has behaved for the last 7,000 years.
  Because of her work, scientists can say with greater confidence that El Niño has become more intense as a result of human activity.
  And she has seen its effects firsthand. When she visited her research site after the 2015-16 El Niño, she saw a skeleton of the reef. More than 75 percent was dead.
  ''You can't witness what I did at my research site of 20-plus years, watch it die and in the same year watch an administration get elected that is openly hostile to climate change and climate policy and not be changed by those events,'' she said.
  Since then, Dr. Cobb, 43, has become more than an award-winning climate scientist -- she has become a public defender of climate scientists, their work and the planet.
  On Twitter (@coralsncaves), at the March for Science Atlanta last year, and in all her public appearances, she presses for engagement -- demanding that audiences live their values; challenging scientists to focus on solutions, not just on identifying problems; encouraging her students to reduce their carbon footprints.
  Being a mother of four has also made her more radical. Climate change is even more urgent because of them, she said, and her experience ''narrowly escaping'' the professional damage so many mothers endure made her want to advance the careers of other women in climate science and science more generally. She has the opportunity to do that as an Advance professor of diversity, equity and inclusion at Georgia Tech.
  For Dr. Cobb, climate change and diversity in science are connected. They both require engagement and solutions, and plenty of voices and ideas.
  ''The medicine of engagement keeps me going personally in what are deep structural long-term challenges that I know I can't fix alone,'' she said.
  ______
  How We Picked Our Visionaries
  People love lists.
  We want to check out the best places to travel, catch up with the best inventions of the last 100 years, be in the know about the best-dressed people, the best books, the best schools. And on and on.
  Of course, there is a risk to listmaking. Maybe your choices won't hold up over the years. Maybe the best book of decades ago seems not so great today.
  With the listmaking fervor and its risks in mind, we searched for people who would fit our criteria for visionaries. They had to be people who are forward-looking, working on exciting projects, helping others or taking a new direction. We wanted diversity in gender, race and ethnic background.
  We assigned writers who are knowledgeable about the subjects we deemed most important. And we limited the list to 30.
  Narrowing down the numbers was a huge challenge. And that's a good problem to have. It means there are a lot of people out there who are following their visions.
  We hope this inspires you to follow yours.

Up late last night? We were, too, on the climate desk, sorting through America’s mixed bag of election results on climate change.
In the most direct rejection Tuesday of a plan to tame greenhouse gas emissions, voters in Washington state defeated a proposed tax on carbon. The vote was a critical state-level test of whether carbon pricing can win broader support at the national level.
It’s not at all clear, however, that a carbon price is even on the agenda for Democrats, who handily won control of the House of Representatives. Nancy Pelosi, widely expected to become House speaker, has vowed to            revive a select committee on global warming, a panel she initiated the last time Democrats controlled the chamber. But she has been vague about what, if any, legislation Democrats will seek.
Crucially, any House legislation would have to proceed without help from moderate Republicans like Carlos Curbelo of Florida, who lost his seat last night. Rare among Republicans, he championed climate science and introduced a plan of his own to tax carbon emissions.
There will be a new class of House committee leaders taking up environmental issues as they take over from Republican leaders hostile to climate science. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, who is poised to take over the House Science Committee from Lamar Smith, who disputes the scientific consensus on climate change, vowed the issue would be front and center for her.
One of her goals, Ms. Johnson said last night, will be to “address the challenge of climate change, starting with acknowledging it is real.”
Meantime, Democrats have promised hearings on the Trump administration’s regulatory rollbacks at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department, as well as the ethics questions that have dogged Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. 
Next year promises to be a wild ride.
As a parting note: Last night’s elections showed how deeply Americans are divided. But I’d urge you today to take some time with these maps from my colleague Nadja Popovich showing a few places where Americans actually find agreement on energy policy.
One thing you can do: Get involved after the election
The election is over, but your political engagement around climate change doesn’t have to stop.
According to Elizabeth Beaumont, an associate professor of politics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, the postelection period is a good time to reflect on the issues that you’re most concerned about. And, it’s a time to find opportunities to engage with them in your community.
“It can be everything from looking at what a town council, a mayor’s office or what your local school board is doing around certain kinds of issues,” Professor Beaumont said. “And, if you don’t see your issue represented, thinking about how this could be a priority, even if it’s engaging in symbolic politics of getting resolutions passed.”
Getting involved doesn’t have to be about government. It could mean getting a group of parents together at your children’s school and organizing an energy audit.
“Very often,” Professor Beaumont said, civic engagement “is about not necessarily tying it back to partisan politics, which is so much of what our elections are, but tying it to either issues or causes that are very important to people.”
Under this thinking, politics becomes less of a zero-sum game where if one side wins, the other loses. It becomes more about what Professor Beaumont called “the art of the possible.”
“It’s getting into the more issue-based and cause-based politics,” she said. “People sometimes do find more common ground when they’re thinking about working on a cause or an issue than when they’re thinking about red versus blue.”
While we may live in a digital era, it doesn’t replace the face-to-face connections that are often needed to get things done. In fact, if you find that you don’t have much of an in-person community, working to create one might be a place to start.
“If you’re part of a community group or an organization, even if it’s not overtly interested in politics, when an issue or a cause comes up that members of the group are concerned about, they then have a community in a set of relationships and people to kind of talk through and strategize,” Professor Beaumont said.
Here’s one more thing you can do: Submit your writing to this newsletter! We’re asking you, our readers, to contribute to our “One Thing You Can Do” series. Send your full submission, no more than 250 words, to onething@nytimes.com; it could be published here. Deadline: Dec. 1.
... and more than one thing policymakers can do
Climate change can often feel like an overwhelming and unmanageable. Recall that recent report from the United Nations that said the world would have to completely overhaul its energy system in the next 13 years to avoid dangerous warming.
With a message like that, it’s hard to even know where to begin.
So I found it useful to chat with Hal Harvey, head of a think tank called Energy Innovation, which models the impacts of various climate policies. He’s recently published a guidebook for policymakers that lays out a set of concrete actions they could take to avoid big temperature increases.
His main message is that the world needs to prioritize the big stuff. That means leaders in the world’s 20 largest carbon emitters — including the United States, China, India and Europe — should focus on a handful of actions that can get emissions down in a hurry.
“This is a triage business,” he said. “If you took the top 20 countries, focused on about a dozen policies and designed them right, we could make a lot of headway. Otherwise, we’re just flailing.”
The things to focus on: decarbonizing power plants, reducing transportation emissions, making buildings and factories more efficient, curbing pollution from industrial processes like steel and cement, and reducing deforestation in tropical countries.
Here’s the notable part: We basically know how to do most of this. For his book, Mr. Harvey and his team scoured the globe for policies that have already cut emissions in these areas — things like California’s clean-electricity standard or Japan’s energy-efficiency competitions for appliance and vehicle manufacturers. If every country adopted the best policies already in effect today, we could get somewhere.
He cautions, however, that there’s no silver bullet. While some analysts have suggested that a carbon tax could solve much of the climate problem, his modeling indicates that it would provide only about 26 percent of the cuts needed to avoid the worst effects of warming.
Similarly, it’s tempting to hope electric cars will save the day. “But, even under really fast electric vehicle scenarios, the world is still going to build at least two billion more internal combustion engines,” Mr. Harvey said.
Mr. Harvey notes that in the United States and elsewhere, policymakers have nurtured wind and solar power, cleaning up the grid. Yet, they’ve neglected sectors like heavy industry — cement, steel, chemicals — that account for 27 percent of the cuts needed by 2050.
Of course, the hardest part of dealing with climate change is often the politics, as Lisa explained above. But after Tuesday’s elections, for policymakers interested in crafting a climate plan, this guide at least makes it seem a little more tractable.
“Solving this problem does take political will,” Mr. Harvey said. “But it doesn’t take miracles.”

Also this week, how we captured the stark beauty of ghost forests. 
Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. 
Last month, young people around the world skipped school to join global climate strikes. Children of all ages marched, chanted and carried signs with slogans like, “You’ll die of old age, I’ll die of climate change.” 
Dark messages like that highlighted the worry many young people feel about climate change. 
Climate change and related natural disasters can take a toll on mental health, according to a 2017 report by the American Psychological Association. That can include depression and anxiety.
Children may be one of the hardest-hit groups. According to a poll by the Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation, more than seven in 10 teenagers and young adults in the United States say climate change will cause harm to their generation. That includes young people who identify as Democratics and            Republicans.
In order to lighten that anxiety, experts say, parents should talk to their children.
To address these fears, find a calm moment to ask your child what they’ve seen or heard about climate change and how that makes them feel, said Dr. Lise Van Susteren, a psychiatrist in Washington and a founder of the Climate Psychiatry Alliance. She said parents should gently correct irrational fears but not downplay anxieties just to make children feel better. That could just make the child feel she can’t trust adults to be honest with them on this topic.
“Talk about the problem, then pivot to the solution,” Dr. Van Susteren said. 
Once you’ve discussed your child’s climate fears, talk about people and organizations that are already working on large-scale climate solutions, said Maria Ojala, a psychologist at Orebro University in Sweden who studies young people and climate change. 
If possible, talk about solutions in a personal context. Highlight steps you’ve already taken as a family or as individuals to reduce your carbon footprints and brainstorm new ideas together. Taking action can be an empowering antidote to fear, Dr. Van Susteren said. Encourage your child to take action with her peers as well, like joining a group at school or volunteering with a local organization. Collective action has mental health benefits, according to Dr. Ojala. “We are social beings and it’s very good for our well-being to work together with others and be part of a group,” she said.
You probably won’t get rid of your child’s fears altogether, and that’s O.K., Dr. Ojala said. The goal is to help your child cope with her fears in a constructive way to avoid hopelessness. 
Finally, think about your own personal choices and lead by example, Dr. Van Susteren said. Your children are probably watching.
The story behind the salt prints in our ghost forests story
Hello! I’m the art director for the NYT climate team, so you probably won’t have seen my name here before. It’s mostly a behind-the-scenes job. But, we thought you’d be interested in the back story on the piece about ghost forests we published this week — not only because the topic is important, but also because the presentation was unusual.
The gist of the story, reported by Moises Velasquez-Manoff and photographed by Gabriella Demczuk, is that rising seas are creating huge stands of dead trees, sometimes surprisingly far from the sea. It’s happening in lots of places, but we focused on the Eastern Seaboard.
We’ve used drones, wide lenses and other digital flourishes to cover forests in the past — like in our story last year on cedar trees dying in Lebanon. This time we thought we’d do something different and get close to the roots of these things dying en masse.
Gabriella and Moises trekked out to the sites in the thick of a July heat wave, trudging through thick mud and marsh to find these ghost forests. “Sweating under a black sheet,” she said, “I photographed the trees using a 4x5 large format camera to capture the subtle hues and exquisite details that only film can produce.”
And, because she was photographing with film, we brainstormed ways to experiment with printmaking. She had the idea to collect salt water from each location and use it as a wash to sensitize photo paper to make salt prints. It’s a very early photo technique from the 19th-century that gives a sort of sepia tone to the final product.
In Gabriella’s words: “I welcomed discoloration, fog and irregularities that came with using different concentrations of salt levels in the water to create a visual metaphor for how salt is slowly killing these coastal forests, stripping the bark and bleaching its colors.”
Maybe you loved it, maybe you hated it. But we hope that it’s something you haven’t seen before, and something that sticks with you. As always, let us know what you think of the story.

HONG KONG -- When industrialized nations pledged in 2009 to mobilize $100 billion a year by 2020 to help the poorest countries deal with climate change, it won over some skeptics in the developing world who had argued that rich nations should pay up for contributing so much to the problem.
But the money has been slow to materialize, with only $3.5 billion actually committed out of $10.3 billion pledged to a prominent United Nations program called the Green Climate Fund. President Trump's decision last year to cancel $2 billion in promised aid did not help. 
  At a climate change conference in Thailand this past week, some delegates reached by telephone said that the setting -- the heart of Southeast Asia, a region where challenges relating to warming are readily apparent -- was grimly fitting. They described the United Nations program's shortcomings as a symbol of a broken promise.
  ''The fund of hope is becoming a fund of hopelessness,'' said Meena Raman, legal adviser to the Third World Network, an advocacy group in Malaysia, and a former nonvoting member of the Green Climate Fund's board.
  The meeting in Bangkok of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is a prelude to a larger one in December in Poland, where countries will try to set rules for carrying out the 2015 Paris climate accord.
  The Bangkok meeting did not specifically address financing to mitigate climate change. But it came two months after disagreements among the Green Climate Fund's board members prevented the fund from approving new projects at a routine meeting.
  Some observers say the fund's funding shortfall and bureaucratic malaise have dimmed expectations for the talks in Poland, which were already bound to be difficult.
  ''The lack of real money coming through is really undermining trust in the negotiations'' around how to put the Paris accord in place, said Brandon Wu, the director of policy and campaigns at ActionAid USA, an advocacy group that monitored the Bangkok meeting. ''That's a big part of the logjam.''
  The Green Climate Fund was designed to help developing countries prepare for climate disasters and develop low-fossil-fuel economies. It was part of a larger plan, led by Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state in 2009, to put together $100 billion a year for poor economies through a combination of government contributions and private investments.
  Many academics see contributions to the fund by wealthy countries as a moral imperative, arguing that the developing world is most vulnerable to the effects of climate change but least responsible for causing them.
  ''Certainly, the richer countries should bear more of the burden in the G.C.F. because they have more means and more at stake,'' said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, referring to the fund by its initials. ''Richer countries also have benefited from wealth accumulated over decades when climate issues were not at the forefront.''
  The Obama administration delivered $1 billion of a $3 billion pledge to the program. But last year, Mr. Trump, while announcing plans to exit the Paris accord, said the United States would no longer pay into the Green Climate Fund. He explained his decision by saying that the contributions could eventually cost the United States ''billions and billions and billions'' of dollars.
  Ms. Raman said that while she still hoped to see other developed nations ''step up'' by contributing more to the fund, they had not yet made their exact commitments clear.
  ''We're very horrified by the stance taken by the United States, but it's not the only one,'' she said. ''All the developed countries are united around the United States in not making any progress on finance.''
  World leaders vowed in Paris to avoid a warming of 2 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), a threshold that they deemed unacceptably risky. Yet there are widely varying estimates of how much money is being spent on fighting climate change in poor economies. One reason for the discrepancy is that there is no consensus over which contributions should be counted in the tally.
  And critics of the Green Climate Fund have questioned why much of the money it is distributing has been channeled through large development banks, or private-sector enterprises led by global investment firms. They argue that more climate aid should go directly to governments in the developing world, or the communities at risk.
  ''We want money, but we're hard-pressed to give our full blessing to the projects coming on board,'' said Lidy Nacpil, the coordinator of the Asian Peoples' Movement on Debt and Development, a regional alliance of nonprofits and community groups.
  But even critics of the fund worry about the shortfall, saying it poses risks for people in poor regions where governments are either unable or unwilling to spend more on climate mitigation and adaptation.
  The initial, Obama-era goal of securing $100 billion in climate finance and investment per year by 2020 ''was the amount needed by the countries to implement their ambitions,'' said Neha Rai, an expert on climate finance at the International Institute for Environment and Development, a think tank in Britain. ''But at the same time, irrespective of the amount, it gives a policy signal that climate-relevant investments are important.''
  Southeast Asia is a case in point.
  People who live in the Asia-Pacific region are ''particularly vulnerable'' to the effects of a changing climate, the Asian Development Bank said last year in a report, which projected Southeast Asia to be ''most affected by heat extremes'' in the wider area by the end of the century.
  Of 74 approved Green Climate Fund projects worth $3.5 billion, three are in Southeast Asia and they have a combined value of nearly $156 million, according to data provided by the program. Nineteen others in the program's pipeline directly target the region and are worth $904 million.
  Ms. Nacpil said climate finance was important in Southeast Asia partly because so many cities are in coastal areas that are vulnerable to sea-level rise and must adapt. And because the number of coal-fired power plants in the region is expected to increase, she added, governments should be encouraged to bend national policies toward investments in renewable energy.
  Jenty Kirsch-Wood, a climate specialist with the United Nations Development Program, defended the Green Climate Fund by pointing to its benefits in Vietnam, where part of a $30 million grant from the program has funded the distribution of free, storm-resistant housing to people in typhoon-prone coastal areas.
  ''The Green Climate Fund has revitalized hope for countries like Vietnam that they can meet their Paris agreement targets -- embracing the green energy revolution, but also helping their citizens to adapt to climate change,'' Ms. Kirsch-Wood said.
  But $30 million goes only so far in a country of 93 million people with an economy worth more than $200 billion and a long, exposed coastline. And in a 2015 climate plan submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention, Vietnam said that state investments could provide only 30 percent of what it needs to adapt.
  ''Many developing countries have made clear that they will not be able to reach their Paris agreement targets without international climate finance,'' said Oyun Sanjaasuren, the Green Climate Fund's director of external affairs.
  ''For its part, G.C.F.'s pipeline of climate projects in developing countries shows that demand for climate finance already exceeds supply,'' she said.

PORTLAND, Ore. — The final meeting of the year for the Pacific Islander Club at Roosevelt High School was mostly celebratory, with candy leis for the departing seniors and a spread of fried chicken. But the club was talking climate change, and for many students in North Portland, Ore., the subject hit close to home.
Akash Sharma, 17, spoke of visiting his family in Fiji, where a Category 5 cyclone killed several people and destroyed entire communities in 2016.
“My grandparents’ house flew away and all my family’s house was gone,” he said. “It was just a tough time.”
Climate change and its effects, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, have been a major focus for Akash’s club. Its members were either born in or trace their roots to places like Fiji; the Marshall Islands; Micronesia; Okinawa, Japan; or Samoa — places, they fear, that may not exist in a few decades because of rising sea levels and other consequences of global warming.
For too many people, climate change is “about health and recycling,” said Pone Aisea, 18, whose family is from Tonga. “For us, it’s about our islands sinking. Our culture — all of it — would go away.”
The students’ sense of urgency compelled them to approach Portland’s school board several years ago, in hopes of making climate justice — the framing of environmental crises as a human rights issue — a staple of every student’s education. They seemed to get their wish in 2016, when the board unanimously passed a resolution that called for the integration of climate change and climate justice into the curriculum at all district schools.
More than three years later, students and teachers said, that has yet to happen. Hundreds of students across the city walked out of their classes in March, saying that Portland Public Schools had done little to carry out the resolution. Some students have even taken up the effort themselves; Roosevelt High’s first climate youth summit this past spring was organized by the Pacific Islander Club.
Just one public high school in the city, Lincoln High, currently offers a stand-alone course dedicated to environmental justice. In a letter to the school superintendent, Tim Swinehart, a teacher at Lincoln, said he had been told by the district last year that “‘peripheral’ work like climate justice education would need to be put on hold.”
School officials have conceded that they took their time with the resolution, and after repeated student protests, they agreed late last month to set aside money for a districtwide rollout.
Given the city’s hyper-progressive image, the fact that officials had until recently dragged their feet on an issue like climate change might come as a surprise. This is a city that is trying to map every one of its trees, and one where a district court is hearing a lawsuit on whether            young people have a constitutional right to be protected from global warming.
But the delays illustrate how challenging it can be for cities and schools to incorporate climate change issues into curriculums, even when polls show that most students and parents are clamoring for them.
Many states have pledged to adhere to a set of guidelines released in 2013 called the Next Generation Science Standards, which included for the first time a recommendation that climate change be taught to students as early as in middle school. Actually getting climate change into schools, though, has faced many obstacles, including            poorly trained teachers, staunch opponents (who are sometimes            sitting in the classroom), and political logjams.
“In this country, education is not national,” said Frank Niepold, the climate education coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. “There are 15,000 school districts in this country. You might have one district in a state that says they’re not touching these standards. And then we have states that aren’t doing these new standards, but some of their districts are. It is a very organic landscape.”
Mr. Niepold warned against forcing schools or districts to make promises they could not keep. “Change takes time,” he said. “When you move too fast, it doesn’t really work.”
But in Portland, patience wore thin.
“The very best climate scientists in the world tell us that we have 11 years to fundamentally transform all aspects of society to adequately address our current climate emergency,” Mr. Swinehart, the Lincoln High teacher, said in his letter to the superintendent. “Our students are being denied the climate-justice curriculum they deserve.”
[Not all students are on board with climate change education.]
The superintendent, Guadalupe Guerrero, met with student activists early last month. He committed to carrying out the resolution, which passed the year before he took office in 2017, and acknowledged that there had been “a disconnect” and “that the student voice has not been placed in the center.”
Weeks later, the students scored a crucial victory: On May 28, the school board allocated $200,000 to climate-justice education for the coming school year. The money would be used to hire a full-time coordinator, further integrate climate justice units into social studies and science curriculums and establish a separate course in each high school. (Previously, Mr. Swinehart said, only about $35,000 per year had been allocated since the resolution passed.)
When asked in an interview why the district had taken as long as it did, Mr. Guerrero said, “I can’t speak to why a prior administration didn’t move on this resolution.” But he was optimistic, and a school board official said they expected the separate course offering to be in all high schools in the 2020-21 school year.
“Hopefully, a year from now,” Mr. Guerrero said, “we’ll be able to celebrate a lot of the great climate-justice work we’ve done in Portland.”
If the rollout is successful, Portland Public Schools will have what is likely to be the most extensive dedicated climate-justice curriculum in the country.
This work has already been underway at Lincoln High. Mr. Swinehart began teaching his environmental justice course in 2016, and also teaches a geography class where climate-related subject matter has been fully integrated. One of the priorities in the school board’s resolution was to focus not just on global warming but on people from “front-line” communities — the first and hardest hit by its effects.
“With natural disasters, communities of color will be hit the hardest,” said Sriya Chinnam, 17, one of Mr. Swinehart’s geography students, on a recent morning. “Because they’ll be in places where they don’t have the type of infrastructure to help them rebuild their homes and help them adapt.”
Students at Roosevelt High in North Portland, one of the more diverse parts of a city that is more than 70 percent white, know all too well how high the stakes are.
Kaiya Yonamine, a 17-year-old junior at Roosevelt, traveled to Okinawa to film a documentary, “Our Island’s Treasure,” about a planned United States Marine Corps base that many fear will threaten endangered sea species and coral reefs. She interviewed residents — some in their nineties — who have organized protests to block construction of the project.
“It’s a really emotional thing for the Islander community,” Kaiya said.
Akash, the student whose relatives lost their home to a cyclone in Fiji, said he wished some of his friends felt the same urgency about climate change that he did. “If where they’re from was disappearing,” he said, “they’d be pretty bummed out too.”

But he was optimistic, and a school board official said they expected the separate course offering to be in all high schools in the 2020-21 school year.
  ''Hopefully, a year from now,'' Mr. Guerrero said, ''we'll be able to celebrate a lot of the great climate-justice work we've done in Portland.''
  If the rollout is successful, Portland Public Schools will have what is likely to be the most extensive dedicated climate-justice curriculum in the country.
  This work has already been underway at Lincoln High. Mr. Swinehart began teaching his environmental justice course in 2016, and also teaches a geography class where climate-related subject matter has been fully integrated. One of the priorities in the school board's resolution was to focus not just on global warming but on people from ''front-line'' communities -- the first and hardest hit by its effects.
  ''With natural disasters, communities of color will be hit the hardest,'' said Sriya Chinnam, 17, one of Mr. Swinehart's geography students, on a recent morning. ''Because they'll be in places where they don't have the type of infrastructure to help them rebuild their homes and help them adapt.''
  Students at Roosevelt High in North Portland, one of the more diverse parts of a city that is more than 70 percent white, know all too well how high the stakes are.
  Kaiya Yonamine, a 17-year-old junior at Roosevelt, traveled to Okinawa to film a documentary, ''Our Island's Treasure,'' about a planned United States Marine Corps base that many fear will threaten endangered sea species and coral reefs. She interviewed residents -- some in their nineties -- who have organized protests to block construction of the project.
  ''It's a really emotional thing for the Islander community,'' Kaiya said.
  Akash, the student whose relatives lost their home to a cyclone in Fiji, said he wished some of his friends felt the same urgency about climate change that he did. ''If where they're from was disappearing,'' he said, ''they'd be pretty bummed out too.''

The world’s land and water resources are being exploited at “unprecedented rates,” a new United Nations report warns, which combined with climate change is putting dire pressure on the ability of humanity to feed itself.
The report, prepared by more than 100 experts from 52 countries and released in summary form in Geneva on Thursday, found that the window to address the threat is closing rapidly. A half-billion people already live in places turning into desert, and soil is being lost between 10 and 100 times faster than it is forming, according to the report. 
Climate change will make those threats even worse, as floods, drought, storms and other types of extreme weather threaten to disrupt, and over time shrink, the global food supply. Already, more than 10 percent of the world’s population remains undernourished, and some authors of the report warned in interviews that food shortages could lead to an increase in cross-border migration.
A particular danger is that food crises could develop on several continents at once, said Cynthia Rosenzweig, a senior research scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies and one of the lead authors of the report. “The potential risk of multi-breadbasket failure is increasing,” she said. “All of these things are happening at the same time.”
The report also offered a measure of hope, laying out pathways to addressing the looming food crisis, though they would require a major re-evaluation of land use and agriculture worldwide as well as consumer behavior. Proposals include increasing the productivity of land, wasting less food and persuading more people to shift their diets away from cattle and other types of meat. 
“One of the important findings of our work is that there are a lot of actions that we can take now. They’re available to us,” Dr. McElwee said. “What some of these solutions do require is attention, financial support, enabling environments.” 
The summary was released Thursday by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international group of scientists convened by the United Nations that pulls together a wide range of existing research to help governments understand climate change and make policy decisions. The I.P.C.C. is writing a series of climate reports, including one last year on the disastrous consequences if the planet’s temperature rises just 1.5 degrees Celsius above its preindustrial levels, as well as an            upcoming report on the state of the world’s oceans.
Some authors also suggested that food shortages are likely to affect poorer parts of the world far more than richer ones. That could increase a flow of immigration that is already redefining politics in North America, Europe and other parts of the world. 
“People’s lives will be affected by a massive pressure for migration,” said Pete Smith, a professor of plant and soil science at the University of Aberdeen and one of the report’s lead authors. “People don’t stay and die where they are. People migrate.”
Between 2010 and 2015 the number of migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras showing up at the United States’ border with Mexico increased fivefold, coinciding with a dry period that left many with not enough food and was so unusual that scientists suggested it bears the signal of climate change. 
Barring action on a sweeping scale, the report said, climate change will accelerate the danger of severe food shortages. As a warming atmosphere intensifies the world’s droughts, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and other weather patterns, it is speeding up the rate of soil loss and land degradation, the report concludes. 
Higher concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere — a greenhouse gas put there mainly by the burning of fossil fuels — will also reduce food’s nutritional quality, even as rising temperatures cut crop yields and harm livestock. 
Those changes threaten to exceed the ability of the agriculture industry to adapt. 
In some cases, the report says, a changing climate is boosting food production because, for example, warmer temperatures will mean greater yields of some crops at higher latitudes. But on the whole, the report finds that climate change is already hurting the availability of food because of decreased yields and lost land from erosion, desertification and rising seas, among other things. 
Overall if emissions of greenhouse gases continue to rise, so will food costs, according to the report, affecting people around the world. 
“You’re sort of reaching a breaking point with land itself and its ability to grow food and sustain us,” said Aditi Sen, a senior policy adviser on climate change at Oxfam America, an antipoverty advocacy organization.
In addition, the researchers said, even as climate change makes agriculture more difficult, agriculture itself is also exacerbating climate change. 
The report said that activities such as draining wetlands — as has happened in Indonesia and Malaysia to create palm oil plantations, for example — is particularly damaging. When drained, peatlands, which store between 530 and 694 billion tons of carbon dioxide globally, release that carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas, trapping the sun’s heat and warming the planet. Every 2.5 acres of peatlands release the carbon dioxide equivalent of burning 6,000 gallons of gasoline. 
And the emission of carbon dioxide continues long after the peatlands are drained. Of the five gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions that are released each year from deforestation and other land-use changes, “One gigaton comes from the ongoing degradation of peatlands that are already drained,” said Tim Searchinger, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank, who is familiar with the report. (By comparison, the fossil fuel industry emitted about 37 gigatons of carbon dioxide last year, according to the institute.)
Similarly, cattle are significant producers of methane, another powerful greenhouse gas, and an increase in global demand for beef and other meats has fueled their numbers and increased deforestation in critical forest systems like the Amazon. 
Since 1961 methane emissions from ruminant livestock, which includes cows as well as sheep, buffalo and goats, have significantly increased, according to the report. And each year, the amount of forested land that is cleared — much of that propelled by demand for pasture land for cattle — releases the emissions equivalent of driving 600 million cars. 
Overall, the report says there is still time to address the threats by making the food system more efficient. The authors urge changes in how food is produced and distributed, including better soil management, crop diversification and fewer restrictions on trade. They also call for shifts in consumer behavior, noting that at least one-quarter of all food worldwide is wasted. 
But protecting the food supply and cutting greenhouse emissions can also come into conflict with each other, forcing hard choices. 
For instance, the widespread use of strategies such as bioenergy — like growing corn to produce ethanol — could lead to the creation of new deserts or other land degradation, the authors said. The same is true for planting large numbers of trees (something often cited as a powerful strategy to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere), which can push crops and livestock onto less productive land.
Planting as many trees as possible would reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by about nine gigatons each year, according to Pamela McElwee, a professor of human ecology at Rutgers University and one of the report’s lead authors. But it would also increase food prices as much as 80 percent by 2050.
“We cannot plant trees to get ourselves out of the problem that we’re in,” Dr. McElwee said. “The trade-offs that would keep us below 1.5 degrees, we’re not talking about them. We’re not ready to confront them yet.” 
Preventing global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius is likely to require both the widespread planting of trees as well as “substantial” bioenergy to help reduce the use of fossil fuels, the report finds. And if temperatures increase more than that, the pressure on food production will increase as well, creating a vicious circle. 
“Above 2 degrees of global warming there could be an increase of 100 million or more of the population at risk of hunger,” Edouard Davin, a researcher at ETH Zurich and an author of the report, said by email. “We need to act quickly.”
The report also calls for institutional changes, including better access to credit for farmers in developing countries and stronger property rights. And for the first time, the I.P.C.C. cited indigenous people and their knowledge of land stewardship as resources to be tapped. “Agricultural practices that include indigenous and local knowledge can contribute to overcoming the combined challenges of climate change, food security, biodiversity conservation, and combating desertification and land degradation,” the report’s authors wrote.
It comes at a time when indigenous people are currently under threat. According to a report released this year by the nonprofit organization Global Witness, which looks at the links between conflicts and environmental resources, an average of three people were killed per week defending their land in 2018, with more than half of them killed in Latin America.
Overall, the report said that the longer policymakers wait, the harder it will be to prevent a global crisis. “Acting now may avert or reduce risks and losses, and generate benefits to society,” the authors wrote. Waiting to cut emissions, on the other hand, risks “irreversible loss in land ecosystem functions and services required for food, health, habitable settlements and production.”

Trump Lays Plans to Reverse Obama’s Climate Change Legacy

Highlight: The White House is preparing to dismantle major policy actions of the Obama era, including a plan to close hundreds of heavily polluting power plants.

WASHINGTON — President Trump is poised in the coming days to announce his plans to dismantle the centerpiece of President Barack Obama’s            climate change legacy, while also gutting several smaller but significant policies aimed at curbing global warming.
The moves are intended to send an unmistakable signal to the nation and the world that Mr. Trump intends to follow through on his campaign vows to rip apart every element of what the president has called Mr. Obama’s “stupid” policies to address climate change. The timing and exact form of the announcement remain unsettled, however.
The executive actions will follow the White House’s release last week of a proposed budget that would eliminate climate change research and prevention programs across the federal government and slash the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget by 31 percent,            more than any other agency. Mr. Trump also            announced last week that he had ordered Scott Pruitt, the            E.P.A. administrator, to revise the agency’s stringent standards on planet-warming tailpipe pollution from vehicles, another of Mr. Obama’s key climate change policies.
While the White House is not expected to explicitly say the United States is withdrawing from the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, and people familiar with the White House deliberations say Mr. Trump has not decided whether to do so, the policy reversals would make it virtually impossible to meet the emissions reduction goals set by the Obama administration under the international agreement.
In an announcement that could come as soon as Thursday or as late as next month, according to people familiar with the White House’s planning, Mr. Trump will order Mr. Pruitt to withdraw and rewrite a set of Obama-era regulations known as the Clean Power Plan, according to a draft document obtained by The New York Times. The Obama rule was devised to shut down hundreds of heavily polluting coal-fired power plants and freeze construction of new coal plants, while replacing them with vast wind and solar farms.
The draft also lays out options for legally blocking or weakening about a half-dozen additional Obama-era executive orders and policies on climate change.
At a campaign-style rally on Monday in the coal-mining state of Kentucky, Mr. Trump told a cheering audience that he is preparing an executive action that would “save our wonderful coal miners from continuing to be put out of work.”
Experts in environmental law say it will not be possible for Mr. Trump to quickly or simply roll back the most substantive elements of Mr. Obama’s climate change regulations, noting that the process presents a steep legal challenge that could take many years and is likely to end up before the Supreme Court. Economists are skeptical that a rollback of the rules would restore lost coal jobs because the demand for coal has been steadily shrinking for years.
Scientists and climate policy advocates around the world say they are watching the administration’s global warming actions and statements with deep worry. Many reacted with deep concern to Mr. Pruitt’s remarks           this month that he did not believe carbon dioxide was a primary driver of climate change, a statement at odds with the global scientific consensus. They also noted the remarks last week by Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, in            justifying Mr. Trump’s proposed cuts to climate change research programs.
“As to climate change, I think the president was fairly straightforward: We’re not spending money on that anymore,” Mr. Mulvaney said at a White House briefing.
“The message they are sending to the rest of the world is that they don’t believe climate change is serious. It’s shocking to see such a degree of ignorance from the United States,” said Mario J. Molina, a            Nobel Prize-winning scientist from Mexico who advises nations on climate change policy.
The policy reversals also signal that Mr. Trump has no intention of following through on Mr. Obama’s formal pledges under the Paris accord, under which nearly every country in the world submitted plans detailing actions to limit global warming over the coming decade.
Under the accord as it stands, the United States has pledged to reduce its greenhouse pollution about 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. That can be achieved only if the United States not only implements the Clean Power Plan and tailpipe-pollution rules, but also tightens them or adds more policies in future years.
“The message clearly is, ‘We won’t do what the United States has promised to do,’” Mr. Molina said.
In addition to directing Mr. Pruitt to withdraw the Clean Power Plan, the draft order instructs Attorney General Jeff Sessions to request that a federal court halt consideration of a 28-state lawsuit against the regulation. The case was argued before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in September, and the court is expected to release a decision in the coming months on whether to uphold or strike down the rule.
According to the draft, Mr. Trump is also expected to announce that he will lift a moratorium on new coal mining leases on public lands that had been announced last year by the Obama administration.
He is also expected to order White House economists to revisit an Obama-era budgeting metric known as the social cost of carbon. Economists and policy makers used the metric to place a dollar cost on the economic impact of planet-warming carbon dioxide pollution: about $36 per ton. That measure formed the Obama administration’s economic justification for issuing climate change regulations that would harm some industries, such as coal mining, noting that those costs would be outweighed by the economic benefits of preventing billions of tons of planet-warming pollution.
Eliminating or lowering the social cost of carbon could provide the Trump administration the economic justification for putting forth less-stringent regulations.
The draft order would also rescind an executive order by Mr. Obama that all federal agencies take climate change into account when considering any form of environmental permitting.
Unlike the rollback of the power plant and vehicle regulations, which could take years and will be subject to legal challenges, Mr. Trump can make the changes to the coal mining ban and undo Mr. Obama’s executive orders with the stroke of a pen.
White House staff members and energy lobbyists who work closely with them say they have been expecting Mr. Trump to make the climate change announcements for weeks, ever since Mr. Pruitt was confirmed to head the E.P.A. on Feb.           17, but the announcement has been repeatedly rescheduled. The delays of the one-page announcement have largely been a result of disorganization and a chaotic policy and planning process, said people familiar with that process who asked to speak anonymously to avoid angering Mr. Trump.
One reason for the confusion, these people said, is internal disputes about the challenging legal process required to dismantle the Clean Power Plan. While Mr. Trump may announce with great fanfare his intent to roll back the regulations, the legal steps required to fulfill that announcement are lengthy and the outcome uncertain.
“Trump’s announcements have zero impact,” said Richard           J.           Lazarus, a professor of environmental law at Harvard. “They don’t change existing law at all.”
Much of that task will now fall to Mr. Pruitt.
“To undo the rule, the E.P.A. will now have to follow the same procedure that was followed to put the regulations in place,” said Mr. Lazarus, pointing to a multiyear process of proposing draft rules, gathering public comment and forming a legal defense against an expected barrage of lawsuits almost certain to end up before the Supreme Court.

Tuesday: Climate change is remapping the world of wine. Here’s how that’s playing out in California. Also: Dating on college campuses.
Good morning.
(If you don’t already get California Today delivered to your inbox, here’s the sign-up.)
In recent weeks, the Kincade fire ravaged a part of California that has been hit repeatedly by devastating blazes: Wine Country. It’s just one more way the wine industry has been forced to grapple with climate change.
My colleague Eric Asimov, who writes about wine for The Times, recently published            a four-part series on how the wine world is adapting. I asked him to write about how the series came about: 
Despite the best efforts of this country to ignore the changing climate, its effects have arrived quicker and with more extreme consequences than many had imagined.
Few agricultural products are as sensitive as wine grapes to climate. Wine is cherished for its capability of expressing the nuances each year of the vintage weather conditions, as well as the character of the site in which the grapes are grown. But those prized attributes have made climate change a particular challenge for wine growers.
[Here’s the first part of the series: How climate change is redrawing the wine map.]
Since I first wrote in 2003 about how climate change was affecting wine, I’ve been keeping watch and talking about it to growers and producers around the world. In recent years, between intense heat, fires, drought, floods, frosts and power shutdowns, I don’t think any wine region has been as challenged by climate change as Northern California.
In the last month, I’ve written a four-part series on wine and climate change. It began with an overview, followed with a piece examining agricultural practices and then an article on how one large wine producer in Spain has become both a leader in the wine industry’s fight against climate change and in adapting to changing conditions. The final piece focused on how one region, Napa Valley, was responding to climate change.
I chose Napa for two reasons: It’s the best-known American wine region, and because I have spent a lot of time there discussing climate change over the last few years with some incredibly thoughtful people.
[Read the full story about how Napa Valley winemakers are fighting climate change.]
Every step of wine production can expel greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, from the agricultural methods used to tend the vineyard, to how grapes are fermented, how wine is stored and aged, how bottles are manufactured, how wine is shipped and how it’s sold.
“I got a note from United Airlines congratulating me for having traveled a million miles,” John Williams, proprietor of Frog’s Leap Winery in Rutherford, said. “I thought, forget about the farming, maybe I should stop going to New York City to sell wines.”
Yet while Napa Valley is full of people who recognize the existential threat of climate change, the willingness to do something about it is less apparent. Changing successful methods can be risky. And it’s hard enough making wine this year, much less worrying about a vintage 20 years away.
“We’re not seeing the future because we’re caught up in day-to-day operations,” said Dan Petroski, winemaker at Larkmead in Calistoga. “I just think that people think it’s somebody else’s problem.”
[Read about how winemakers in Oregon are battling to save the soil.]
It’s hard not to feel overwhelmed by the scale of the problem. Napa is full of vineyard workers, hotel and restaurant employees, and others who can’t afford to live in the community in which they work. They drive long distances to get there. It’s a problem that can’t be solved at the winery level, and income disparity is not restricted to Napa Valley. These sorts of systemic issues require policy decisions at the highest levels of government.
Is Napa a sustainable fine-wine area in the long term? Some people have suggested that the future of American wine production is at much higher elevations. But the cultural loss would be incalculable.
“It’s not just a question of temperatures,” Mr. Williams said. “It’s soil and history and tradition. We can’t give up on this idea of terroir and how wine speaks to us as a people.”

A record number of Americans understand that climate change is real, according to a new survey, and they are increasingly worried about its effects in their lives today. 
  Some 73 percent of Americans polled late last year said that global warming was happening, the report found, a jump of 10 percentage points from 2015 and three points since last March.
  The rise in the number of Americans who say global warming is personally important to them was even sharper, jumping nine percentage points since March to 72 percent, another record over the past decade.
  The survey is the latest in a series from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication. It was conducted online in November and December by Ipsos, which polled 1,114 American adults.
  The results suggest that climate change has moved out of the realm of the hypothetical for a wide majority of Americans, said Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale program.
  ''It is something that is activating an emotion in people, and that emotion is worry,'' he said. The survey found that 69 percent of Americans were ''worried'' about warming, an eight-point increase since March.
  ''People are beginning to understand that climate change is here in the United States, here in my state, in my community, affecting the people and places I care about, and now,'' Dr. Leiserowitz said. ''This isn't happening in 50 years, 100 years from now.''
  Asked whether people in the United States were being harmed by global warming ''right now,'' 48 percent of the respondents agreed, an increase of nine percentage points since March. And 49 percent said they believed they would be personally harmed by global warming, a seven-point jump over the same period.
  While public opinion on climate issues has fluctuated over the years, many of the recent changes were large enough to fall outside the margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. ''I've never seen jumps in some of the key indicators like this,'' Dr. Leiserowitz said.
  Americans' growing understanding of global warming is part of a long-term trend, he said. But he attributed the recent increases to a number of extreme weather events with plausible connections to a warming planet, and to the publicity that surrounded two major scientific reports on climate change last year.
  Those reports, from the United Nations' scientific panel on climate change and the United States government, laid out grim prospects for the future if action is not taken to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that warm the planet.
  The changes in public opinion over the last year were also tied to politics, Dr. Leiserowitz said, and to the efforts of President Trump to deny the scientific evidence of climate change.
  ''Every time he talks about climate change he drives more media attention to the exact issue,'' Dr. Leiserowitz said.
  Political party affiliation is strongly associated with acceptance of the overwhelming scientific consensus on global warming, with Democrats tending to accept it and Republicans tending to reject it. But Mr. Trump's approach to politics is so divisive, Dr. Leiserowitz said, that when he takes a strong stand on climate change and other issues, ''he tends to drive a majority of the country in the opposite direction.''
  In the poll, a record 62 percent of respondents understood that humans are the main cause of climate change, a four-point rise since March; those attributing it mostly to natural causes were at a record-low 23 percent, a drop of five points over the same period.
  About two-thirds of those surveyed believed global warming was affecting weather in the United States, with about half saying that warming made last year's wildfires in the West and Hurricanes Florence and Michael worse. The realm of attribution science -- which studies how climate change influences individual weather events -- is still evolving, but it has been well established that warming can make wildfires more frequent and hurricanes more destructive.
  Disasters like these have brought once-abstract concepts home, said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University who was not involved in the survey. ''Today, nearly everyone can point to a way that they are personally witnessing and are being personally affected by the impacts of a changing climate in the places where they live,'' she said.
  Global warming and its effects are increasingly part of the national discussion, said Sunshine Menezes, an expert in climate communication at the University of Rhode Island and executive director of the Metcalf Institute for Marine and Environmental Reporting.
  She noted that 41 percent of respondents in the poll said they talked about global warming with family and friends ''often'' or ''occasionally,'' and 56 percent said they heard about the topic in the news media at least once a month, a 13 percent increase since 2015. ''It's becoming harder and harder to avoid conversations about climate change,'' she said.
  Though it is impossible to attribute shifts in public opinion like this to any one factor, Dr. Menezes said, ''I'm just thrilled that it's happening.''

This week in the statehouse in Olympia, Wash., Gov. Jay Inslee fought but failed to bring a vote on a historic climate change policy that he has pursued for years: instituting the nation’s first tax on planet-warming carbon dioxide pollution.
The fate of the Senate vote, which was canceled on Thursday after it became clear that it could not gain enough support even in the Democratic-majority legislature of this West Coast state, was being watched closely around the country and the world. But for Mr. Inslee the loss of this week’s carbon-tax battle was just one step in a war to keep pushing his carbon plan, either as a ballot initiative this year — or possibly as part of a platform in a 2020 challenge against President Trump for the presidency.
In an interview, Governor Inslee declined to say whether he intends to run for president, but his name is increasingly appearing on lists of possible Democratic contenders.
Advocates and opponents of climate change action are paying close attention to Mr. Inslee’s next steps. Economists broadly agree that taxing the carbon pollution produced by burning fossil fuels is the most efficient way to fight climate change. But politicians agree that it is also a nearly surefire way to get voted out of office.
After all, a carbon tax is, by design, an energy tax. Among other things it would most likely raise the prices that voters pay for gasoline and electricity, which is why the idea has long been seen as politically toxic.
In the days before the vote, Governor Inslee said he would like to change that perception. “We are not afraid of being a vanguard,” he said in an interview in Washington, D.C. “We invented commercial jet airliners and the best software in the world,” he said, referring to Boeing and Microsoft, two global companies that rose up in his state. “In this case, we’re developing a new policy system, and we hope it would be followed.”
If he does run for president, Governor Inslee is expected to make climate change central to his platform. Governor Inslee, who has spent the past decade of his political career focusing on climate change, earning the sobriquet “greenest governor in America,” sees the issue as a way to directly attack Mr. Trump, who has mocked established climate science, rolled back environmental regulations and promised to withdraw the United States from the landmark Paris climate accord.
This past Sunday, Governor Inslee said, he made his views clear at a governors’ breakfast with Scott Pruitt, the head of Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency and the president’s point man in undoing climate change rules. “I told him, you’re killing my state,” Governor Inslee said of his conversation with Mr. Pruitt. “My state is going up in smoke because our forests are involved in these catastrophic fires.” He added, “I told him, this administration is not just irresponsible but morally reprehensible.”
An E.P.A. official didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from Mr. Pruitt.
The global interest in Governor Inslee’s carbon tax push comes as several state leaders are signaling to the world that they intend to act on climate change with or without the Trump administration. More significantly, the state has drawn attention as a major global economy that is willing to buck conventional wisdom by taking on a carbon tax at all.
“This is very significant. Washington is not just any state, it’s home to so many global companies: Starbucks, Microsoft, Amazon,” said Erik Solheim, the head of the United Nations Environment Program, speaking by phone from New Delhi, India. “It is part of the signal to the world that the major states, big business are in disagreement with the U.S. withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement, and they are doing something about it.”
Opponents of climate change policy, including the fossil fuel industry and allies of the Trump administration, also see the potential for a Washington carbon tax as seminal. “If it works in the state of Washington, it’s going to be tried in 10 states next year and 35 states the year after that,” said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist and political strategist who advised Mr. Trump’s campaign and transition. “If Inslee’s successful, it will be a game-changer. Everyone will take it and copy it and be off and running.”
Already, carbon tax bills have been introduced in the legislatures of Utah, Maryland, New York, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine and Washington, D.C.
Mr. McKenna said that he expects an effort to revive the carbon tax in a November ballot initiative vote to ignite a major campaign both for and against the effort.
Mr. McKenna is one of many analysts and strategists who see Governor Inslee’s push to pass a carbon tax in his home state as his first step toward a national campaign. “This is not just about the state of Washington. This is about Jay positioning himself is a national leader on climate change,” Mr. McKenna said. “He is testing out themes and strategies.”
Even if Governor Inslee’s tax push makes him a hero in the eyes of environmental advocates around the world, Republicans see it as a political liability, and are preparing to attack him on it.
“I’m a big fan of having votes on carbon taxes,” said Thomas J. Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank that supports fossil fuels and supplied the Trump administration with its energy policy blueprint, including rolling back climate change regulations and expanding coal and oil exploration. He recounted the history of politicians losing their jobs as a result of backing a price on carbon pollution.
There was Al Gore in 1993 when, as vice president, he urged Congress to pass an energy bill that would have taxed the heat content of burning fossil fuels. After Democrats pushed the bill through the House, Republicans attacked them for backing an energy tax, and the vote was seen as a key reason that Democrats lost control of the House in 1996.
The pattern was repeated in 2009, when President Barack Obama tried to push Congress to pass a so-called cap-and-trade bill, which would have required carbon polluters to pay for permits to pollute. The bill passed in the House but cost coal-state Democrats their seats.
Carbon taxes have helped fell politicians around the world. In 2012, Prime Minister Julia Gillard of Australia successfully pushed to pass a carbon tax. The following year, she was ousted from office in a campaign that was partly seen as a referendum on the tax.
Although Hillary Clinton campaigned in 2016 on a pledge to tackle climate change, she stopped short of endorsing a carbon tax. “Even Obama recognized, even Hillary Clinton recognized, that a carbon tax is politically toxic,” Mr. Pyle said. Governor Inslee, he said, is “going to find out real quickly that it doesn’t play in Peoria.”
Even some people who have voted for Governor Inslee express concern about how a carbon tax might be used against him in the hardball of a national political campaign. “I would like to see him run,” said Dan Rystrom, 56, a retired investor from a suburb of Seattle who identified himself as a Democrat. “But I think it would be the end of him,” he said, describing the political ads he expected to see across the country, saying: “Who is this man from the West Coast who just raised the prices of gasoline?”
Still, there are signs that other politicians might be willing to take the carbon tax plunge. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pushing to implement a national carbon tax by the end of the year. And while Washington would be the first state in the nation with a straight carbon tax, it is not the first to force polluters to pay for emitting carbon dioxide: As governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a cap-and-trade law in 2006.
Many environmental economists say that in order for a carbon tax to significantly cut planet-warming pollution, it should be set at a rate of $30 to $50 per ton of pollution. The proposed Washington state tax is $12 a ton, although it would increase at $2 per year until it reaches $30.
The tax is also likely to have a smaller impact on Washington’s economy than it might in other states, because of its unique energy mix. The state gets most of its electricity from carbon-free hydropower, rather than coal.
In the interview, Governor Inslee said that whoever ultimately runs against Mr. Trump in 2020 on the Democrat side should put climate change front and center in his or her campaign. The politics of global warming are changing, he said, as more Americans experiencing economically damaging weather events that scientists can attribute to the changing climate.
“Climate change used to be an abstraction. It used to be a graph,” he said. “Now we’re seeing biblical events play out on the 6 o’clock evening news.”
“I believe it is a successful and winning issue,” Governor Inslee said.

Highlight: By the end of this century, some parts of the world could face as many as six climate-related crises at the same time, researchers have concluded.


Body


Global warming is posing such wide-ranging risks to humanity, involving so many types of phenomena, that by the end of this century some parts of the world could face as many as six climate-related crises at the same time, researchers say.
This chilling prospect is described in a paper published Monday in Nature Climate Change, a respected academic journal, that shows the effects of climate change across a broad spectrum of problems, including heat waves, wildfires, sea level rise, hurricanes, flooding, drought and shortages of clean water.
Such problems are already coming in combination, said the lead author, Camilo Mora of the University of Hawaii at Manoa. He noted that Florida had recently experienced extreme drought, record high temperatures and wildfires — and also Hurricane Michael, the powerful Category 4 storm that slammed into the Panhandle last month. Similarly, California is suffering through            the worst wildfires the state has ever seen, as well as drought, extreme heat waves and degraded air quality that            threatens the health of residents.
Things will get worse, the authors wrote. The paper projects future trends and suggests that, by 2100, unless humanity takes forceful action to curb the greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change, some tropical coastal areas of the planet, like the Atlantic coast of South and Central America, could be hit by as many as six crises at a time.
That prospect is “like a terror movie that is real,” Dr. Mora said.
The authors include a list of caveats about the research: Since it is a review of papers, it will reflect some of the potential biases of science in this area, which include the possibility that scientists might focus on negative effects more than positive ones; there is also a margin of uncertainty involved in discerning the imprint of climate change from natural variability.
New York can expect to be hit by four climate crises at a time by 2100 if carbon emissions continue at their current pace, the study says, but if emissions are cut significantly that number could be reduced to one. The troubled regions of the coastal tropics could see their number of concurrent hazards reduced from six to three.
The paper explores the ways that climate change intensifies hazards and describes the interconnected nature of such crises. Greenhouse gas emissions, by warming the atmosphere, can enhance drought in places that are normally dry, “ripening conditions for wildfires and heat waves,” the researchers say. In wetter areas, a warmer atmosphere retains more moisture and strengthens downpours, while higher sea levels increase storm surge and warmer ocean waters can contribute to the overall destructiveness of storms.
In a scientific world marked by specialization and siloed research, this multidisciplinary effort by 23 authors reviewed more than 3,000 papers on various effects of climate change. The authors determined 467 ways in which those changes in climate affect human physical and mental health, food security, water availability, infrastructure and other facets of life on Earth.
The paper concludes that traditional research into one element of climate change and its effects can miss the bigger picture of interrelation and risk.
Climate change also has different ramifications for the world’s haves and have-nots, the authors found: “The largest losses of human life during extreme climatic events occurred in developing nations, whereas developed nations commonly face a high economic burden of damages and requirements for adaptation.”
People are not generally attuned to dealing with problems like climate change, Dr. Mora said. “We as humans don’t feel the pain of people who are far away or far into the future,” he said. “We normally care about people who are close to us or that are impacting us, or things that will happen tomorrow.”
And so, he said, people tend to look at events far in the future and tell themselves, “We can deal with these things later, we have more pressing problems now.” But, he added, this research “documented how bad this already is.”
The paper includes an interactive map of the various hazards under different emissions scenarios for any location in the world, produced by Esri, which develops geographic information systems. “We see that climate change is literally redrawing the lines on the map, and revealing the threats that our world faces at every level,” said Dawn Wright, the company’s chief scientist.
Michael E. Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University who was not involved in the paper, said it underscored the urgency for action to curb the effects of climate change and showed that “the costs of inaction greatly outweigh the costs of taking action.”
Dr. Mann published a recent paper suggesting that climate change effects on the jet stream are contributing to a range of extreme summer weather events, such as heat waves in North America, Europe and Asia, wildfires in California and flooding in Japan. The new study, he said, dovetails with that research, and “is, if anything, overly conservative” — that is, it may underestimate the threats and costs associated with human-caused climate change.
A co-author of the new paper, Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, hailed its interdisciplinary approach. “There’s more than one kind of risk out there,” he said, but scientists tend to focus on their area of research. “Nations, societies in general, have to deal with multiple hazards, and it’s important to put the whole picture together.”
Like military leaders developing the capability to fight wars on more than one front, governments have to be ready to face more than one climate crisis at a time, Dr. Emanuel said.
Dr. Mora said he had considered writing a book or a movie that would reflect the frightening results of the research. His working title, which describes how dire the situation is for humanity, is unprintable here. His alternate title, he said, is “We Told You So.”

Heat Waves in the Age of Climate Change: Longer, More Frequent and More Dangerous


 



Heat Waves in the Age of Climate Change: Longer, More Frequent and More Dangerous

Highlight: The average number of heat waves in 50 major American cities has tripled since the 1960s.

Two-thirds of the United States is expected to bake under what could be record high temperatures heading into the weekend. As a result, government agencies have issued warnings that can feel ominous.
An “oppressive and dangerous heat,” warned the National Weather Service. “Excessive heat, a ‘silent killer’,” echoed a news release by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Extreme heat is hazardous,” tweeted the NYCEmergency Management Department.
 But people with health issues, older people and young children are especially susceptible to the effects of extreme heat. It’s a threat that grows as climate change continues.
Climate change makes heat waves more frequent
To understand how climate change increases the frequency of heat waves, it helps to think of the Earth’s temperature as a bell curve said Michael Mann, the director of the Penn State Earth System Science Center.
Climate change is shifting that bell curve toward the hotter part of the temperature scale. Even a tiny shift in the center means that more of the curve touches the extreme part of the temperature scale.
“So you know, a warming of 1 degree Celsius, which is what we’ve seen thus far, can lead to a 10-fold increase in the frequency of 100 degree days in New York City for example,” said Dr. Mann. According to the U.S. Global Change Research Program, since the 1960s the average number of heat waves — defined as two or more consecutive days where daily lows exceeded historical July and August temperatures — in 50 major American cities has tripled. 
The program used historic lows because the most serious impacts of extreme heat tend to come when nighttime temperatures don’t cool off. By the 2010s, the average number of heat waves had risen from an average of two per year in the 1960s to the current average of nearly six per year. 
Climate change is also making heat waves longer
There’s another way that climate change worsens heat waves: by changing the jet stream. Those air currents in the atmosphere help move weather systems around and are driven by temperature differences, which are shrinking. So when heat waves arrive, they stay in place longer.
“We’re warming up the Arctic faster than the rest of the northern hemisphere,” said Dr. Mann. “So that’s decreasing that temperature contrast from the subtropics to the pole, and it’s that temperature contrast that drives the jet stream in the first place.” 
At the same time, under certain circumstances the jet stream can get “stuck” between an atmospheric wall in the subtropics, and at the Arctic, trapping weather systems in place.
 “That’s when you get these record breaking weather events," said Dr. Mann, “either the unprecedented heat wave and drought, to wildfires and floods.” 
This accounts for last summer’s European heat wave, as well as the recent European heat wave, he says, and is behind the current North American heat wave. 
Nationwide, the time period in which heat waves might be expected to occur is 45 days longer than it was in the 1960s, according to the U.S. Global Change Research Program.
Heat deaths may soon surpass deaths from cold weather
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which uses methods most in accordance with global standards, currently, cold weather kills more people than hot weather does.
But as global temperatures increase, the number of deaths associated with extreme cold are predicted to decrease. At the same time, the number of deaths associated with extreme heat will increase. And those deaths, according to the National Climate Assessment, will exceed the decline in deaths from extreme cold, meaning an overall increase in mortality.

It’s important to note that not everyone suffers equally when temperatures soar. In addition to the vulnerable groups, like elderly people, it also matters where you live. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, analyzed data from the 2000 census and found that people of color were up to 52 percent more likely to live in the hottest parts of cities. 
Similarly, Eric Klinenberg, the director of the Institute for Public Knowledge at New York University, found that during the 1995 Chicago heat wave that killed more than 700 people, the death tolls were highest in places that were not just poor and segregated, but what he calls “institutionally depleted.”
“In a heat wave and many climate events, it’s social isolation that proves to be truly dangerous,” he said. “If you’re home and alone in a heat wave when you’re old and frail you’re more likely to die if you don’t have air conditioning.”
The solution is reining in greenhouse gas emissions, said Dr. Mann.
If we don’t, he said, “think about the most extreme summer heat you’ve ever experienced in your lifetime. That will become a typical summer day by the middle of this century, if we continue on the path that we’re on.”

Big Business Vows to Fight Climate Change. How? When?

In Davos, business leaders were newly vocal about the danger, though they gave few details about how they would reform their practices.
DAVOS, Switzerland -- Business titans who for decades brushed off warnings about climate change arrived at the annual World Economic Forum this week ready to show their newfound enthusiasm for the cause. 
  Having previously played down the need for the reform that scientists had urged, finance leaders and company chiefs conspicuously rallied around a consensus that accelerating global temperatures pose a significant risk to society -- and to business.
  Missing, though, was a clear answer to the question of what exactly they would do about it and how quickly.
  ''It's an increase in rhetoric, absolutely,'' said Alison Martin, who leads the Europe, Middle East and Africa divisions of Zurich Insurance. ''Will we see a walking of the talking? The jury is out.''
  After months of global climate protests that drew millions of young people, a raft of companies said this week in Davos that they would aim to lower their emissions of planet-warming gases to net zero by 2050 or earlier. A coalition of major financial institutions, representing $4.3 trillion in assets, said it would take steps to minimize carbon-heavy investments in its portfolios and lobbied other investors to join it.
  A group of 140 of the world's largest companies pledged to develop a core set of common metrics to track environmental and social responsibility. And companies and government leaders, including President Trump, who has rolled back dozens of environmental and climate policies, said they would aim to plant one trillion new trees around the world, at the behest of Marc Benioff.
  ''The tree is a bipartisan issue,'' said Mr. Benioff, a co-founder and the co-chief executive of Salesforce. ''No one is anti-tree.''
  The window of time to avert the worst impacts of climate change is rapidly closing, according to numerous scientific reports. And while critics blame big business for decades of inaction, as well as the active suppression of climate science, many major companies now acknowledge the immediate need for change.
  ''The measurements all show that we are clearly not doing enough yet,'' Feike Sijbesma, the chief executive of DSM, a Dutch health company, said at Davos.
  The pledges were the latest in a string of climate-related announcements in recent weeks.
  BlackRock, the world's largest institutional investor, said it would place climate change at the center of its investment strategy. Microsoft said it would not only go carbon negative -- reducing more greenhouse gases than it adds to the environment -- but also somehow remove all the emissions the company has ever produced. Lloyds, the British financial group, pledged to cut by ''more than 50 percent'' the carbon emissions generated by the projects it finances by 2030.
  Larry Fink, BlackRock's chief executive, showed up to meetings wearing a wool scarf that represented the decades of warming since the industrial age, a Christmas present from a nonprofit organization that works on climate issues.
  ''I've never seen a social issue explode like this,'' said Paul Tudor Jones II, the investor and founder of Just Capital, which ranks companies based on sustainability factors. ''Every single C.E.O. and board is having to figure out what their carbon footprint is and what they're going to do about it.''
  Behind this flurry of corporate commitments is a growing concern about tangible risks to the bottom line, including the prospect that ratings agencies will factor in climate risk, pressure from younger employees, changing consumer preferences and government regulations like a carbon tax.
  Extreme weather events are already causing economic havoc. The California wildfires last year were estimated to have caused $25.4 billion in damage. Pacific Gas & Electric, the largest energy producer in the state, has filed for bankruptcy.
  Jesper Brodin, the chief executive of Ikea, said his company was already feeling the impact. Severe flooding in the United States temporarily closed many of its stores. Energy prices in Sweden skyrocketed during a recent heat wave. Fires in Australia have disrupted business there.
  Arne Sorenson, the chief executive of Marriott, said the hotel chain was also feeling the brunt. ''We have hotels in Puerto Rico that are still closed,'' he said. ''We're going to see the impact of fires and storms.''
  A report this week from the Bank for International Settlements, which represents central banks, said climate change could cause the next financial crisis. Mark Carney, the departing Bank of England governor who has spearheaded efforts to get central banks to carry out stress tests assessing climate impacts on sectors, said companies needed to examine and disclose their strategies and timelines for lowering their carbon footprints.
  ''This is a whole-of-economy transition. In every sector, there will be companies that will be part of the solution,'' Mr. Carney said. ''Those who lag are going to be punished.''
  Despite talk of the risks, few companies and investors provided details at Davos on how they would rapidly transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels. Just a fraction of global businesses currently disclose the financial risks posed by climate change. Even fewer have set their own targets and timetables to do what the science demands: Reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by half over the next decade.
  While global investment in renewable energy hit $289 billion in 2018, far exceeding the investment in new fossil fuel power, wind and solar remain a small portion of total energy production.
  Ms. Martin, of Zurich Insurance, said the real evidence of change would come when investors started exiting carbon-heavy companies, especially those with no transition plan. ''What is going to cause the change?'' she added. ''If capital actually does start to fly, if it does actually make choices.''
  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ridiculed calls for fossil fuel divestment, singling out the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who called on the Davos crowd on Tuesday to immediately halt investments in oil, gas and coal.
  Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Mr. Mnuchin belittled Ms. Thunberg. ''After she goes and studies economics in college, she can come back and explain that to us,'' he said.
  Ms. Thunberg responded tartly on Twitter, saying that ''it doesn't take a college degree in economics to realise that our remaining 1.5° carbon budget and ongoing fossil fuel subsidies and investments don't add up.''
  Mr. Mnuchin also played down the need for new regulation. ''We don't believe there should be carbon taxes,'' he said on CNBC. ''We want to cut taxes. We think that industry can deal with this issue on its own.''
  The World Economic Forum's annual global risk report this year ranked climate and environmental hazards as the top five concerns facing the world in the next decade for the first time. But a separate survey of business executives about the top 10 risks in the next 12 months made no mention of climate.
  One measure of a newfound awareness, said Stefan Rahmstorf, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, was how many invitations that researchers like him were now receiving from the titans of global capital. Dr. Rahmstorf said that while he was frustrated that the business community had for decades blocked efforts to address rising greenhouse gas emissions, he was also hopeful about the change he was witnessing.
  ''The business community is increasingly not trying to lobby against decarbonization and solving the climate crisis,'' he said. ''They are realizing something has to be done and something has to change.''

Having previously played down the need for the reform that scientists had urged, finance leaders and company chiefs conspicuously rallied around a consensus that accelerating global temperatures pose a significant risk to society — and to business.
Missing, though, was a clear answer to the question of what exactly they would do about it and how quickly.
“It’s an increase in rhetoric, absolutely,” said Alison Martin, who leads the Europe, Middle East and Africa divisions of Zurich Insurance. “Will we see a walking of the talking? The jury is out.”
After months of global climate protests that drew millions of young people, a raft of companies said this week in Davos that they would aim to lower their emissions of planet-warming gases to net zero by 2050 or earlier. A            coalition of major financial institutions, representing $4.3 trillion in assets, said it would take steps to minimize carbon-heavy investments in its portfolios and lobbied other investors to join it.
A group of 140 of the world’s largest companies pledged to develop a core set of common metrics to track environmental and social responsibility. And companies and government leaders, including President Trump, who has            rolled back dozens of environmental and climate policies, said they would aim to plant one trillion new trees around the world, at the behest of Marc Benioff.
“The tree is a bipartisan issue,” said Mr. Benioff, a co-founder and the co-chief executive of Salesforce. “No one is anti-tree.”
The window of time to avert the worst impacts of climate change is rapidly closing, according to numerous scientific reports. And while critics blame big business for decades of inaction, as well as the active suppression of climate science, many major companies now acknowledge the immediate need for change.
“The measurements all show that we are clearly not doing enough yet,” Feike Sijbesma, the chief executive of DSM, a Dutch health company, said at Davos.
The pledges were the latest in a string of climate-related announcements in recent weeks.
BlackRock, the world’s largest institutional investor, said it would placeclimate change at the center of its investment strategy. Microsoft said it would not only go carbon negative — reducing more greenhouse gases than it adds to the environment — but also somehow            remove all the emissions the company has ever produced. Lloyds, the British financial group,            pledged to cut by “more than 50 percent” the carbon emissions generated by the projects it finances by 2030.
Larry Fink, BlackRock’s chief executive, showed up to meetings wearing a wool scarf that represented the decades of warming since the industrial age, a Christmas present from a nonprofit organization that works on climate issues.
“I’ve never seen a social issue explode like this,” said Paul Tudor Jones II, the investor and founder of Just Capital, which ranks companies based on sustainability factors. “Every single C.E.O. and board is having to figure out what their carbon footprint is and what they’re going to do about it.”
Behind this flurry of corporate commitments is a growing concern about tangible risks to the bottom line, including the prospect that ratings agencies will factor in climate risk, pressure from younger employees, changing consumer preferences and government regulations like a carbon tax.
Extreme weather events are already causing economic havoc. The California wildfires last year were estimated to have caused $25.4 billion in damage. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, the largest energy producer in the state, has filed for bankruptcy.
Jesper Brodin, the chief executive of Ikea, said his company was already feeling the impact. Severe flooding in the United States temporarily closed many of its stores. Energy prices in Sweden skyrocketed during a recent heat wave. Fires in Australia have disrupted business there.
Arne Sorenson, the chief executive of Marriott, said the hotel chain was also feeling the brunt. “We have hotels in Puerto Rico that are still closed,” he said. “We’re going to see the impact of fires and storms.”
A report this week from the Bank for International Settlements, which represents central banks, said climate change could cause the next financial crisis. Mark Carney, the departing Bank of England governor who has spearheaded efforts to get central banks to carry out stress tests assessing climate impacts on sectors, said companies needed to examine and disclose their strategies and timelines for lowering their carbon footprints.
“This is a whole-of-economy transition. In every sector, there will be companies that will be part of the solution,” Mr. Carney said. “Those who lag are going to be punished.”
Despite talk of the risks, few companies and investors provided details at Davos on how they would rapidly transition away from an economy based on fossil fuels. Just a fraction of global businesses currently disclose the financial risks posed by climate change. Even fewer have set their own targets and timetables to do what the science demands: Reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by half over the next decade.
While global investment in renewable energy hit $289 billion in 2018, far exceeding the investment in new fossil fuel power, wind and solar remain a small portion of total energy production.
Ms. Martin, of Zurich Insurance, said the real evidence of change would come when investors started exiting carbon-heavy companies, especially those with no transition plan. “What is going to cause the change?” she added. “If capital actually does start to fly, if it does actually make choices.”
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ridiculed calls for fossil fuel divestment, singling out the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who called on the Davos crowd on Tuesday to immediately halt investments in oil, gas and coal.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Mr. Mnuchin belittled Ms. Thunberg. “After she goes and studies economics in college, she can come back and explain that to us,” he said.
Ms. Thunberg responded tartly on Twitter, saying that “it doesn’t take a college degree in economics to realise that our remaining 1.5° carbon budget and ongoing fossil fuel subsidies and investments don’t add up.”
Mr. Mnuchin also played down the need for new regulation. “We don’t believe there should be carbon taxes,” he said on CNBC. “We want to cut taxes. We think that industry can deal with this issue on its own.”
The World Economic Forum’s annual global risk report this year ranked climate and environmental hazards as the top five concerns facing the world in the next decade for the first time. But a separate survey of business executives about the top 10 risks in the next 12 months made no mention of climate.
One measure of a newfound awareness, said Stefan Rahmstorf, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, was how many invitations that researchers like him were now receiving from the titans of global capital. Dr. Rahmstorf said that while he was frustrated that the business community had for decades blocked efforts to address rising greenhouse gas emissions, he was also hopeful about the change he was witnessing.
“The business community is increasingly not trying to lobby against decarbonization and solving the climate crisis,” he said. “They are realizing something has to be done and something has to change.”

Highlight: The San Francisco Fed  warned that banks, communities and homeowners face significant financial risk from climate change and offered proposals for  banks to do more to help.

WASHINGTON — Home values could fall significantly.
Banks could stop lending to flood-prone communities.
Towns could lose the tax money they need to build sea walls and other protections.
These are a few of the warnings published on Thursday by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco regarding the financial risks of climate change. The collection of 18 papers by outside experts amounts to one of the most specific and dire accountings of the dangers posed to businesses and communities in the United States — a threat so significant that the nation’s central bank seems increasingly compelled to address it.
The Federal Reserve has been slow to talk about climate risks compared with central banks in other countries. That could be partly because the topic is more politically polarized in the United States than many other places, so talking about it exposes the Fed — which is meant to be politically independent — to accusations that it is straying into partisan territory. Already, the central bank is a frequent target of President Trump, who has criticized its interest-rate decisions for hindering economic growth. 
Yet the Fed has recently started speaking up on global warming and the dangers it poses to the financial system. 
In a letter to Senator Brian Schatz this year, Chair Jerome H. Powell wrote that the Fed takes “severe weather events” into account in its role as a financial supervisor. Meanwhile, the San Francisco branch of the Federal Reserve — responsible for banking oversight across a major swath of the American West — has been more blunt,            writing this past March that volatility related to climate change has become “increasingly relevant” as a consideration for the central bank.
With Thursday’s actions, the San Francisco Fed has taken a further step. The research, conducted by 38 academics and practitioners from around the country and published with the knowledge of the Fed’s board of governors, presents in precise language a dire picture of the risks of a changing climate, and warns that local governments don’t have the means to deal with them. 
“The associated risks and effects of climate change are relevant considerations for the Federal Reserve,” Ian Galloway, director of the San Francisco Fed’s Center for Community Development Investments, said by email. 
The new research calls on lenders and other businesses involved in community development “to take a leadership role in preparing vulnerable regions most at risk for a ‘new abnormal,’” Mr. Galloway wrote in a foreword to the papers, which appeared in the journal Community Development Innovation Review.
As the research makes clear, that new abnormal is already here.

Climate change has begun to affect the real estate market, according to a paper by Asaf Bernstein, an economist at the University of Colorado in Boulder, and two co-authors. His research shows that properties likely to be under water if seas rise one foot now sell for 15 percent less than comparable properties with no flood threat.
That decline in property values is likely to ripple through the financial system, scaring banks and other lenders away from those areas, according to a paper by Michael Berman, a former chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association, which represents lenders.
It could also lead to a practice Mr. Berman described as “blue-lining,” where banks would avoid lending to flood-prone areas — a reference to the practice known as redlining, in which banks discriminate against African-American neighborhoods by not lending there.
“At some point in the next 20 to 30 years, absent substantial new approaches to reducing and managing flood risk, there may be a threat to the availability of the 30-year mortgage in various vulnerable and highly exposed areas,” wrote Mr. Berman, who is president and chief executive of M &amp; T Realty Capital Corporation, a major mortgage lender. 
The result, Mr. Berman said, would be to further imperil the financial health of places, particularly poorer ones, already struggling with flooding. “There is a real possibility that real estate values in communities will be decreasing due to increased flood risk just as the real estate tax base is being relied on for funding of new flood mitigation infrastructure,” he wrote.
Coastal cities are already unable to pay for the types of projects that could protect them from the growing effects of climate change, the authors of another paper wrote.
“Even large, affluent cities do not currently have the financial capacity in place to fund all of their plans,” wrote John Cleveland, executive director of the Boston Green Ribbon Commission, a group working to shield that city from climate change.
The papers propose a series of changes that could alter the behavior of financial institutions and local governments, pushing them to better prepare for climate change. Many of the steps would impose new restrictions or incentives on banks. 
One recommendation is for regulators to penalize banks that lend money in areas that have been hit by disasters, yet have not taken steps to protect themselves against similar future disasters. Banks could also be rewarded by regulators for financing projects that leave communities less vulnerable to flooding or other hazards. 
Another proposal is for lenders to create a common standard for measuring flood risk, and use it to set mortgage rates. 
A spokesman for the San Francisco Fed, Tom Flannigan, said the Fed “does not advocate on any policy positions,” but instead seeks to “share expert opinions and research while supporting the thoughtful exchange of ideas on subjects like climate change that we recognize to be important in our district.”
Still, change is necessary, according to Jesse M. Keenan, the editor of the papers. He argued that the private sector must assume a greater role in preparing for the effects of climate change.
“The private sector has always adapted,” Mr. Keenan, a faculty member at Harvard University, wrote in the introduction to the research. “One either adapts to new markets, products or services, or they go out of business.”

Plaintiffs Far From Coast Sue Over Climate Change

Until recently, communities suing fossil fuel companies over the costs of climate change have been located on the coasts: cities and counties in California, and New York City. But now, the litigation has jumped inland.
Boulder and San Miguel Counties in Colorado, along with the city of Boulder, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday against two oil companies, Exxon Mobil and Suncor Energy, the Canadian giant. The suit, filed in state court, argues that fossil fuels sold by the companies contribute to climate change, which in turn has exacerbated wildfires, droughts, severe storms and other symptoms of a warming planet that have far-ranging effects on agriculture and tourism. 
  Dealing with these climate-related issues, the suit says, places a burden on local governments. ''Our communities and our taxpayers should not shoulder the cost of climate change adaptation alone,'' said Suzanne Jones, Boulder's mayor. ''These oil companies need to pay their fair share.''
  The earlier lawsuits have largely focused on the obvious link between climate change, namely rising sea levels and damage to infrastructure. This new climate suit, far from the coasts, suggests that more communities around the country might take on energy companies in court. Each case could mean billions of dollars in damages.
  But not without a fight. Exxon Mobil and its allies have pushed back hard.
  Exxon gave notice in January in a state court in Texas that it planned to countersue, which would allow the company to demand documents and depositions from the communities. The fossil fuel company defendants have also acted together in California courts to have suits dismissed, arguing that climate change is a ''national and global issue'' best decided by legislatures and nations, not by the courts.
  Industry pressure has not deterred officials like Kathrin Sears, the supervisor for District 3 of Marin County, Calif., which brought one of the first suits. ''We expected from the get-go that there would be strong pushback, and that this would be a fight,'' she said. ''We're not intimidated by this stuff.''
  As for the newcomers, she said, ''It's good to have company.''
  The state-level climate lawsuits focus on the area of nuisance under common law, which allows courts to hold parties responsible for actions that interfere with the use of property.
  Attempts at the federal-court level to use nuisance in climate change litigation, in cases such as American Electric Power v. Connecticut, have been unsuccessful. In a unanimous 2011 decision, the Supreme Court said that the Clean Air Act displaced the federal common law of nuisance, leaving enforcement and regulation to the Environmental Protection Agency.
  The new wave of cases relies on the nuisance doctrine at the state level, working from the theory that state common law has not been similarly displaced. The companies, understandably, have tried to get the cases moved to federal court, with mixed success.
  In one case, Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court in San Francisco has suggested that the federal courts could still hear such cases. He kept the suits filed by San Francisco and Oakland and ordered a ''tutorial'' on climate change to familiarize himself with the scientific issues before setting a trial. In another case, Judge Vincent Chhabria -- also of Federal District Court in San Francisco -- sent the cases of California's San Mateo and Marin counties and the City of Imperial Beach to state court.
  Exxon has said its opponents are stifling ''its First Amendment right to participate in the national dialogue about climate change and climate policy.'' And, it has argued that it is a victim of a ''conspiracy'' brought by environmental zealots funded by activist philanthropists like the Rockefeller family.
  In addition, in a line of counterattack, the company has argued that while the lawsuits against it claim that ''imminent sea level rise presented a substantial threat,'' municipalities and counties did not disclose the threat of climate change in their bond offerings.
  The National Association of Manufacturers, which supports the fossil fuel companies, has focused on that point in a spirited campaign against the communities and their lawyers. In April, the group's Manufacturers' Accountability Project sent a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission demanding an investigation of ''potential wrongdoing'' by those suing. When the Colorado case was announced, the group denounced the ''baseless lawsuit'' as ''another example of trial attorneys attempting to enrich themselves at the expense of manufacturers and manufacturing workers.''
  Daniel A. Zarrilli, New York City's chief resilience officer, rejected the industry's argument that local governments are being enticed into filing the suits by trial lawyers. ''They're going to throw a lot of things at the wall and see what sticks,'' he said.
  While most of the communities and environmental groups involved in these lawsuits can be considered on the liberal side of the political spectrum, one of the groups collaborating on the Colorado cases is decidedly not: the Niskanen Center, a libertarian policy group in Washington with a climate focus.
  Jerry Taylor, the group's president, said there was a conservative case for the suits. Rather than push for regulations, he said, it is better to deal with climate change in the courts, as a property rights issue.
  David Bookbinder, a litigator who is working on the case with Niskanen, said that the companies had performed extensive research into climate change while paying others to help disseminate climate misinformation. ''They knew this was going to happen,'' he said of the companies, ''and our taxpayers did not.'' He added: ''So why should we have to bear the burden of it?''
  While the cases are generally considered long shots, legal underpinnings exist for the arguments, said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. But, he said, ''The lawsuits are, without question, pushing the envelope of nuisance law and tort law.''
  Should the cases reach the United States Supreme Court, Mr. Burger suggested that the communities' chances would be slim. Even so, the litigation pressure on the companies could lead to settlements that would include changes in how the companies operate. They could, for example, trade a framework for carbon taxes that could finance infrastructure for protection from legal liability.
  Exxon, which has publicly acknowledged climate change and supported the Paris climate agreement, has already said that it would support a carbon tax.
  Serge Dedina, the mayor of Imperial Beach, Calif., who brought one of the first suits, said he expected more pressure to come from companies like Exxon. ''They're really good at that,'' he said. ''If Exxon Mobil spent as much time cleaning up their operations as they do fighting people who are trying to protect the planet, we'd be a lot better off.''

Highlight: The Government Accountability Office says costs to the federal Treasury from climate change will continue to rise.


Body


WASHINGTON — Fires, floods and hurricanes are already costing the federal government tens of billions of dollars a year and climate change will drive those costs ever higher in coming years, a new federal study warns.
The report by the Government Accountability Office, Congress’s auditing arm, urges the Trump administration to take climate change risks seriously and begin formulating a response.
The study, scheduled to be released Tuesday, says that different sectors of the economy and different parts of the country will be harmed in ways that are difficult to predict. But one estimate projects that rising temperatures could cause losses in labor productivity of as much as $150 billion by 2099, while changes in some crop yields could cost as much as $53 billion. The Southwest will suffer more costly wildfires, the Southeast will see more heat-related deaths and the Northwest must prepare for diminished shellfish harvests.
The report acknowledges that it is difficult to pinpoint the costs of disasters that can be directly attributed to climate change. And the projected fiscal burden remains less than 1 percent of the current $3.8 trillion federal budget.
But Senators Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, and            Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who jointly requested the report, said between the lines of a conservative government audit was an urgent economic message that Washington should heed.
“The Government Accountability Office — if you will, the chief bean counter — is basically telling us that this is costing us a lot of money,” Ms. Cantwell said. “We need to understand that as stewards of the taxpayer that climate is a fiscal issue, and the fact that it’s having this big a fiscal impact on our federal budget needs to be dealt with.”
The report, two years in the making, comes as the Senate prepares to vote this week on a $36.5 billion disaster-relief package to fund hurricane relief, a flood insurance program and wildfire recovery efforts in the West.
Ms. Cantwell and Ms. Collins noted that the White House Office of Management and Budget had calculated that extreme weather events over the past decade cost the federal government $350 billion.
Both asserted that the study should help move Congress and the administration past partisan fights over the science of global warming and toward a search for solutions — something they said could be problematic given that the Trump administration is rolling back many of former President Barack Obama’s climate change initiatives.
“My hope is the administration will take a look at this report and realize there is an economic impact here that is significant,” Ms. Collins said. “We simply cannot afford the billions of dollars in additional funding that’s going to be needed if we do not take into account the consequences of climate change.”
The G.A.O. study draws on interviews with 26 scientific and economic experts and 30 studies, though it focuses most heavily on the only two national-scale studies analyzing the economic effects of climate change. One of them is an ongoing research project being produced by the Environmental Protection Agency, and the other is a study by several organizations led by the Rhodium Group that analyzed the potential costs associated with climate change in coastal property, health, agriculture, energy, labor productivity and crime.
Trevor Houser, a partner at the Rhodium Group, which led the American Climate Prospectus study, said the accounting was on the conservative side. The agriculture analysis, for example, looked only at how changes in temperature and precipitation would affect four commodity crops. It did not study the fiscal fallout of events like wildfires and did not take into account the costs of infectious diseases linked to climate change.
“Climate change is clear and present danger to the U.S. economy and the fiscal health of the U.S. government, and that risk is really unevenly spread,” Mr. Houser said. “It needs to be actively managed by the federal government.”
J. Alfredo Gomez, one of the lead authors of the G.A.O. study, said the federal government had identified climate change as a significant economic risk since 2013. This study, he said, asks the administration to use the detailed data to prepare for the inevitable.
Robert N. Stavins, an economist at Harvard University, said he doubted the study would convince either Republicans in Congress or the White House to act.
“The G.A.O. study is conservative, it’s not alarmist, it’s realistic and balanced and they go out of their way to point out all of the uncertainties involved,” Mr. Stavins said. “I don’t see any likelihood it’s going to be taken seriously.”

Politics intruded on science and intelligence. That’s why I quit my job as an analyst for the State Department.
Ten years ago, I left my job as a tenured university professor to work as an intelligence analyst for the federal government, primarily in the State Department but with an intervening tour at the National Intelligence Council. My focus was on the impact of environmental and climate change on national security, a growing concern of the military and intelligence communities. It was important work. Two words that national security professionals abhor are uncertainty and surprise, and there’s no question that the changing climate promises ample amounts of both.
I always appreciated the apolitical nature of the work. Our job in the State Department’s Bureau of Intelligence and Research was to generate intelligence analysis buttressed by the best information available, without regard to political considerations. And although I was uncomfortable with some policies of the Trump administration, no one had ever tried to influence my work or conclusions.
That changed last month, when the White House blockedthe submission of my bureau’s written testimony on the national security implications of climate change to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The stated reason was that the scientific foundation of the analysis did not comport with the administration’s position on climate change.
After an extended exchange between officials at the White House and the State Department, at the 11th hour I was permitted to appear at the hearing and give a five-minute  summary of the 11-page testimony. However, Congress was deprived of the full analysis, including the scientific baseline from which it was drawn. Perhaps most important, this written testimony on a critical topic was never entered into the official record. 
The bottom line of written testimony was this: “Climate change will have wide-ranging implications for U.S. national security over the next 20 years.” In developing this assessment, I drew from peer-reviewed scientific studies and findings of the government’s own scientists. This conclusion was hardly new.  The intelligence community has repeatedly warned of the dangers that climate change poses to national security. Early this year, for instance, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, warned in the annual “Worldwide Threat Assessment,” “Global environmental and ecological degradation, as well as climate change, are likely to fuel competition for resources, economic distress, and social discontent through 2019 and beyond.” (On Sunday, President Trump announced that Mr. Coats            would step down shortly, to be replaced by one of his biggest defenders, Representative John Ratcliffe, a Texas Republican.)
In blocking the submission of the written testimony, the White House trampled not only on the scientific integrity of the assessment but also on the analytic independence of an arm of the intelligence community. That’s why I recently resigned from the job I considered a sacred duty, and the institution I loved.
As a tenured professor trained in physics and chemistry, I was admittedly an unusual fit for the intelligence community. I likely would never have considered the move if not for a program run by the American Association for the Advancement of Science that connects Ph.D. scientists to roles within the U.S. government to shape and inform policy. I found a home in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research, the oldest civilian intelligence agency in the government and well known for its history of analytic sharpness and courageous dissent. 
Science has long intersected with intelligence analysis. Indeed it would be difficult if not impossible to elucidate the ramifications of nuclear materials, near-earth objects, infectious diseases and many other pressing national security concerns without a deep understanding of the foundational science of each. This, too, applies to climate change.
Decades of scientific measurements have established that global temperatures are increasing and ocean waters are acidifying. These changes produce shifts in a vast number of earth system processes: in the atmosphere, ocean, freshwater, soil, ice masses, permafrost and organisms making up the biosphere. Some effects are well known, like increased frequency and intensity of heat waves and droughts, and rising sea levels. Others are less familiar, like decreasing oceanic oxygen levels and the redistribution of species. 
These events do not arise in isolation but combine with existing social and political conditions and can disrupt societies and nations. They harm people directly or degrade the social, political, economic, agricultural, ecological or infrastructural systems that support them.
With these environmental changes we should expect disruptions to global water and food security, reduced economic security and weakened livelihoods, worsened human and animal health, and risks to the global supply chain on which the United States and its partners depend. Political instability, heightened tensions over resources, climate-linked humanitarian crises and adverse effects to militaries in some places are likely to increase. Migration will probably increase both within and between nations, with sociopolitical and resource implications already becoming clear.
Despite the increased politicization of climate change, I embraced the opportunity to participate in an unclassified congressional hearing on such an important matter. In particular, I welcomed the chance to engage Republican members of Congress on the topic because of the party’s historically strong support of other science and technology issues. Previous closed-door discussions persuaded me that at least some Republican lawmakers were open to the argument that climate change was a national security concern. I believe that once one accepts that global temperatures are increasing, a fact that only the most ardent climate disbeliever rejects, the case for that fact’s relevance to nation security directly follows.
When I joined the government in 2009, leadership was generally receptive to environmental security analysis. After the administration changed in 2017, my job was arguably even more important because of the skepticism within the Trump administrative over climate change. The intelligence community tries to deliver objective truth to decision makers — truth that persists irrespective of who occupies the White House.
I take great pride in the many positive and productive interactions I had with senior officials in my 30 months in the Trump administration. But the decision to block the written testimony is another example of a well-established pattern in the Trump administration of undercutting evidence that contradicts its policy positions. 
Beyond obstructing science, this action also undermined the analytic independence of a major element of the intelligence community. When a White House can shape or suppress intelligence analysis that it deems out of line with its political messaging, then the intelligence community has no true analytic independence. I believe such acts weaken our nation.
My last day on the job was July 12. In the weeks since the hearing I came to understand that there was little left for me to achieve in my position. More than most officers in the intelligence community, I interacted often with the public in discussions of environmental security issues. After the experiences of the prior two months, I wondered whether I could continue public engagements without being tainted by questions about my own analytic independence. 
Grappling with the implications of climate change and biodiversity loss, the two primary security concerns I’m focused on, is too important to me to wait around for a possible change on these issues in a future administration. We need to better understand and anticipate the challenges facing the nation and its partners. Whatever my next step might be, I believe these issues remain critical, and I will try to continue this work going forward.

Two dozen scientists, authors, and world and national figures answered two questions: What is your greatest worry about climate change? What gives you hope? Here are some of their answers, condensed for space.
JANE LUBCHENCO, Former administrator, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
I worry about oceans becoming more corrosive, decimating both fisheries and coral reefs. Oceans have already become 30 percent more acidic since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution; if business-as-usual carbon emissions continue, oceans are likely to be 150 percent more acidic by the end of this century. Yikes!
I take heart in knowing that social change can happen very rapidly once a tipping point is reached, that young people are bringing new passion and creativity to the issue, and that climate change is being seen increasingly as the moral issue it is.
TENZIN GYATSO, 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet
The worst possible aspect of climate change is that it will be irreversible and irrevocable. Therefore, there is the urgency to do whatever we can to protect the environment while we can.
When I was young, even I did not really think about the environment, nor did I hear much about it from others. Today, more and more people are trying to take action. We are beginning to look at this planet as our only home, and I am hopeful that this will lead to the generation of a genuine sense of universal responsibility. We can do this.
MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG, Former mayor of New York City and special United Nations envoy for cities and climate change 
Something like 90 percent of the world’s cities are on coasts, and in most places, the most vulnerable people in those cities will feel the worst impacts. We have a responsibility to do something about that. We can’t afford to sit back, cross our fingers and hope for the best.
A tremendous amount of progress is being made by cities all around the world. Cities account for some 70 percent of the emissions that cause climate change, so together they can make a big difference. In New York City back in 2007, we set a goal of reducing our carbon footprint 30 percent by 2030, and we got to a 19 percent reduction in just six years.
Mayors have powers they can use to address climate change immediately. They have control over many of the things that create emissions — like transportation and buildings — and they can invest in infrastructure. They’re not interested in turning the issue into a big political fight. They’re the ones most directly responsible for people’s safety and welfare — and they recognize the dangers of inaction.
JEFFREY SACHS, Director, Earth Institute of Columbia University
The oil industry has lobbied Washington to a state of paralysis, and as is so often true, greed is at the root of the crisis, with the politicians getting in line to feed at the oil trough. The climate deniers are not the real problem. Their transparent propaganda and misdirections are laughable; their scientific ignorance is impossible to miss. The real problem is the cowardice and greed of those who absolutely know better, both in government and industry.
We are living in an age of technological breakthroughs that could transform the world economy to a low-carbon energy system by midcentury. Solar, wind, geothermal, carbon sequestration, safe nuclear energy, and energy efficiency are all part of the mix. The oil industry should cooperate, rather than faking it or dodging it as until now.
BARBARA KINGSOLVER, Novelist; author of the memoir “Animal, Vegetable, Miracle”
My fear: Catastrophic extinction. We don’t get to make natural laws. Natural law made us, and it ultimately will unmake us. What makes me very sad is that we’re going to take so many species down with us.
My hope: We in the United States finally seem to be coming to the table after decades of either denial or argument. It seems as if denial as a political strategy has run its course and that we are stepping up to our responsibilities. I hope that’s true.
ALAN I. LESHNER, Chief executive, American Association for the Advancement of Science
Ideology and intuition sometimes appear to be trumping science. So people deny the evidence even as it increases. I fear that the pace at which the public understands that the climate is changing, and puts pressure on the political system, will be too slow.
We are seeing that communicating scientific knowledge has had an effect, and that makes me happy! The deniers have less and less credibility as the public understands the scientific consensus more and more.
NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON, Director, Hayden Planetarium
I find that to worry about things is to invest emotional energy in ways that do not lead to change. Always better to do something about a problem than to worry about it.
What I expect will happen in the coming decades is that beachfront real estate, some of the most expensive in the housing marketplace, will become overrun by storm surges with enough frequency that it will force the wealthiest class (who might have previously been in denial of the phenomenon) to recognize the problem and take action, actions they can take since they are typically captains of industry and are in power and in control.
JERRY BROWN, Governor of California 
A huge challenge of climate change lies in the fact that for its solution, countries all over the world must collaborate in ways that are entirely unprecedented.
Each nation-state has to be fully engaged and take decisive steps outside the conventional economic comfort zone. And that requires more statesmanship that is currently in evidence in any of those countries. The mythology of the market and economistic view of life has to be transcended so people understand that a decent and sustainable quality of life requires a very different philosophy than the one that governs contemporary societies.
Here in California, we’re leading the nation in the economic recovery and the creation of jobs, and we are pioneering climate change strategies across a broad front. We have a robust cap-and-trade system. We have a goal of one-third renewable energy in the electricity sector; we’re already at 22 percent. We have the strictest building standards in the world. We have a goal of over a million electric vehicles; we’ve got our first 100,000! We have a certain momentum in California. There are other states where this is also true.
JAMES E. HANSEN, Climate scientist, emeritus director at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies 
The reason it’s a really dangerous situation is that the climate system does not respond quickly to the forces we apply to it. That means that we have not witnessed the impact of the gases we’ve already added to the atmosphere. We’re waiting for the public to see enough to demand effective government response.
The public doesn’t see that much yet, but there’s more in the pipeline. We are pumping energy into the ocean at a rapid rate; that energy is accumulating, and its biggest impact is going to be on ice shelves. The sea level will go up many meters. That means all coastal cities will be doomed if we stay on fossil fuel business as usual.
The upside is that the only policy that will work is making the price of fossil fuels match their cost. We have an organization determined to focus on exactly that issue: the Citizens Climate Lobby. It’s growing rapidly. Things are changing. But not fast enough.
MARIO J. MOLINA, Co-recipient of the 1995 Nobel Prize for his research on the chemistry of the ozone layer
What worries me most is the irrationality of certain interest groups preventing society from addressing the problem. Republicans in Congress are preventing action on an efficient solution such as a carbon tax.
There is a solution at hand. It doesn’t cost as much as the deniers claim. The Montreal Protocol [on ozone depletion] showed that you could solve such global problems. It would have been much more expensive not to solve it.
ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Author of “The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History”
For the last 10,000 years or so, the climate’s been relatively stable. But if you start imagining a world with a constantly changing climate, one where, say, rainfall patterns shift dramatically every few decades, then you begin to realize how dependent we all are on that stability. And the world we’re creating is that constantly changing one.
So I worry about just about everything, starting with the basics. There are 7.2 billion people on the planet right now, and we all need to eat.
Hopefulness or a lack of it is really not the issue here. We’ve already caused a lot of damage; there’s a lot of warming that’s in effect baked into the system. We’re capable of causing a great deal more damage, and we’re also capable of limiting that damage. That’s the choice at this point, and we need to face up to that.
J. MARSHALL SHEPHERD, Former president, American Meteorological Society
It bothers me that people think there’s a big debate in science when there isn’t. Being concerned about climate change is not some whim. When I go to the mall or to Walmart, people ask, “Do you really believe in climate change?” That’s like asking, “Do you believe in gravity?” I mean, the science is clear.
What gives me optimism is that many of the people who question the science are of an older generation. The kids get it. When I go to my children’s Scout meetings or when I talk to students on campus, they get beyond the misinformation and politics.
THE REV. MITCHELL C. HESCOX, President, Evangelical Environmental Network
Climate change is the greatest moral challenge of our time because it impacts every single soul in the world. In the conservative Christian world in the United States, we’ve gotten caught up in political partisanship. I’d like to see climate change as a Christian issue and not a partisan issue.
We are the stewards of God’s creation. We believe that the earth’s creation belongs to God and that we are charged to care for it.
When we started this [network] five years ago, we had 15,000 people we regularly communicated with on this issue. Today it approaches 400,000. It means that we’re starting to overcome the partisan divide and the tide is slowly turning.
DIANA H. WALL, Director, School of Global Environmental Sustainability, Colorado State University
What keeps me up, the thing that really drives me nuts, is that the rate of change is so fast. I work in one of the most extreme ecosystems on Earth: the Antarctic Dry Valleys. It is the coldest, windiest, driest place on Earth. We’re seeing warming events and very sunny events there, and this is causing a change in the organisms I study. These species have adapted to the conditions there. We don’t know what the impact will be on them or us.
My students give me hope.
MARTIN REES, Astrophysicist, University of Cambridge
I have a lot more fears than hopes. One aspect that particularly troubles me is that economists tend to underprioritize efforts at mitigation of atmospheric carbon, because the really serious downside of inaction won’t be experienced until the 22nd century and beyond. If action is delayed, it may then be too late to avoid irreversible runaway changes.
We shouldn’t discriminate against our fellow humans on grounds of date of birth. The lifetime welfare of the newborn should rate as highly as that of the already middle-aged. Indeed, many philosophers would assign equal value to the rights of those not yet born.
For them, foreclosing the potentialities of all future generations would be so catastrophic that we should strive to reduce even the tiniest probability that this could happen.
CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN, Former governor of New Jersey and former administrator, Environmental Protection Agency
What keeps me up at night are people who talk in absolutes. It’s the people who say “humans cause it” or “people have no role in it,” full stop. Science is not exact and the truth is in between. By taking the extreme position, they give an opening to the other side, and then people stop listening.
What gives me hope is that there are signs that the American people are beginning to relate some of the frequent weather extremes to climate.
Since 1980 our economy has grown, our population has grown and our energy use has grown, and yet our overall pollution has gone down. We are perfectly capable of implementing environmental regulation without stopping economic growth.
BJORN LOMBORG, director, Climate Consensus Center
Global warming is real and a problem, but we need better, more effective solutions. What troubles me most is that we keep focusing on making old-fashioned promises to cut CO2 [even though] these promises have failed to curb emissions rises for more than 20 years.
Why don’t they work? Because cheap power is the foundation for economic growth. There is an almost one-to-one connection between G.D.P. growth and CO2 growth, and few voters want to get poorer; in the developing world they want to get much richer.
Instead we pretend the solution is more heavily subsidized wind and solar. Right now, the world pays more than $60 billion a year in subsidies and gets less than 0.6 percent of energy from solar and wind. Even very optimistically, the International Energy Agency estimates we’ll get just 3.5 percent by 2035, and they will still need subsidies of about $100 billion a year.
The simple truth is, as long as renewables are much more expensive than fossil fuels, we will pay a couple of hundred billions to make ourselves feel virtuous, but we won’t make a real difference on the climate. And renewables aren’t “already competitive”: If they were, they wouldn’t need subsidies. Look at Spain: With lower but still substantial wind subsidies, Spain has put up just one wind turbine.
More and more countries are realizing we need a smarter approach. The solution is not pushing currently inefficient green technology, but to innovate down the price of future green energy. It makes me hopeful that Japan has now committed more than 20 percent of what is needed to effectively make a long-term difference on climate.
KATHARINE HAYHOE, Director, Climate Science Center, Texas Tech University
What troubles me as a scientist is the potential for vicious feedbacks within the climate system. The warming that we cause through all the carbon we produce could cause a series of cascading impacts that could lead to a much greater warming. The more carbon we produce, the higher the likelihood of these unpredictable risks.
What makes me hopeful are people. I’ve been working with cities, states and regional transportation councils, and none of them have to be convinced of the reality of this problem. I was sitting next to an assistant city manager for Dallas, a town not known for being green, and she blew me away with her list of amazing things Dallas has done to save energy. People are preparing for change.
MARGARET ATWOOD, Poet and novelist, author of “The Year of the Flood”
The most worrisome thing is the potential death of the ocean. If it dies, we die.
What gives me hope is that more and more people are aware of the dangers we face, and many smart people are at work on solutions. Our smart brains got us into this. Let’s see if they can get us out.
FREEMAN J. DYSON, Theoretical physicist, Institute for Advanced Study 
What worries me is that many people, including scientists and politicians, believe a whole lot of dogmatic nonsense about climate change. The nonsense says that climate change is a terrible danger and that it is something we could do something about if we wanted to. The whole point is to scare people, and this has been done very successfully.
Climate has always been changing, and climate has always been lousy. It has always been a background to existence that on the whole we’ve learned to cope with pretty well. What I feel happy about is that there are a lot of ordinary people with common sense who don’t believe the nonsense.
MARLENE MOSES, Nauru’s ambassador to the United Nations, chairwoman of the Alliance of Small Island States 
When I go home and look at the deteriorating situation there — increased droughts, the ocean washing away the coast — I can’t help but be fearful for what the future may hold for Nauru’s children and grandchildren. How will they adapt? Will the international community be there for them? These are most distressing questions to which I don’t yet have answers.
GLORIA STEINEM, Co-founder and former editor, Ms. Magazine 
Thinking about climate change used to give me images of the sun burning down and icebergs melting — horrific, but also impersonal and far away. Now I have intimate fears of storms and floods that drive us off this island of Manhattan, and fires that send thousands fleeing — in other words, just an acceleration of what we’re already seeing.
Like millions of others in public opinion polls, I’m willing to lower my standard of living to help create a turning point. We’re waiting for a practical, coordinated, understandable set of instructions that counters the Kochs, the deniers, the profiteers. Meanwhile, we try to do whatever we can.
Somehow, I find comfort in the idea that the earth is a living organism with a will of its own. The global women’s movement gives me hope because women are trying to take control of their own bodies and reproduction, which is even more basic than production. Everything we know says that when women can decide whether and when to have children, growth slows down to a little over replacement level. And that would be the single biggest long-term relief for the environment.
MARY ROBINSON, Former president of Ireland, former United Nations High Commissioner for human rights
I’m a grandmother with five grandchildren. What will they say about what we did or didn’t do?

Do you think it's possible for the next president to stop climate change?
Climate change has become an increasingly important concern for voters, so we wanted to ask candidates about it in a way that would capture their level of focus on the issue. Every candidate stressed the importance of addressing climate, but some -- like Jay Inslee and Cory Booker -- were more optimistic than others. 
  PETE BUTTIGIEG
  IT'S POSSIBLE FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT TO REVERSE THE TRAJECTORY TOWARD CLIMATE RUIN THAT WE'RE ON TODAY. Can he do it in four years? Of course not. But that's exactly why we need to act with the most urgency ever. This is a genera - tional project. It's going to have to be a national project. A good president will not only imple - ment policies, but set the tone so that the public, and private, and social, and academic sectors of this country are all pulling in the same direction, and leading the world to do the same.
  TIM RYAN
  I do. Yes. We have to marshal every aspect of our society, our government, our free enterprise system, our educa - tional institutions, our venture capital. All has to be point - ing in the direction of reversing climate change. I think if we do it right, if we engage the free enterprise system, if we align the environmental incentives with the financial incentives, that we can actually do it a lot quicker than most people think.
  CORY BOOKER
  IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ONE PERSON IN ONE OFFICE -- IT HAS TO BE A MOVEMENT, A RENEWED COMMITMENT IN OUR COUNTRY AND ACROSS THIS PLANET.
  BILL DE BLASIO
  THE NEXT PRESIDENT HAS TO TAKE THE LEAD IN STOPPING CLIMATE CHANGE AND YES, I THINK IT CAN BE DONE, BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT APPROACH. My city went through pain, so much suffering because of Hurricane Sandy. Dozens of people were lost in Hurricane Sandy. Billions of dollars of dam - age. I always say after Hurricane Sandy, there's not a lot of climate deniers left in New York City. It's clear to me the federal government has to lead the way with the Green New Deal. With the kinds of things we're doing in New York City, right now, we're moving our government car fleet to electric vehicles, we're putting up electric charging stations all over the city. We're mandating that buildings have to be energy efficient. If not, we're going to fine them. We're divesting from fossil fuels. Five billion dollars in divestment from fossil fuels. We're making sure that money is put into renewable energy investments. These are the kinds of things that should be happening on a vast scale with our federal gov - ernment. The United Nations says we have 12 years to start to fix things. I believe that's a real timeline we have to honor. We can do it if we take the full force of the federal government and devote it to the Green New Deal.
  MICHAEL BENNET
  I THINK WE, AS A COUNTRY, LEADING THE WORLD, NEED TO STOP CLIMATE CHANGE.
  MARIANNE WILLIAMSON
  Climate change is the greatest moral challenge of our generation. We have 12 years, according to most scientists, we have 12 years. If we do not act in very fundamental and very significant ways, we will cause irreparable harm to our ecosystem. So the next president of the United States needs to be someone who understands that, and who gives it the priority that it needs to have as this kind of an emergency, this kind of an ur - gency, not only for this country, but for the planet. We need a world-class en - vironmentalist at the head of the E.P.A.
  JAY INSLEE
  I believe that if we have a president with a vision for a clean energy economy, we will not only defeat climate change, but we will build a clean energy economy with eight million jobs. I'm the candidate with a plan that says it has to be job number one, and I'm the candidate with a plan to put eight million people to work. And as a governor I've seen our abil - ity to do this in Washington State where we have the best laws in the country. Yes, not only can we defeat climate change, it is the only option. Victory is the only option against climate change, because without victory there is not survival.
  SETH MOULTON
  We've got to address climate change and we've got to be ag - gressive in doing it. I don't know if one president is going to be able to do it, but I think it's incumbent on us to try. We have got to leave a livable planet for our kids and grandkids and we are not do - ing that right now. So, is it possible for one person to turn this around? Yes. Is it possible to fix it in the term of one presidency? Proba - bly not, but we can get started in the right direction.
  KAMALA HARRIS
  THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT HAS WITHIN HER CAPACITY THE ABILITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, and to help encourage human behaviors that are not contribut - ing to climate change. We have seen that where there has been leadership on this issue that we can see results. And this has got to be something where there is leadership at the top that re - flects the priorities of people across the country. I speak with farmers, I speak with people who are successful in business, I speak with students, I speak with grandparents and parents. Everyone knows that this is a real issue. And the fact that we have supposed leadership who is pushing science fiction instead of science fact will be to our collec - tive peril.
  JOHN DELANEY
  IF WE WAIT ANOTHER FIVE OR 10 YEARS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE, WE'VE CREATED A SITUATION THAT IS GOING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT FOR US TO GET OUT OF. I think the candidates running for president should be able to tell the Amer - ican people is how are they going to get something done on climate? I be - lieve I can. I believe I can get a carbon tax bill passed in my first year of president, put a price on carbon, take all that money and give it back to the American people in a dividend. I introduced that proposal in the Congress of the United States and it was bipartisan. I believe in my first year as presi - dent, I can get that passed with all the Democrats and with the Republicans who live in coastal states. Their citizens and their constituents are demand - ing they do something on climate. That will slow climate change down. It won't stop it. To stop it, we fundamentally need innovation, which is why I'm calling for a fivefold increase in the Department of Energy research budget because we need to innovate new storage technologies, new energy transmission technologies.
  AMY KLOBUCHAR
  YOU CAN'T STOP CLIMATE CHANGE, BUT YOU CAN RESPOND TO THIS CRISIS IN A MEANINGFUL WAY THAT WILL REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES. Right now, this president has done nothing. He is taking us backwards, and I believe that a voice from the heartland is important here because on the coast we know we have rising sea levels. We've seen the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, but it's im - portant to talk about what's going on right now in the middle of the coun - try. We've seen raging wildfires. We've seen firefighters die. We've seen tornadoes like we've never seen before. We've seen hail the size we couldn't imagine in places spontaneously all over this country. I've seen a woman named Fran in Iowa near the Nebraska border who shows me her house submerged in water that she bought with her husband for their two 4-year-olds, thought she'd live there forever. So there's horse hair in the plaster be - cause it's a century old, and I said to her, ''Well, is this water? You built this house or you bought this house right by the river?'' She said, ''No. The river is two and a half miles away. The water has just never come this far before.'' That's what's happening in the Midwest. So to me, the argument is, one, we can't af - ford not to do anything. What do we do? We get back in the international climate change agreement, immedi - ately. I do that on Day 1 as president. We bring back the clean power rules that are on the cutting room floor. We reduce greenhouse gases by put - ting the gas mileage standards back in place that President Trump with - drew, and we pass sweeping legisla - tion so we move forward on climate change. It is not happening 100 years from now. The climate crisis is happening now.
  ERIC SWALWELL
  It is possible for the next president to re - verse the devastating effects that climate chaos has caused in our country. First and foremost, I would host, in the United States, a climate summit. The Paris Agreement will have expired, as far as our ability to get into it, but I would host, in the U.S., a summit, put us back into it and then invest in greening the grid. Solar, wind, fusion, alternative fuel cells, and storage.
  BERNIE SANDERS
  NOT ALONE, AND NOT, CERTAINLY, JUST BY DOING WHAT HAS TO BE DONE IN THE UNITED STATES. Climate change by definition is a global crisis. And instead of hav - ing somebody in the White House who refuses to even acknowl - edge the reality of the problem, we need a president who is go - ing to reach out to every coun - try on earth and make it clear that this is a global issue and we have got to go forward together. My dream, and I don't know that I can bring this around, but my dream is to convince countries around the world and instead of spending in total one and a half trillion dollars a year on weap - ons of destruction, that maybe we stand together against the common enemy and we invest in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel into sustain - able energy and energy efficien - cy. So, this is a global problem.
  STEVE BULLOCK
  I do think it's possible for the next president to finally take the steps to at least address cli - mate change. I mean, all of the scientists say we need to do this over three decades. What we've seen so far, though, is, first, to step back, I think even George H.W. Bush 30 years ago said, 'We'll actually, we'll take on the greenhouse effect with a White House effect,' meaning leadership will start from the top. And unfortunately because of the outside and the corrupting influences of dark money, Republi - cans can't even acknowl - edge that climate change is human-caused.
  ANDREW YANG
  Climate change is likely going to be with us and is going to accelerate in the years to come. We should be investing in ways to mitigate the worst effects, including billions of dollars in renewable infrastructure, a dividend of $1,000 a month for every American adult would make our popula - tion more resilient, more able to deal with the worst effects of climate change because when there's a natural disaster, we know it's the poor that get hit hardest. I don't believe that the president can put a halt to climate change, given that the United States only accounts for 15 percent of global emissions.
  KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND
  IT IS THE GREATEST THREAT TO HUMANITY THAT EXISTS. AND SO I THINK GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE SHOULD BE A MOON SHOT FOR THIS GENERATION.
  JULIÁN CASTRO
  Yes, I think it's possible for the next president to have a dramatic impact not only on how the United States combats climate change, but how the world does that. My first executive order, if I'm president, would be to recommit the United States to the Paris climate accord, so that we lead again on climate change. On top of that, I believe that we need to make massive investments in renewable energy, and in bringing down carbon emissions. I like the concept of a Green New Deal. I believe that we don't have to choose between protecting our planet and growing jobs and growing our economy. We can do both of those things. One person alone can't stop climate change, but this nation can lead. And it can get other nations around the world to be lead - ers. Doing that together, I'm confident that we can effectively combat climate change.
  JOHN HICKENLOOPER
  Yeah, absolutely. I think the next president is going to be the last person who has a chance to stop climate change when it will still matter. The questions are not just what to do in this country, but how to accelerate adoption of strong actions all around the world, be - cause it's got to be a global solution.
  BETO O'ROURKE
  NO ONE PERSON NOR ANY ONE POLITICAL PARTY WILL BE ABLE TO DO THIS ON THEIR OWN, IT'S GOING TO TAKE THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY. Our plan calls for net zero green - house gas emissions by the year 2050. It calls for America to be halfway there by 2030, a little more than a decade from where we are right now. Our admin - istration will use executive au - thority to stop any new oil or gas leases on federal lands, to en - sure that every dollar of federal procurement reflects the cost of climate change and pollution. Gives the opportunity to farm - ers, and those in rural Ameri - ca to lead on this issue as well. For example, paying farmers at a profit to plant cover crops to pull more carbon out of the air, and sequester more of it in the soil. If every single one of us, and every single part of the country does our part, then we can also take our rightful role on the world stage as the indispensable na - tion, convene the other powers of the planet to do their part as well, and halt the warming of this plan - et before it becomes so great that the droughts, the floods, the fires and the storms that we see today will pale in comparison for the generations that follow. We have 10 years within which to act, and I want to make sure that I do my part to make every single second count for as much as we can, to ensure that we do all that is pos - sible while time still remains.
  TULSI GABBARD
  I think it's important for us in this country, as well as leaders in the world, to take the bold, aggressive action that we need to address the climate crisis that's before us. The United States alone can't accomplish this.
  DO YOU SUPPORT OR OPPOSE THE DEATH PENALTY? Opposing capital punishment was once seen as a dangerous position in politics. Recently, it has become the consensus stance of the Democratic Party
  MICHAEL BENNET I oppose the death penalty because I think, in part, it's part of our broken system of mass incarceration that is not adminis - tered in a way that is equal, just or fair.
  CORY BOOKER This is something that I have been writing reports about since I was a kid in grade school, and I just do not believe in the dealth penalty.
  STEVE BULLOCK There are both significant eco - nomic and racial disparities when it comes to the death penalty, but I wouldn't take it off the table for the most extreme circumstances, like terrorism.
  PETE BUTTIGIEG I don't think it makes us safer, and the inequi - ties by which it's been applied in this country are extremely disturbing.
  JULIÁN CASTRO I believe that it's morally wrong to take somebody's life. More than that, that the death penalty has been used disproportion - ally against poor people, against communities of color.
  BILL DE BLASIO I don't believe in the death penalty. There's been too many times where we've found out, later on, that someone was innocent. And the government took away their life.
  JOHN DELANEY As someone who wants a more civil society and someone who wants a society that advances, as it relates to how we think about human life and human dignity, I don't see myself supporting the death penalty. I don't think it accomplishes anything, and I think we can do better than that.
  TULSI GABBARD Unfortunately we still have a broken criminal justice system that wrongly convicts innocent people, issuing them the death penalty. Even one of those wrong convic - tions, taking an innocent life, is wrong.
  KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND I oppose the death penalty. I think the way it is implemented in America today is racist, and I be - lieve our criminal justice system has serious issues with regard to institutional rac - ism that must be addressed.
  KAMALA HARRIS I'm person - ally opposed to the death penalty. I always have been. And for many good reasons, including how it has been applied, which has been to really do it in a way that has not been in favor of -- and has been against, actually -- people of color.
  JOHN HICKENLOOPER It's really in the modern world not workable.
  JAY INSLEE I've offered pardons to thou - sands of people in the state of Washington, for those who've been caught in the drug wars for misdemeanor convictions of marijuana. We need reformation of our judicial system to remove the long shadow of racial disparity in that system.
  AMY KLOBUCHAR I oppose the death penalty, and I have long held that view. I held that view when I was the chief prosecutor for Minnesota's largest county. I believe we need to reduce crime.
  SETH MOULTON One innocent person put to death is not worth it. So, I'm flat-out opposed. It's a moral issue for me.
  BETO O'ROURKE Neither the federal govern - ment nor the governments of the states should be in the process of taking the lives of our fellow Americans.
  TIM RYAN We have innocent people in the United States who have been killed by the state for crimes that they did not commit. Until that system is fixed, we should not be applying it to anybody, maybe save a terrorist that would go through a certain proceeding.
  BERNIE SANDERS The state should not be involved in murdering. You have people who've committed horrific crimes, people who are dangerous, people who should spend the rest of their lives behind bars, but I do not believe in capital punishment.
  ERIC SWALWELL For seven years, I worked as a prosecutor, and I sent some of the worst people away for life without a chance of parole. That's what I believe is the best sentence for anyone who carries out the worst crimes in our communi - ties, but I do not support the death penalty.
  ELIZABETH WARREN I oppose the death penalty. And I oppose it on two grounds. One is that we're not infallible as hu - man beings. We make mistakes. And, particularly, the evidence sug - gests that we make mistakes that are racially tinged. We can't do that as a country.
  MARIANNE WILLIAMSON I oppose the death penalty.
  ANDREW YANG It's incredibly cost - ly. We've made tragic errors in our past and likely will continue to do so, and our applica - tion of the death penalty is racist in many situations. And so, I would do away with the death penalty.

While BP and other European companies invest billions in renewable energy, Exxon and Chevron are committed to fossil fuels and betting on moonshots.
HOUSTON — As oil prices plunge and concerns about climate change grow, BP, Royal Dutch Shell and other European energy companies are selling off oil fields, planning a sharp reduction in emissions and investing billions in renewable energy.
The American oil giants Chevron and Exxon Mobil are going in a far different direction. They are doubling down on oil and natural gas and investing what amounts to pocket change in innovative climate-oriented efforts like small nuclear power plants and devices that suck carbon out of the air.
The disparity reflects the vast differences in how Europe and the United States are approaching climate change, a global threat that many scientists say is increasing the frequency and severity of disasters like wildfires and hurricanes. European leaders have made tackling climate change a top priority while President Trump has called it a “hoax” and has dismantled environmental regulations to encourage the exploitation of fossil fuels.
As world leaders struggle to adopt coordinated and effective climate policies, the choices made by oil companies, with their deep pockets, science prowess, experience in managing big engineering projects and lobbying muscle may be critical. What they do could help determine whether the world can meet the goals of the Paris agreement to limit the increase of global temperatures to below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels.
The big American and European oil and gas companies publicly agree that climate change is a threat and that they must play a role in the kind of energy transition the world last saw during the industrial revolution. But the urgency with which the companies are planning to transform their businesses could not be more different.
“Despite rising emissions and societal demand for climate action, U.S. oil majors are betting on a long-term future for oil and gas, while the European majors are gambling on a future as electricity providers,” said David Goldwyn, a top State Department energy official in the Obama administration. “The way the market reacts to their strategies and the 2020 election results will determine whether either strategy works.”
To environmentalists and even some Wall Street investors, the American oil giants are clearly making the wrong call. In August, for example, Storebrand Asset Management, Norway’s largest private money manager, divested from Exxon Mobil and Chevron. And Larry Fink, who leads the world’s largest investment manager, BlackRock, has called climate change “a defining factor in companies’ long-term prospects.”
European oil executives, by contrast, have said that the age of fossil fuels is dimming and that they are planning to leave many of their reserves buried forever. They also argue that they must protect their shareholders by preparing for a future in which governments enact tougher environmental policies.
BP is the standard-bearer for the hurry-up-and-change strategy. The company has announced that over the next decade it will increase investments in low-emission businesses tenfold, to $5 billion a year, while shrinking its oil and gas production by 40 percent. Royal Dutch Shell, Eni of Italy, Total of France, Repsol of Spain and Equinor of Norway have set similar targets. Several of those companies have cut their dividends to invest in new energy.
BP tried a transition in the late 1990s and early 2000s under the leadership of John Browne, then chief executive, but financial results from renewables were disappointing, and the company eventually dropped its moniker “Beyond Petroleum.”
In an interview, Mr. Browne said this time would be different. “There are many more voices now,” he said, adding that the Paris agreement was a watershed, that the economics of renewables have improved and that investor pressure was building.
This month, BP and Equinor announced a partnership to build and operate wind projects along the coasts of New York and Massachusetts. The governors of those states want to reduce their reliance on natural gas, which this effort will aid.
American oil executives say it would be folly for them to switch to renewables, arguing that it is a low-profit business that utilities and alternative energy companies can pursue more effectively. They say it is only a matter of time before oil and gas prices recover as the pandemic recedes.
For now, Exxon and Chevron are sticking to what they know best, shale drilling in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, deepwater offshore production and trading natural gas. In fact, Chevron is acquiring a smaller oil company, Noble Energy, to increase its reserves.
“Our strategy is not to follow the Europeans,” said Daniel Droog, Chevron’s vice president for energy transition. “Our strategy is to decarbonize our existing assets in the most cost-effective way and consistently bring in new technology and new forms of energy. But we’re not asking our investors to sacrifice return or go forward with three decades of uncertainty on dividends.”
Chevron says it is increasing its own use of renewable energy to power its operations. It also says it is reducing emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. And the company has invested more than $1.1 billion in various projects to capture and sequester carbon so it isn’t released into the atmosphere.
Its venture capital arm, Chevron Technology Ventures, is investing in new-energy start-ups like Zap Energy, which is developing modular fusion nuclear reactors that release no greenhouse gases and limit radioactive waste. Another, Carbon Engineering, removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to convert into fuel.
All told, Chevron Technology Ventures has two funds with a total of $200 million, about 1 percent of the company’s capital and exploration budget last year. The company has a separate $100 million fund to support a $1 billion investment consortium that aims to reduce emissions across the oil and gas industry.
“We need breakthrough technology, and my job is to go find it,” said Barbara Burger, president of Chevron Technology Ventures, which employs 60 of Chevron’s 44,000 employees. “The transition is not an 11:59-on-Tuesday event. It’s going to be gradual, and evolving and continual over decades.”
Exxon has also largely steered away from renewables and has instead invested in roughly one-third of the world’s limited carbon-capture capacity, which has been so expensive and energy intensive that few companies have been willing to underwrite large-scale projects.
It spends about $1 billion a year on research and development, much of which goes to developing new energy technologies and efficiency improvements that reduce emissions.
One project involves directing carbon emitted from industrial operations into a fuel cell that can generate power. That should reduce emissions while increasing energy production.
In a separate experiment, Exxon recently announced a “big advance” with scientists at University of California, Berkeley, and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for developing materials that help capture carbon dioxide from natural-gas power plants with less heating and cooling than previous methods.
The company is also working on strains of algae whose oils can produce biofuel for trucks and airplanes. The plants also absorb carbon through photosynthesis, which Exxon scientists are trying to speed up while producing more oil.
“Step 1, you have to do the science, and it is impossible to put a deadline on discovery,” said Vijay Swarup, Exxon’s vice president for research and development.
Research into fusion, algae and carbon capture has been going on for decades, and many climate experts say those technologies could take decades more to commercialize. That’s why many scholars and environmentalists feel the American oil companies are not serious about tackling climate change.
“Oil companies don’t do things that put themselves out of business,” said David Keith, a Harvard professor of applied physics who founded Carbon Engineering. “That is not the way the world works.”
But some energy analysts argue that the American oil companies are right not to rush to change their businesses. They argue that U.S. lawmakers have simply not given them enough incentives to make a radical break.
“If this is the sunset time for oil and gas, someone forgot to tell consumers,” said Raoul LeBlanc, a vice president at IHS Markit, a research and consulting firm. He said that while sales of electric cars may have picked up, it would take decades to replace the more than a billion internal-combustion cars on the road now.
It will probably take just as long, if not longer, to replace the large fleets of trucks, airplanes and ships that run on fossil fuels. There ought to be enough demand for oil over the next 30 to 40 years for Exxon and Chevron to exploit their reserves and make money, though the profits will decline over time, said Dieter Helm, an Oxford economist who studies energy policy.
“Investors can invest in Tesla or any renewable or electric company,” he said. “Why should an oil firm with the skills for large-scale hydrocarbon developments be able to compete against these new players?”
But Mr. Helm, who published the book “Burn Out: The End Game for Fossil Fuels” in 2017, said he believed that all oil companies had a dim future beyond the next few decades because technology advances would make them obsolete in a world economy dominated by electricity, battery storage, three-dimensional printing, robotics and other breakthroughs. “These companies, in the end, will die.”

Environmentalists
Turned Into Voters   Nathaniel Stinnett
  Founder and executive director of the Environmental Voter Project
  Nathaniel Stinnett rarely talks about the environment; climate change even less.
  For the person who runs the Environmental Voter Project, that may sound surprising. To Mr. Stinnett, it's pretty obvious, even if it's difficult.
  However, convincing people that environmentalism is important or that climate change is happening isn't the point. The point is getting those who consider themselves environmentalists to vote -- nearly 16 million did not in the 2014 midterm elections.
  Mr. Stinnett, 43, realized if he could get environmentalists to vote, then they would show up in polls of likely voters, and so would their priorities -- the environment and climate change. Politicians would have to pay attention to them to get elected, and these issues would come into the national conversation.
  So, with a baby on the way, Mr. Stinnett made the difficult decision to leave a high-paying job at a Boston law firm and take on the cause.
  But how? Most people buy into the idea that voting is good (even if they don't do it) and would be ashamed for their communities to find out they didn't vote.
  Mr. Stinnett said he and his colleagues used social and peer pressure -- much better ''behavioral nudges'' than talking about the environment. A sample mailer from the group: ''Did you know that last time there was a City Council election, 87 percent of your block voted and you didn't?''
  And it's working. Since starting in Massachusetts in 2015, a report by the group shows that it has increased turnout in multiple elections by around 5 percent; in its first attempt in Florida (St. Petersburg's mayoral race), the group added nearly 500 environmentalists to the voter rolls, and it plans to target nearly a million Florida voters in the coming midterm elections.
  For the midterms this year, with an army of 1,500 volunteers across the country, they'll be targeting 2.4 million environmentalists in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Colorado, Florida and Nevada.
  It might seem depressing that so many environmentalists (let alone Americans) don't vote. But Mr. Stinnett sees it as an ''enormous opportunity.''
  ''We have a silent green majority,'' he said. ''We've already won the battle for hearts and minds, and we have this army that could change everything by doing one thing: voting.''
  Becoming an Activist For Environmental Justice
  Elizabeth Yeampierre
  Executive director of Uprose
  Elizabeth Yeampierre, a native New Yorker of Puerto Rican heritage, did not plan on being an environmental justice activist.
  When she became the leader of Uprose, a Latino community-based organization in Brooklyn, she began by listening to what the community wanted: clean air; more green space; no new power plants in their neighborhood.
  In the process of fighting for these things and others, Ms. Yeampierre found herself at the helm of what has become one of the country's most successful community-based climate and environmental justice groups.
  From Sunset Park, Brooklyn, she quickly made an impact across the city -- advocating for lead paint removal legislation -- and the state -- helping to pass brownfields legislation -- and nationally -- speaking at a climate change rally, which coincided with Pope Francis's visit, on the National Mall in Washington.
  In the process, Ms. Yeampierre, who is descended from African and indigenous people, has helped change what climate activism looks like. She is making a space for young people of color, including at events like the People's Climate March.
  ''There are all these stereotypes about minorities not caring about climate change,'' she said, ''but we live within our carbon footprint, and we do care.''
  Cindy Weisner, the executive director of the Grassroots Global Justice Alliance, met Ms. Yeampierre as they were both helping to organize the People's Climate March, and was immediately impressed by her ability to connect the needs of her community to the wider environmental and climate justice movement.
  ''For her to extend out beyond the needs of her community was a real sign showing me personally: this is what leadership means,'' Ms. Weisner said.
  Ms. Yeampierre, who is in her 50s, said her success was deeply rooted in protest culture and community organizing, not some radical innovation: she listens, she shares.
  And she has perspective: ''Our ancestors were in shackles, and we're a testament to their sacrifice and their vision.
  ''Like them we need to be able to believe we can change things. There has never been a challenge to our survival like climate change,'' but that doesn't mean we give up, she said.
  ''I can't live thinking that I didn't do everything I could.''
  Finding a Solution For Plastic Pollution
  Boyan Slat
  Founder of The Ocean Cleanup
  Swirling in the eddies and currents of the Northern Pacific Ocean are trillions of pieces of plastic, stretching across an area about four times the size of California. It's a scourge that scientists lament, and one that captures the public imagination every so often, like when a photo of a sea horse wrapped around a Q-tip goes viral.
  The scope of the problem, like so many environmental issues, feels too big to do anything about to most people, including adults.
  Enter Boyan Slat. When he was 16, he went scuba diving in Greece, where he said he saw more plastic than fish. The problem of marine plastic pollution became one he wanted to solve.
  Within two years -- at the same time that he became a legal adult in his native Netherlands -- he had started a foundation, The Ocean Cleanup, and began developing a device to get plastic out of the ocean.
  Now 23, he is getting ready to deploy his invention to the North Pacific Garbage Patch, where this summer it will begin gathering plastic, which will be taken by barge to land where it will be recycled. The hope is that half of the plastic there will be gone within five years.
  Despite his efforts to solve a major environmental problem -- he plans to collect the plastic in the four other accumulation zones in the South Pacific, North and South Atlantic and Indian Oceans -- he considers himself a technologist, not an environmentalist. For Mr. Slat, marine plastic pollution was something he thought he could fix, through his passion for invention and technology.
  ''I hope that the Ocean Cleanup can be a blueprint of how you can solve problems,'' he said. ''Instead of fighting against the stuff you don't agree with, building the future that you do agree with.''
  Carbon Dioxide Emissions Become Fuels and Materials
  Kendra Kuhl
  Co-founder of Opus 12
  Imagine a future where car engines run on particles gathered from the fuel they've already burned and where plastic doesn't sit in landfills forever, but has another life -- as plastic.
  That's the future dreamed up by Kendra Kuhl and her co-founders of Opus 12, a clean energy start-up that seeks to turn carbon dioxide emissions into new fuels and materials similar to plastic. And they are in the process of creating it.
  Through a complicated process that is hard for a journalist with no background in chemical engineering to explain, carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes are combined with water and a catalyst in a reactor. When (renewably powered) electricity is applied to the reactor, it can produce fuel or plastics.
  Dr. Kuhl and her colleagues are working on creating a commercial-scale prototype, but they hope someday to be able to recycle tons of carbon dioxide emissions every day, preventing additional planet-warming emissions and finding a beneficial use for the gas we have released in such abundance.
  Dr. Kuhl, 36, majored in chemistry as an undergraduate at Stanford University and later earned her doctorate in the subject. She was drawn to the field partly because of her talent for it and partly because she wanted to do something about climate change, inspired by her love of the outdoors that came from growing up in Montana.
  Ilan Gur, the founding director of Cyclotron Road, a fellowship program that supports scientists trying to build technologies with global impact, selected Dr. Kuhl and her co-founder, Etosha Cave, for their first class of fellows because of their unique application of hard science to the world's biggest challenge.
  ''I'm not one to use hyperbole lightly,'' Mr. Gur said, ''but what she's working on could be part of a solution that potentially saves the planet.''
  Ms. Kuhl is slightly more modest: ''Naïvely when I was in high school, I thought, 'We can make a new technology that can solve this whole problem.' The deeper into it I've gotten the more I've realized that a new technology can help, but it takes all kinds of things together to make a difference.''
  A Public DefenderOf Climate Sciences
  Kim Cobb
  Professor of atmospheric and climate sciences at Georgia Institute of Technology
  When Kim Cobb, looks at a coral reef, she sees something others might miss: thousands of years of climate history.
  She has been researching on Christmas Island in the Central Pacific for more than two decades, and has been able to reconstruct how El Niño has behaved for the last 7,000 years.
  Because of her work, scientists can say with greater confidence that El Niño has become more intense as a result of human activity.
  And she has seen its effects firsthand. When she visited her research site after the 2015-16 El Niño, she saw a skeleton of the reef More than 75 percent was dead.
  ''You can't witness what I did at my research site of 20-plus years, watch it die and in the same year watch an administration get elected that is openly hostile to climate change and climate policy and not be changed by those events,'' she said.
  Since then, Dr. Cobb, 43, has become more than an award-winning climate scientist -- she has become a public defender of climate scientists, their work and the planet.
  On Twitter (@coralsncaves), at the March for Science Atlanta last year, and in all her public appearances, she presses for engagement -- demanding that audiences live their values; challenging scientists to focus on solutions, not just on identifying problems; encouraging her students to reduce their carbon footprints.
  Being a mother of four has also made her more radical. Climate change is even more urgent because of them, she said, and her experience ''narrowly escaping'' the professional damage so many mothers endure made her want to advance the careers of other women in climate science and science more generally. She has the opportunity to do that as an Advance professor of diversity, equity and inclusion at Georgia Tech.
  For Dr. Cobb, climate change and diversity in science are connected. They both require engagement and solutions, and plenty of voices and ideas.
  ''The medicine of engagement keeps me going personally in what are deep structural long-term challenges that I know I can't fix alone,'' she said.

And she has seen its effects firsthand. When she visited her research site after the 2015-16 El Niño, she saw a skeleton of the reef. More than 75 percent was dead.
“You can’t witness what I did at my research site of 20-plus years, watch it die and in the same year watch an administration get elected that is openly hostile to climate change and climate policy and not be changed by those events,” she said.
Since then, Dr. Cobb, 43, has become more than an award-winning climate scientist — she has become a public defender of climate scientists, their work and the planet.
On Twitter (@coralsncaves), at the            March for Science Atlanta last year, and in all her public appearances, she presses for engagement — demanding that audiences live their values; challenging scientists to focus on solutions, not just on identifying problems; encouraging her students to reduce their carbon footprints.
Being a mother of four has also made her more radical. Climate change is even more urgent because of them, she said, and her experience “narrowly escaping” the professional damage so many mothers endure made her want to advance the careers of other women in climate science and science more generally. She has the opportunity to do that as an Advance professor of diversity, equity and inclusion at Georgia Tech.
For Dr. Cobb, climate change and diversity in science are connected. They both require engagement and solutions, and plenty of voices and ideas.
“The medicine of engagement keeps me going personally in what are deep structural long-term challenges that I know I can’t fix alone,” she said.
How We Picked Our Visionaries
People love lists.
We want to check out the best places to travel, catch up with the best inventions of the last 100 years, be in the know about the best-dressed people, the best books, the best schools. And on and on.
Of course, there is a risk to listmaking. Maybe your choices won’t hold up over the years. Maybe the best book of decades ago seems not so great today.
With the listmaking fervor and its risks in mind, we searched for people who would fit our criteria for visionaries. They had to be people who are forward-looking, working on exciting projects, helping others or taking a new direction. We wanted diversity in gender, race and ethnic background.
We assigned writers who are knowledgeable about the subjects we deemed most important. And we limited the list to 30.
Narrowing down the numbers was a huge challenge. And that’s a good problem to have. It means there are a lot of people out there who are following their visions.
We hope this inspires you to follow yours.

Here's a "Your Dot" contribution on the many benefits of managing fires in forests, savannah and peatlands - including slowing global warming, protecting threatened ecosystems and reducing noxious palls of haze. It comes from Lindon N. Pronto, a young            former federal wildland firefighter from California who is completing a master of science degree in            environmental governance at the University of Freiburg in Germany. Pronto also works at the            Global Fire Monitoring Center at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in that city. He's in Pyeongchang, South Korea, this week at the            Sixth International Wildland Fire Conference.
One strategy with implications for climate-treaty talks, he writes, is using controlled fires to cut chances of more intense blazes that emit far more short-term greenhouse gases and degrade ecosystems.
The piece is timely given how much uncontrolled fires have been in the news of late, from the American West to            Indonesia, where            President Joko Widodo just            expressed regret to Malaysia over the resulting harmful haze. For more on that situation please read            Joe Cochrane's excellent report on the fires for The Times and watch            drone video shot by Greenpeace here. (This also happens to be the            International Day for Disaster Reduction.)
Here's Pronto's piece: 
 Fire Management, Pollution and Climate

 By Lindon Pronto

When raging wildfires make the news in the United States, viewers most often watch 100-foot flame fronts threatening luxury homes in Southern Californian or log cabins nestled in the forested Pacific Northwest. Fires have been largely excluded from the climate change discussions, but fortunately this is changing to include consideration of fire as both a consequence and driver of climate change.
In the tropics, fire has been used to manage and tame landscapes through most of human history. But the scale of burning, particularly in Indonesia, has made fire's environmental impacts an international issue, both by sending dangerous haze across borders and adding to the global buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases warming the climate.
Recent drone footage shot by Greenpeace in Indonesia shows devastation on an astounding scale - combusted rain forest and peatlands smoldering to the horizon. Unfortunately, this is not new.
With a much-anticipated round of climate treaty negotiations starting in Paris on Nov. 30, scientists and fire management specialists are strongly considering  the gains in integrating improved fire management practices into climate related agreements and policies. This is a central focus at            the International Wildland Fire Conference this week.
Here's why this could help slow global warming. Global vegetation fire emissions typically constitute a third of total releases of carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping emission, annually (1). For example, fires burning in Indonesia alone during the potent El Niño event in 1997 and 1998 produced the equivalent of up to 40 percent of the global gross carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels for that year (2).
This dry season is shaping up to be on track, or worse.
Additionally, every year an average of 608 million hectares burn (over 1.5 billion acres) (3) while an estimated annual average of 339,000 people die prematurely from ailments linked to vegetation fire smoke, with 110,000 of those deaths occurring in Southeast Asia. During previous El Niño years like this one, that global average spiked to some 530,000 deaths (4).
Worldwide, vegetation fires are showing a trend toward longer burning periods, increased fire severity, larger areas burned and increased (mostly human caused) frequency - with all of these factors contributing to more damaging environmental impacts, higher shares of emissions and increasing socioeconomic costs, including greater threats to human health and security.
Scientists are warning that amplifying positive feedbacks appear to be developing in sensitive areas. These ecosystems, primarily the Arctic tundra (5), peatlands (1), and tropical rain forests (6, 7, 8), harbor ancient, highly-concentrated carbon stocks, which are rapidly released during fire events like the one in Indonesia.
During last year's round of climate treaty talks, in Lima, Peru, a            statement issued by the            Global Fire Monitoring Center underscored the need to address global vegetation fires in the context of climate change, referring to the work of 58 scientists who evaluated the global state of fire between 1993 and 2014. The full findings are in a 400-page            white paper commissioned by the            United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction.
Teams are also assessing ways to improve understanding and management of fire's impacts on the terrestrial environment, on human populations and infrastructure and on the atmosphere - including from cross-border smoke or radioactive fallout from contaminated areas consumed by fire (9).
One tangible result is an agreement of the            Association of Southeast Asian Nations to combat trans-boundary haze from fires. Other efforts include the            International Wildfire Preparedness Mechanism, the            International Fire Aviation Working Group, the            EuroFire project, the spreading standardization of            incident command procedures, the            GOFC-GOLD fire monitoring and mapping program, and numerous regional and bilateral agreements.
The next logical step would be a coherent global fire strategy. ASEAN aside, no formal commitments have been made for international disaster preparedness and responses related to large vegetation fires. Flexible yet concerted strategies combining regulatory, informational, economic and organizational instruments, should consider local to global arrangements.
A scientifically-informed cooperative strategy for managing vegetation fires with the climate in mind might help defuse tensions between rich and poor nations tussling over provisions in the draft climate agreement on climate aid and emissions cuts.
Policy approaches could support and include:
- Knowledge transfer and capacity building
- Early fire detection, warning and monitoring systems
- Distinguishing between constructive and destructive fire
- Increased application of prescribed fire in appropriate ecosystems
- Reviewing regional and national policies and law enforcement effectiveness
- Embracing innovation and creativity, along with science and technology
- Using existing institutions; creating new ones where needed
- Applying community based fire management and incorporating indigenous knowledge
- Searching for alternatives to fire in land-use change
- Enhancing trans-boundary cooperation, exchanges, and protocols
- Addressing fire-induced immediate threats to human health and security
Many of these objectives are already under consideration, development or implementation, making it conceivable that they can be shaped into a more comprehensive program. Fire occurrence and fire landscapes, unlike other environmental disturbances, can be effectively managed to result in landscapes that either welcome, or discourage, subsequent fires and can offer a comparatively low-cost means of curbing greenhouse-gas emissions in the short and medium term. Local communities play a critical role in such a strategy.
As the esteemed fire historian Stephen Pyne puts it, we must address the bigger problem, Man's burning of neolithic landscapes-more commonly referred to as fossil fuels.
In the end, we must address the bigger problem, emissions from burning fossil fuels.
But replacing fossil fuels with renewables at a global scale will take time. While the heavily touted "solutions" are things like incrementally more fuel-efficient vehicles, more sustainable consumption and waste reduction, we could conceivably look to improving wildfire management to buy some time while we sort out the fossil fuel challenge.
Simply put, fire must be carefully applied and delicately managed in natural fire landscapes, and appropriately excluded from where it does not belong.

 Dominick A. DellaSala, the president and chief scientist of Geos Institute, an organization helping communities prepare for climate change, sent an email criticizing several points in Lindon Pronto's post. Here's the email and a response from Pronto.
DellaSala:
As author and co-editor of a new fire book, "The Ecological Importance of Mixed-Severity Fires - Nature's Phoenix," I would like to comment on Lindon's hypothesis that by "controlling" fire we can reduce climate change impacts. Lindon's assumption respectfully misses the science mark in several ways. First, despite billions of dollars spent in the US each year on fire suppression, the US Forest Service cannot possibly control all fires and shouldn't try as its impossible to do so. The 2% of fires that escape containment do so during extreme weather conditions - drought, high winds, high temperatures that overwhelm fire suppression forces and that are responsible for 97% of the burn acres each year - they simply cannot and should not be fought under extreme conditions as its not only inappropriate ecologically its not fiscally responsible and risky.
As climate change results in more extremes, fire "control" becomes even less realistic as climate, not fuels, is mainly driving the really big fires that Lindon would like to contain. Second, the ecosystem impacts of increased fire suppression would be substantial as many ecosystems depend on large fires, even severe fire patches to maintain ecosystem health (based on numerous fire ecology studies globally). Collateral ecosystem damage would do more harm than good. Third, even if "control" were possible, which it is not during big fires, prescribed fire will not reduce fire intensity in big fire years (again because of extreme weather as the driver) so global fire containment is is completely unrealistic. Fourth, most fires, even severe ones emit only 15-30% of their carbon as CO2 (several peer reviewed studies). After fire, the dead trees act as long-term carbon sinks and new vegetation rapidly sequesters carbon from the atmosphere. Most carbon life cycle analysis, using published computer simulations, show that the emissions given off by trying to contain fire actually exceed those from the fire itself given in order to influence fire behavior fossil fuels are used to drive logging trucks, operate machinery, air tankers, and transport wood products, including biomass to fuels.
Finally, deforestation by far is the biggest problems with forest fires today especially in the tropics. These are the truly unnatural fires as tropical wet forests (and peat fires too) are not supposed to burn but do so because of unsustainable land-uses. Delegates to the Paris climate summit need to focus on causal agents by reducing the biggest problems first and foremost - fossil fuel emissions and deforestation. While Lindon's intention to reduce emissions is certainly necessary, it's misplaced on fire. Just like we can't control the weather, there is no way possible for controlling large fire events given under a changing climate extremes are the new norm.
Linton:
1. Fire is more than a symptom, it's a means, it's a tool. He is correct to put the finger on deforestation (or more correctly land-use change), however one cannot brush aside the role of fire. The reason fire is used as a tool is because its cheap, can be abused with certain intended outcomes. Lets put it this way, without fire, would MNCs or local interests have the resources or the capacity (or would it be cost effective?) to clear such large areas? How would they kill all the trees? Remove all the slash? Fertilize the ground? A deliberate human activity is not a "symptom"; it's part of a root cause.
2. "Controlled" fire is purposely not mentioned in my piece, though I did not comment on it during your introduction as technically it is "one" all-embracing way to use fire: in a generally controlled manner. Dominick makes a rather moot point here, because no one in the fire management community is suggesting to upset fire return intervals, or altering fire regime impacts in terms of the host ecosystem sensitivity. However, smarter fire management could include at historical fire regimes and potentially use fire to restoreecosystems to a previous state (e.g. before detriments caused by fire exclusion or invasive species). Basically that is the whole idea behind prescribed burning across the US and elsewhere. Fire where it was naturally occurring became characterized as "bad" all over the world, with some exceptions most in some savannah ecosystems.
As for the severity of burning, that is one thing that we can "control" fairly well by using prescribed fire only under the right seasonality (see early summer burning in e.g. South Africa or Australia), the right local weather conditions, and through the correct methodology/application. Unless he is referring to non-fire adapted species - where of course one would not use fire as a tool... the whole point of excluding fire from many areas where it is currently being used.
3. As for emission releases - the critical question is over what amount of time! Some studies indicate that in fire-adapted ecosystems the short-term carbon release of fires and the long-term carbon release of decomposition, are pretty equal (the difference lies in some of the other compounds released by fire that tend to contribute more in the greenhouse effect). This is then balanced over time through sequestration during the regrowth period. This of course makes total sense in natures perfect design. Further studies indicate that prescribed fire in these ecosystems, overall are less damaging, and certainly emit less than short-term high severity events which in the West, are very visible effects of a long-time fire exclusion approach. This would tend to indicate that high mortality fires that we see now, are in fact degrading the ecosystem slowly - and prescribed fire as attempting to mimic a natural fire regimes is the human attempt at mitigating a human induced issue. It must be noted that the vast majority of fires are still human caused - supporting the notion that increased frequency and severity is likely very true. However, when it comes to the area burned, historical records indicate that even at a global scale, the reach of fire is less today. We do still largely emphasize suppression over fuels management.  It's where the money goes, and detrimentally the suppression budget swallows all the other budgets. We all know this has to be fixed, and some bills are attempting that.
We live in a reality where we must reconcile human activity with maintaining ecosystems. We cannot do this without integrated and even globally concerted efforts, or at best commonly agreed upon principles.
As for a price tag on integrated fire management, the American way of heavy equipment, diverse incendiary devices and lots of people with cans of 3:1 Diesel Gas mix is not realistic, or, as Dominick points out, cost effective. We are talking about "big-box" fire suppression to not control fires at their smallest point; we are talking about more let-burn and minimum impact suppression tactics (MIST); and most importantly for the rest of the world we are talking about community based fire management. Indigenous knowledge was used to appropriately manage fire and maintain ecosystem vitality (and the services that human livelihoods depended on) for millennia, and it was free. Scientists and the most advanced societies are quite literally turning their backs to this knowledge and these forms of fire management.
In the end, the only way to judge is to assess if overall the ecosystem is degraded (e.g., through greatly shortened fire intervals). Our ancestors knew this. The whole point is ecosystem degradation - in some cases the ecosystem is being degraded by excluding fire, and in other cases its being degraded by fire. A significant share of global emissions can be directly traced to mismanagement of fire. And most fire emissions are coming from places where fire should be minimal or absent.

Highlight: Human-caused climate change had an impact on Australia’s wildfires, a new attribution study confirms. The 30 percent figure they calculated is a minimum.

Confirming what had been widely suspected, researchers have found that human-caused climate change had an impact on Australia’s recent devastating wildfires, making the extremely high-risk conditions that led to widespread burning at least 30 percent more likely than in a world without global warming.
The researchers said the full influence of climate change on the fires was probably much greater, but that climate simulations, which form the basis of this type of study, underestimate trends in extreme heat in Australia compared with real-world observational data.
“We’re very sure that is a definite number we can scientifically defend,” said the lead author of the study, Geert Jan van Oldenborgh of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, referring to the 30 percent figure.
But the real influence of climate change on the recent fire season in Australia is greater, he added. “We think it is much larger than that, but we can’t prove that until we find out why there is this discrepancy between the observations and the climate models.”
The research is the latest in a growing subfield of climate science: attribution studies that look for links, or the lack of them, between climate change and specific weather-related events, often within weeks of an event. The studies usually compare models of current conditions to those of the world around 1900, before large-scale emissions of carbon dioxide and other planet-warming gases began.
The Australian study was conducted, like many others, by an international group of scientists called World Weather Attribution. It was made public on Wednesday before being peer reviewed and published in a scientific journal, but scientists with the group said it followed what are now well-established practices for such studies.
Record warmth and dryness last year led to a severe wildfire outbreak in Australia, with an estimated 50 million acres burned, including more than 16 million acres in the southeastern part of the country, which was most affected. All told, at least 34 people were killed and nearly 6,000 homes and other structures were destroyed.
Dr. van Oldenborgh said the study was the most complicated the group had ever conducted because wildfires are a complex phenomenon affected not only by heat and precipitation but also by wind, humidity and other factors.
The researchers looked at the influence of climate change using a measurement standard called the Fire Weather Index, which takes all those factors into account to determine the risk of wildfire in a specific area at a specific time. They calculated the index values across southeastern Australia during the peak burning period of December and January.
Those values were extremely high, and were 30 percent more likely to be that high now than before 1900. Put another way, the researchers said, such high values are about four times more likely now than they were before.
The study also separately analyzed the influence of climate change on the extreme heat that Australia experienced during the fire season, and on the lack of rainfall during the same period. It found that extremely hot weeks like the fourth week of December, the country’s hottest on record, were at least twice as likely now than before 1900. The analysis of lack of rainfall found no significant trend related to climate change.
Benjamin M. Sanderson, a researcher at the European Center for Research and Advanced Training in Scientific Computing in Toulouse, France, who was not involved in the study, said the findings were reasonable.
“You can quite solidly say that extreme high temperatures play a role in fire risk,” he said. “And anthropogenic influences are easily detectable in terms of extreme temperatures.”
But he agreed with the researchers that wildfire is complex, and said the Australian disaster exposed the weaknesses of today’s climate models: they have difficulty drawing the connections between climate and fire.
“There are some events on the ground that have huge human and ecological impacts,” he said. “This was one of them. You look at what came out of the models and realize they were not very good at representing the severity of this process.”
Dr. Sanderson, together with a colleague, Rosie A. Fisher, wrote a commentary in Nature last month arguing that improvements in modeling are needed to better capture the severity of wildfires as they evolve in a changing climate.
“This is really a case where the real world is beginning to throw events at us before science is realized,” he added. “Which is a scary place to be.”

Our best hope may be the weather.
For a long time, many people thought that it was a mistake to use the weather as evidence of climate change. Weather patterns contain a lot of randomness. Even as the earth warms and extreme weather becomes more common, some years are colder and calmer than others. If you argue that climate change is causing some weather trend, a climate denier may respond by making grand claims about a recent snowfall. 
  And yet the weather still has one big advantage over every other argument about the urgency of climate change: We experience the weather. We see it and feel it.
  It is not a complex data series in an academic study or government report. It's not a measurement of sea level or ice depth in a place you've never been. It's right in front of you. And although weather patterns do have a lot of randomness, they are indeed changing. That's the thing about climate change: It changes the climate.
  I wanted to write my last column of 2018 about the climate as a kind of plea: Amid everything else going on, don't lose sight of the most important story of the year.
  I know there was a lot of competition for that title, including some more obvious contenders, like President Trump and Robert Mueller. But nothing else measures up to the rising toll and enormous dangers of climate change. I worry that our children and grandchildren will one day ask us, bitterly, why we spent so much time distracted by lesser matters.
  The story of climate change in 2018 was complicated -- overwhelmingly bad, yet with two reasons for hope. The bad and the good were connected, too: Thanks to the changing weather, more Americans seem to be waking up to the problem.
  I'll start with the alarming parts of the story. The past year is on pace to be the earth's fourth warmest on record, and the five warmest years have all occurred since 2010. This warming is now starting to cause a lot of damage.
  In 2018, heat waves killed people in Montreal, Karachi, Tokyo and elsewhere. Extreme rain battered North Carolina and the Indian state of Kerala. The Horn of Africa suffered from drought. Large swaths of the American West burned. When I was in Portland, Ore., this summer, the air quality -- from nearby wildfires -- was among the worst in the world. It would have been healthier to be breathing outdoors in Beijing or Mumbai.
  Amid all of this destruction, Trump's climate agenda consists of making the problem worse. His administration is filled with former corporate lobbyists, and they have been changing federal policy to make it easier for companies to pollute. These officials like to talk about free enterprise and scientific uncertainty, but their real motive is usually money. Sometimes, they don't even wait to return to industry jobs. Both Scott Pruitt and Ryan Zinke, two now-departed pro-pollution cabinet secretaries, engaged in on-the-job corruption.
  I often want to ask these officials: Deep down, do you really believe that future generations of your own family will be immune from climate change's damage? Or have you chosen not to think very much about them?
  As for the two main reasons for hope: The first is that the Trump administration is an outlier. Most major governments are trying to slow climate change. So are many states in this country, as well as some big companies and nonprofit groups. This global coalition is the reason that the recent climate summit in Poland ''yielded much more,'' as Nat Keohane of the Environmental Defense Fund said, ''than many of us had thought might be possible.''
  The second reason for hope is public opinion. No, it isn't changing nearly as rapidly as I wish. Yet it is changing, and the weather seems to be a factor. The growing number of extreme events -- wildfires, storms, floods and so on -- are hard to ignore.
  Only 40 percent of Americans called the quality of environment ''good'' or ''excellent'' in a Gallup Poll this year, the lowest level in almost a decade. And 61 percent said the environment was getting worse. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, 66 percent of Americans said they wanted to see action to combat climate change. Some polls even suggest that Republican voters are becoming anxious about the situation.
  The politics of climate change remains devilishly hard, especially because so many people around the world feel frustrated about their living standards. France's ''gilet jaune'' protests, after all, were sparked by a proposed energy tax. Compared with day-to-day life, the effects of climate change have long felt distant, almost theoretical.
  But now those effects are becoming real, and they are terrifying. To anyone who worries about making a case for climate action based on the weather, I would simply ask: Do you have a better idea?

For the past few years, the Harvard professor David Keith has been sketching this vision: Ten Gulfstream jets, outfitted with special engines that allow them to fly safely around the stratosphere at an altitude of 70,000 feet, take off from a runway near the Equator. Their cargo includes thousands of pounds of a chemical compound — liquid sulfur, let’s suppose — that can be sprayed as a gas from the aircraft. It is not a one-time event; the flights take place throughout the year, dispersing a load that amounts to 25,000 tons. If things go right, the gas converts to an aerosol of particles that remain aloft and scatter sunlight for two years. The payoff? A slowing of the earth’s warming — for as long as the Gulfstream flights continue.
Keith argues that such a project, usually known as solar geoengineering, is technologically feasible and — with a back-of-the-envelope cost of under $1 billion annually — ought to be fairly cheap from a cost-benefit perspective, considering the economic damages potentially forestalled: It might do good for a world unable to cut carbon-dioxide emissions enough to prevent further temperature increases later this century.
What surprised me, then, as Keith paced around his Harvard office one morning in early March, was his listing all the reasons humans might not want to hack the environment. “Actually, I’m writing a paper on this right now,” he said. Most of his thoughts were related to the possible dangers of trying to engineer our way out of a climate problem of nearly unimaginable scientific, political and moral complexity. Solar geoengineering might lead to what some economists call “lock-in,” referring to the momentum that a new technology, even one with serious flaws, can assume after it gains a foothold in the market. The qwerty keyboard is one commonly cited example; the internal combustion engine is another. Once we start putting sulfate particles in the atmosphere, he mused, would we really be able to stop?
Another concern, he said, is “just the ethics about messing with nature.” Tall, wiry and kinetic, with thinning hair and a thick beard that gives him the look of the backcountry skier he is, Keith proudly showed me the framed badge that his father, a biologist, wore when he attended the landmark United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in 1972. Now 53, Keith has taken more wilderness trips — hiking, rock climbing, canoeing — than he can properly recall, and for their recent honeymoon, he and his wife were dropped off by helicopter 60 miles from the nearest road in northern British Columbia. “It was quite rainy,” he told me, “and that ended up making it even better.” So the prospect of intentionally changing the climate, he confessed, is not just unpleasant — “it initially struck me as nuts.”
It still strikes him as a moral hazard, to use a term he borrows from economics. A planet cooled by an umbrella of aerosol particles — an umbrella that works by reflecting back into space, say, 1 percent of the sun’s incoming energy — might give societies less incentive to adopt greener technologies and radically cut carbon emissions. That would be disastrous, Keith said. The whole point of geoengineering is not to give us license to forget about the buildup of CO₂. It’s to lessen the ill effects of the buildup and give us time to transition to cleaner energy.
Beyond these conceivable dangers, though, a more fundamental problem lurks: Solar geoengineering simply might not work. It has been a subject of intense debate among climate scientists for roughly a decade. But most of what we know about its potential effects derives from either computer simulations or studies on volcanic eruptions like that of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, which generated millions of tons of sunlight-scattering particulates and might have cooled the planet by as much as 0.5 degrees Celsius, or nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit. The lack of support for solar geoengineering’s efficacy informs Keith’s thinking about what we should do next. Actively tinkering with our environment — fueling up the Gulfstream jets and trying to cool things down — is not something he intends to try anytime soon, if ever. But conducting research is another matter.
A decade ago, when Keith was among the few American scientists to advocate starting a geoengineering research program, he was often treated at science conferences as an outlier. “People would sort of inch away or, really, tell me I shouldn’t be doing this,” he said. Geoengineering was seen as a scientific taboo and Keith its dark visionary. “The preconception was that I was some kind of Dr. Strangelove figure,” he told me — “which I didn’t like.”
Attitudes appear to have changed over the past few years, at least in part because of the continuing academic debates and computer-modeling studies. The National Academy of Sciences endorsed the pursuit of solar geoengineering research in 2015, a stance also taken in a later report by the Obama administration. A few influential environmental groups, like the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund, now favor research.
In the meantime, Keith’s own work at Harvard has progressed. This month, he is helping to start Harvard’s Solar Geoengineering Research Program, a broad endeavor that begins with $7 million in funding and intends to reach $20 million over seven years. One backer is the Hewlett Foundation; another is Bill Gates, whom Keith regularly advises on climate change. Keith is planning to conduct a field experiment early next year by putting particles into the stratosphere over Tucson.
The new Harvard program is not merely intent on getting its concepts out of the lab and into the field, though; a large share of its money will also be directed to physical and social scientists at the university, who will evaluate solar geoengineering’s environmental dangers — and be willing to challenge its ethics and practicality. Keith told me, “It’s really important that we have a big chunk of the research go to groups whose job will be to find all the ways that it won’t work.” In other words, the technology that Keith has long believed could help us ease our predicament — “the nuclear option” for climate, as one opponent described it to me, to be considered only when all else has failed — will finally be investigated to see whether it is a reasonable idea. At the same time, it will be examined under the premise that it may in fact be a very, very bad one.
Climate change already presents a demoralizing array of challenges — melting ice sheets and species extinctions — but the ultimate severity of its impacts depends greatly on how drastically technology and societies can change over the next few decades. The growth of solar and wind power in recent years, along with an apparent decrease in coal use, suggest that the global community will succeed in curtailing CO₂ emissions. Still, that may not happen nearly fast enough to avert some dangerous consequences. As Keith likes to point out, simply reducing emissions doesn’t reverse global warming. In fact, even if annual global CO₂ emissions decrease somewhat, the total atmospheric CO₂ may continue to increase, because the gas is so slow to dissipate. We may still be living with damaging amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide a half-century from now, with calamitous repercussions. The last time atmospheric CO₂ levels were as elevated as they are today, three million years ago, sea levels were most likely 45 feet higher, and giant camels roamed above the Arctic Circle.
Recently, I met with Daniel Schrag, who is the head of the Harvard University Center for the Environment, an interdisciplinary teaching and research department. Schrag, who helped recruit Keith to Harvard, painted a bleak picture of our odds of keeping global temperatures from rising beyond levels considered safe by many climate scientists. When you evaluate the time scales involved in actually switching our energy systems to cleaner fuels, Schrag told me, “the really depressing thing is you start to understand why any of these kinds of projections — for 2030 or 2050 — are absurd.” He went on: “Are they impossible? No. I want to give people hope, too. I’d love to make this happen. And we have made a lot of progress on some things, on solar, on wind. But the reality is we haven’t even started doing the hard stuff.”
Schrag described any kind of geoengineering as “at best an imperfect solution that is operationally extremely challenging.” Yet to Schrag and Keith, the political and technical difficulties associated with a rapid transition to a zero-carbon-emissions world make it sensible to look into geoengineering research. There happens to be a number of different plans for how to actually do it, however — including the fantastical (pumping seawater onto Antarctica to combat sea-level rise) and the impractical (fertilizing oceans with iron to foster the growth of algae, which would absorb more CO₂). Some proposals involve taking carbon out of the air, using either immense plant farms or absorption machines. (Keith is involved with such sequestration technology, which faces significant hurdles in terms of cost and feasibility.) Another possible approach would inject salt crystals into clouds over the ocean to brighten them and cool targeted areas, like the dying Great Barrier Reef. Still, the feeling among Keith and his colleagues is that aerosols sprayed into the atmosphere might be the most economically and technologically viable approach of all — and might yield the most powerful global effect.
It is not a new idea. In 2000, Keith published a long academic paper on the history of weather and climate modification, noting that an Institute of Rainmaking was established in Leningrad in 1932 and that American engineers began a cloud-seeding campaign in Vietnam a few decades later. A report issued in 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson’s administration called attention to the dangers of increasing concentrations of CO₂ and, anticipating Keith’s research, speculated that a logical response might be to change the albedo, or reflectivity, of the earth. To Keith’s knowledge, though, there have been only two actual field experiments so far. One, by a Russian scientist in 2009, released aerosols into the lower atmosphere via helicopter and appears to have generated no useful data. “It was a stunt,” Keith says. Another was a modest attempt at cloud brightening a few years ago by a team at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego.
Downstairs from Keith’s Harvard office, there is a lab cluttered with students fiddling with pipettes and arcane scientific instruments. When I visited in early March, Zhen Dai, a graduate student who works with Keith, was engaged with a tabletop apparatus, a maze of tubes and pumps and sensors, meant to study how chemical compounds interact with the stratosphere. For the moment, Keith’s group is leaning toward beginning its field experiments with ice crystals and calcium carbonate — limestone — that has been milled to particles a half-micron in diameter, or less than 1/100th the width of a human hair. They may eventually try a sulfur compound too. The experiment is called Scopex, which stands for Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment. An instrument that can disperse an aerosol of particles — say, several ounces of limestone dust — will be housed in a gondola that hangs beneath a balloon that ascends to 70,000 feet. The whole custom-built contraption, whose two small propellers will be steered from the ground, will also include a variety of sensors to collect data on any aerosol plume. Keith’s group will measure the sunlight-scattering properties of the plume and evaluate how its particles interact with atmospheric gases, especially ozone. The resulting data will be used by computer models to try to predict larger-scale effects.
But whether a scientist should be deliberately putting foreign substances into the atmosphere, even for a small experiment like this, is a delicate question. There is also the difficulty of deciding on how big the atmospheric plumes should get. When does an experiment become an actual trial run? Ultimately, how will the scientists know if geoengineering really works without scaling it up all the way?
Keith cites precedents for his thinking: a company that scatters cremation ashes from a high-altitude balloon, and jet engines, whose exhaust contains sulfates. But the crux of the problem that Harvard’s Solar Geoengineering Research Program wrestles with is intentionality. Frank Keutsch, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Harvard who is designing and running the Scopex experiments with Keith, told me: “This effort with David is very different from all my other work, because for those other field experiments, we’ve tried to measure the atmosphere and look at processes that are already there. You’re not actually changing nature.” But in this case, Keutsch agrees, they will be.
During one of our conversations, Keith suggested that I try to flip my thinking for a moment. “What if humanity had never gotten into fossil fuels,” he posed, “and the world had gone directly to generating energy from solar or wind power?” But then, he added, what if in this imaginary cleaner world there was a big natural seep of a heat-trapping gas from within the earth? Such events have happened before. “It would have all the same consequences that we’re worried about now, except that it’s not us doing the CO₂ emissions,” Keith said. In that case, the reaction to using geoengineering to cool the planet might be one of relief and enthusiasm.
In other words, decoupling mankind’s actions — the “sin,” as Keith put it, of burning fossil fuels — from our present dilemma can demonstrate the value of climate intervention. “No matter what, if we emit CO₂, we are hurting future generations,” Keith said. “And it may or may not be true that doing some solar geo would over all be a wise thing to do, but we don’t know yet. That’s the reason to do research.”
There are risks, undeniably — some small, others potentially large and terrifying. David Santillo, a senior scientist at Greenpeace, told me that some modeling studies suggest that putting aerosols in the atmosphere, which might alter local climates and rain patterns and would certainly affect the amount of sunlight hitting the earth, could have a significant impact on biodiversity. “There’s a lot more we can do in theoretical terms and in modeling terms,” Santillo said of the Harvard experiments, “before anyone should go out and do this kind of proof-of-concept work.” Alan Robock, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Rutgers, has compiled an exhaustive list of possible dangers. He thinks that small-scale projects like the Scopex experiment could be useful, but that we don’t know the impacts of large-scale geoengineering on agriculture or whether it might deplete the ozone layer (as volcanic eruptions do). Robock’s list goes on from there: Solar geoengineering would probably reduce solar-electricity generation. It would do nothing to reduce the increasing acidification of the oceans, caused by seawater absorbing carbon dioxide. A real prospect exists, too, that if solar geoengineering efforts were to stop abruptly for any reason, the world could face a rapid warming even more dangerous than what’s happening now — perhaps too fast for any ecological adaptation.
Keith is well aware of Robock’s concerns. He also makes the distinction that advocating research is not the same as advocating geoengineering. But the line can blur. Keith struck me as having a fair measure of optimism that his research can yield insights into materials and processes that can reduce the impacts of global warming while averting huge risks. For instance, he is already encouraged by computer models that suggest the Arctic ice cap, which has shrunk this year to the smallest size observed during the satellite era, could regrow under cooler conditions brought on by light-scattering aerosols. He also believes that the most common accusation directed against geoengineering — that it might disrupt precipitation patterns and lead to widespread droughts — will prove largely unfounded.
But Keith is not trained as an atmospheric scientist; he’s a hands-on physicist-engineer who likes to take machinery apart. There are deep unknowns here. Keutsch, for one, seems uncertain about what he will discover when the group actually tries spraying particulates high above the earth. The reduction of sunlight could adversely affect the earth’s water cycle, for example. “It really is unclear to me if this approach is feasible,” he says, “and at this point we know far too little about the risks. But if we want to know whether it works, we have to find out.”
Finally, what if something goes wrong either in research or in deployment? David Battisti, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington, told me, “It’s not obvious to me that we can reduce the uncertainty to anywhere near a tolerable level — that is, to the level that there won’t be unintended consequences that are really serious.” While Battisti thought Keith’s small Scopex experiment posed little danger — “The atmosphere will restore itself,” he said — he noted that the whole point of the Harvard researchers’ work is to determine whether solar geoengineering could be done “forever,” on a large-scale, round-the-clock basis. When I asked Battisti if he had issues with going deeper into geoengineering research, as opposed to geoengineering itself, he said: “Name a technology humans have developed that they haven’t used. I can’t think of any. So we can work on this for sure. But we are in this dilemma: Once we do develop this technology, it will be tempting to use it.”
Suppose Keith’s research shows that solar geoengineering works. What then? The world would need to agree where to set the global thermostat. If there is no consensus, could developed nations impose a geoengineering regimen on poorer nations? On the second point, if this technology works, it would arguably be unethical not to use it, because the world’s poorest populations, facing drought and rising seas, may suffer the worst effects of a changing climate.
In recent months, a group under the auspices of the Carnegie Council in New York, led by Janos Pasztor, a former United Nations climate official, has begun to work through the thorny international issues of governance and ethics. Pasztor told me that this effort will most likely take four years. And it is not lost on him — or anyone I spoke with in Keith’s Harvard group — that the idea of engineering our environment is taking hold as we are contemplating the engineering of ourselves through novel gene-editing technologies. “They both have an effect on shaping the pathway where human beings are now and where will they be,” says Sheila Jasanoff, a professor of science and technology studies at Harvard who sometimes collaborates with Keith. Jasanoff also points out that each technology potentially enables rogue agents to act without societal consent.
This is a widespread concern. We might reach a point at which some countries pursue geoengineering, and nothing — neither costs nor treaties nor current technologies — can stop them. Pasztor sketched out another possibility to me: “You could even have a nightmare scenario, where a country decides to do geoengineering and another country decides to do counter-geoengineering.” Such a countermeasure could take the form of an intentional release of a heat-trapping gas far more potent than CO₂, like a hydrochlorofluorocarbon. One of Schrag’s main concerns, in fact, is that geoengineering a lower global temperature might preserve ecosystems and limit sea-level rise while producing irreconcilable geopolitical frictions. “One thing I can’t figure out,” he told me, “is how do you protect the Greenland ice sheet and still have Russia have access to its northern ports, which they really like?” Either Greenland and Siberia will melt, or perhaps both can stay frozen. You probably can’t split the difference.
For the moment, and perhaps for 10 or 20 years more, these are mere hypotheticals. But the impacts of climate change were once hypotheticals, too. Now they’ve become possibilities and probabilities. And yet, as Tom Ackerman, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington, said at a recent discussion among policy makers that I attended in Washington: “We are doing an experiment now that we don’t understand.” He was not talking about geoengineering; he was observing that the uncertainty about the potential risks of geoengineering can obscure the fact that there is uncertainty, too, about the escalating disasters that may soon result from climate change.
His comment reminded me of a claim made more than a half-century ago, long before the buildup of CO₂ in the atmosphere had become the central environmental and economic problem of our time. Two scientists, Roger Revelle and Hans Suess, wrote in a scientific paper, “Human beings are now carrying out a large-scale geophysical experiment of a kind that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the future.”
If anything could sway a fence-sitter to consider whether geoengineering research makes sense, perhaps it is this. The fact is, we are living through a test already.

Grid managers ordered rolling blackouts across the state during a heat wave in August for the first time in two decades.
A report by California energy officials on Tuesday placed blame for rolling blackouts that left millions without power in August on the impact of climate change and outdated policies and practices that failed to adequately take into account hotter weather.
In the 121-page preliminary report to Gov. Gavin Newsom, the state’s three central energy organizations attributed the blackouts — the first in two decades — to a heat wave that increased demand for electricity while reducing the supply of power. Poor planning compounded those problems, according to the report, which was produced by the California Energy Commission, the California Public Utilities Commission and the California Independent System Operator.
“The combination of these factors was an extraordinary event,” the agencies said in the report. “But it is our responsibility and intent to plan for such events, which are becoming increasingly common in a world rapidly being impacted by climate change.”
As triple-digit temperatures blanketed the West on Aug. 14 and 15, the California I.S.O., which manages the power grid for 80 percent of the state, ordered utilities like Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison to black out as many as 3.3 million customers to reduce demand for electricity.
It was the first time the state had resorted to rolling blackouts since the 2000-1 energy crisis.
The decision angered Mr. Newsom, who said he had not been informed about the need for rolling blackouts until shortly before they began on Aug. 14. “These blackouts, which occurred without prior warning or enough time for preparation, are unacceptable and unbefitting of the nation’s largest and most innovative state,” he wrote in a letter to the grid manager and the two state agencies.
The governor, a Democrat, ordered an analysis of the events that resulted in blackouts during a pandemic. He also moved to reduce demand and increase power supplies by asking consumers and businesses to use less electricity and ordered the California State Water Resources Control Board to produce more electricity from dams under its control.
The report also pointed to problems in the energy trading market. For example, officials failed to properly forecast demand a day ahead of the blackouts and did not buy enough power. In addition, trading in the state’s electricity market made it difficult to identify “tight supply conditions,” the report said.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is also reviewing the blackouts. Neil Chatterjee, the commission’s chairman, said in a recent interview that it appeared that California had failed to properly plan its transition away from fossil fuels, but added that he would wait for a final report before drawing final conclusions.
“What looks to have taken place is California retired some gas generation, were counting on batteries and didn’t quite have those resources in place,” Mr. Chatterjee said.
Concern about a lack of power plants that can produce electricity throughout the day like natural gas plants led the state to extend operations of old plants that were expected to shut down this year. The state and its utilities are also seeking to install more batteries that can store power when there is too much supply and quickly provide it to the grid when demand surges.
“We are committed to working with the governor’s office, state agencies, and the broad set of stakeholders in California and across the Western U.S. to accelerate our efforts to reliably decarbonize the electricity grid,” Elliot Mainzer, the new president and chief executive of the California I.S.O., said in a statement.

CORQUÍN, Honduras -- The farmer stood in his patch of forlorn coffee plants, their leaves sick and wilted, the next harvest in doubt.
Last year, two of his brothers and a sister, desperate to find a better way to survive, abandoned their small coffee farms in this mountainous part of Honduras and migrated north, eventually sneaking into the United States. 
  Then in February, the farmer's 16-year-old son also headed north, ignoring the family's pleas to stay.
  The challenges of agricultural life in Honduras have always been mighty, from poverty and a neglectful government to the swings of international commodity prices.
  But farmers, agricultural scientists and industry officials say a new threat has been ruining harvests, upending lives and adding to the surge of families migrating to the United States: climate change.
  And their worries are increasingly shared by climate scientists as well.
  Gradually rising temperatures, more extreme weather events and increasingly unpredictable patterns -- like rain not falling when it should, or pouring when it shouldn't -- have disrupted growing cycles and promoted the relentless spread of pests.
  The obstacles have cut crop production or wiped out entire harvests, leaving already poor families destitute.
  Central America is among the regions most vulnerable to climate change, scientists say. And because agriculture employs much of the labor force -- about 28 percent in Honduras alone, according to the World Bank -- the livelihoods of millions of people are at stake.
  Last year, the bank reported that climate change could lead at least 1.4 million people to flee their homes in Mexico and Central America and migrate during the next three decades.
  The United States has allocated tens of millions of dollars in aid in recent years for farmers across Central America, including efforts to help them adapt to the changing climate.
  But President Trump has vowed to cut off all foreign aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador because of what he calls their failure to curb the flow of migrants north.
  Critics contend the punishment is misguided, though, because it could undermine efforts to address the very problems that are driving people to abandon their farms and head to the United States.
  ''If Donald Trump withdraws all the funds for Honduras, it's going to generate more unemployment, and that's going to generate more migration,'' said María Esperanza López, the general manager of Copranil, a coffee-growers cooperative here in western Honduras. ''And that's going to result in more abandoned farms.''
  Coffee cultivators in the region are at particular risk of disruption because the crop is highly sensitive to weather variations.
  Fredi Onan Vicen Peña, the coffee farmer whose brothers, sister and teenage son have already given up and joined the exodus north, reached over and tore a leaf off one of his plants.
  It was a mottled yellow and brown: signs of coffee rust, a disease whose spread has been influenced by climate variability. As much as 70 percent of his crop, planted across five acres in a pine forest, had been affected, he estimated, and there was little chance he could salvage it.
  ''Climate change is destroying some farms,'' said Mr. Vicen, 41.
  Beyond that, some of his healthier plants had begun to blossom nearly two months ahead of schedule because of a heavy unseasonable downpour, throwing the entire growing cycle into doubt.
  ''This is not something we predicted,'' Mr. Vicen said.
  Average temperatures have risen by about two degrees Fahrenheit in Central America over the past several decades, making the cultivation of coffee difficult, if not untenable, at lower altitudes that were once suitable.
  That has forced some farmers to search for land at higher altitudes, switch to other crops, change professions -- or migrate.
  ''Some very fine families that have been producing quality coffee for a long time are now facing the decision of whether to stay in coffee,'' said Catherine M. Tucker, a professor of anthropology at the University of Florida who has done research in Honduras for more than two decades.
  Some climate scientists say that in the absence of long-term meteorological data, it is hard for them to say with certainty whether the increasing variability is caused by long-term changes in the region's climate. But, they say, they are leaning in that direction.
  ''It's becoming so unusual, it's almost certainly climate change,'' said Dr. Edwin J. Castellanos, dean of the Research Institute at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala, a university in Guatemala City, and one of Central America's leading scientists in the field of climate change.
  Climate change is rarely the sole factor in the decision to migrate. Violence and poverty are prime drivers, but climate change can be a tipping point, farmers and experts say.
  ''Small farmers are already living in poverty; they're already at the threshold of not being able to survive,'' Mr. Castellanos said. ''So any changes in the situation may push them to have enough incentives to leave.''
  The outlook for the region seems bleak. Reduced yields of coffee and subsistence crops like corn and beans could significantly increase food insecurity and malnutrition. By some predictions, the amount of land suitable for growing coffee in Central America could drop by more than 40 percent by 2050.
  The number of coffee producers in the area where Mr. Vicen lives has dropped by a quarter in the past decade -- to about 9,000 from about 12,000 -- partly because of pressure from climate change, said Marlon Danilo Mejía, the regional coordinator for the Honduran Coffee Institute, an industry trade group.
  A vast majority are small producers, managing less than about nine acres each, he said.
  José Edgardo Vicen, 37, one of Mr. Vicen's brothers, had weighed migrating for years. He had worked in the coffee fields since he was a boy, continuing the family tradition. In this part of Honduras, coffee is a major crop, with an increasing amount bound for North America, Europe and Asia.
  But after a rust outbreak and other pressures in recent years, including plunging commodity prices, the younger Mr. Vicen said he could no longer earn enough from his harvest to cover production costs.
  He headed north with his 14-year-old son last August, crossed the border illegally and settled in Texas. A brother and a sister, driven by similar circumstances, left Honduras soon afterward and also sneaked into the United States.
  ''For the small producer, I promise you, there's no way to get ahead,'' said Mr. Vicen, who now works in construction and sends remittances home to support his wife and daughter.
  When he was younger, harvest time ''was like a party,'' he recalled. Now, ''there are only losses, no profits.''
  Fifteen producers from the Vicens' coffee cooperative -- more than 10 percent of its members -- have migrated to the United States in the past year, said Ms. Esperanza López, the general manager of the cooperative. They have joined thousands of others from villages in Honduras's western highlands.
  Stephanie Leutert, director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin, said that government statistics on apprehension of migrants at the southwest border of the United States in recent years reflect a sharp increase in people from western Honduras.
  After large caravans of migrants arrived last fall in Tijuana, Mexico, a United Nations survey found that 72 percent of those surveyed were from Honduras -- and 28 percent of the respondents had worked in the agricultural sector.
  The exodus of farm workers has worsened already serious labor shortages in western Honduras. Some industry leaders in the region joke that if the caravans in recent months were ''the laborer caravans,'' the next wave will be ''the grower caravans.''
  Coffee farmers have been scrambling to adjust to the changes, learning which species are more resistant to plague and drought, and branching out into other crops -- like cacao, avocados or trees that produce construction-grade wood.
  Nongovernmental and public-private initiatives have also taken root in coffee-growing regions of Central America and around the world to help guide farmers. Some have received the backing of the world's biggest coffee sellers -- like Starbucks, Tim Horton's and Lavazza -- trying to ensure their future supply.
  Yet even the application of best practices is no guarantee that everything will be fine.
  ''The weather is crazy,'' said Carlos Peña Orellana, 58, a farmer and member of a local coffee cooperative. ''Everything's out of control.''
  He owns 12 acres of land but can afford to farm only about five. He gets by with income from a tomato greenhouse he built with the cooperative's help, and with remittances from two sons who migrated to the United States after struggling through the rust crisis of 2012-13.
  ''They're helping to revive the farm,'' he said at his ramshackle ranch one recent afternoon. ''It's really difficult now.''
  He turned to his youngest son, Carlos, 12, and saw a future migrant. Pointing a leathery finger, he said: ''You're next, right?'' Mr. Peña chuckled. The boy squirmed, saying nothing.

Still sick and dependent on a potent cocktail of antiviral drugs and steroids, President Trump turned his highly choreographed return to the White House into another vivid example of the recurrent theme of his presidency: the denial of obvious facts when they don’t meet his political needs.
His message on Monday evening and reiterated on Tuesday was that Americans  had nothing to fear from the coronavirus, and it denied the obvious: The disease he said would disappear as the weather warmed in the spring, “like a miracle,” had already claimed the lives of more than 210,000 of his compatriots.
Mr. Trump wasn’t really saying anything new — he has minimized the effects of the virus since January — and his presidency has in many ways been defined by his dismissal of many of the biggest threats facing the United States. His preoccupation with demonstrating strength or rearranging facts to reinforce his worldview has led him, time and again, to downplay, ignore or mock everything from climate change to Russian interference in the American political process.
Mr. Trump’s own Pentagon declared in a report last year that a warming climate was a major “national security issue” that could spur future instability around the globe, but to Mr. Trump it remains a theory, something to be stricken from government reports and explained away when the West erupted in wildfires.
His intelligence agencies have assessed that North Korea’s nuclear stockpile has expanded significantly on Mr. Trump’s watch. But to the president, that arsenal — which he said in 2017 might force him to take military action leading to “fire and fury like the world has never seen” — is hardly worth mention today. Asked about it, he invariably turns the conversation to his relationship with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader.
The unremitting stream of cyberattacks by Russia, many aimed at the heart of the American political process, has preoccupied intelligence and military officials determined to keep Vladimir V. Putin from interfering in another election. But not Mr. Trump, who has said he has no reason to disbelieve the Russian leader’s denials that Moscow was involved.
On virtually every front, said Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, Mr. Trump has embraced “denialism,” as if wishing problems away was a substitute for policy and action.
“The denialism is a pattern,” said Mr. Haass, who served several Republican presidents at the National Security Council and the State Department. “It is pervasive. And the fear among friends and allies is that all this is not limited to Trump but reflects how this country has not just changed, but changed for the worse.”
“They have put their security in our hands,” said Mr. Haass, the author of “The World: A Brief Introduction,” “and they are questioning that wisdom, at the same moment that our adversaries see us as divided and distracted.”
It is a distinctive pattern that began in the Trump administration’s first hours, when the new president bristled at photographs released by the National Park Service that suggested the crowds at his inauguration paled when compared with the turnouts for the swearing-in of some past presidents, including Barack Obama. Then came his search for three million fraudulent votes — all in the service of denying that he had lost the popular vote, even while winning the Electoral College.
Some of the moments were laughable, like the Sharpie used to alter National Weather Service maps of the course of Hurricane Dorian last year, all to justify Mr. Trump’s erroneous declaration that the storm was headed to Alabama.
It was great fodder for late-night comedians. Then, in March, as the virus emptied out offices and began to strike American cities, denialism went from deadly serious to simply deadly.
Mr. Trump’s own Department of Health and Human Services, with the help of the White House staff, had prepared for an influenza pandemic that many experts had viewed as inevitable. They had even run a monthslong exercise, code-named “Crimson Contagion,” that mapped out how the government needed to respond if a virus — somewhat different from the coronavirus — that originated in China came to American shores aboard direct flights, borne by tourists, students, business executives and returning Americans.
But the tabletop exercise missed one key element: a president who made it clear he didn’t want to hear news that imperiled economic expansion, especially in an election year.
“Nobody ever thought of numbers like this,” Mr. Trump said in mid-March, as his early story that the virus was under control began to collapse around him.
In fact, they had — it was simply that Mr. Trump did not want to acknowledge those numbers. He kept downplaying the casualties, saying he was sure that deaths would top out below 60,000 and creating a White House culture where mask-wearing was equated with weakness, rather than the pandemic equivalent of strapping on seatbelts.
Mr. Trump has also seemed incapable, or at least unwilling, to acknowledge the cost of denying reality. He continues to insist the economy will have a “V shaped” recovery, even though the Federal Reserve chairman he appointed, Jerome Powell, said on Tuesday that Americans should brace for a “longer-than-expected slog back to full recovery.”
Mr. Powell warned of potentially tragic consequences if economic stimulus wasn’t extended; hours later Mr. Trump pulled the plug on negotiations with Democrats, saying he would take it all up again after he won re-election.
The recklessness of mocking mask-wearing appealed to the base, but imperiled his staff, his Secret Service detail and his supporters.
Anyone who thought the president might be chastened by his personal experience with the coronavirus, from the drop in his oxygen levels to his helicopter evacuation to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, got a dose of reality when he insisted on being driven around the outside of the hospital to wave at his supporters, no matter what the risk to his protective detail in an armored limousine designed to cut off outside air.
But it was his return to the White House that showed Mr. Trump was determined to turn his infection from a vulnerability into another sign of strength, of triumph. He declared that the United States should just soldier forward, even while his press secretary was announcing that she, too, had the coronavirus.
And his dramatic ripping off of his mask as he returned to the White House, even though he knew he would be encountering White House staff members as soon as he stepped indoors, drove home his determination to deny the risks — not for him, but for those who worked for him.
Now he presides over an executive branch that is running on half speed. Most of the Joint Chiefs of Staff are in isolation. His chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, is working at home because he has comorbidities, and his staff is staying away, too.
In short, there was nothing the president was doing at the White House, one of his aides conceded, that he couldn’t have gotten done from the sprawling presidential suite at Walter Reed. Except it wouldn’t have looked right — it would have looked as if Mr. Trump was sick.

Also this week: A record, and a glitch, on an Arctic science expedition
Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. 
On Monday, oil prices saw their biggest one-day drop since 1991, driven down by coronavirus fears and a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. If we’re entering an era of really cheap oil, it’s worth asking what that could mean for climate change.
The traditional view is that a plunge in oil prices hurts efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions, as people use more oil and disregard alternatives like electric cars. Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency, has warned that cheap oil may slow the transition to cleaner energy worldwide.
But there are also reasons to think the old rules may not apply this time, and that the climate impact of cheap oil doesn’t have to be so stark.
Cheap oil, for instance, has often depressed sales of electric cars. But nowadays, a large share of electric vehicle sales is being driven by regulations in places like China, Europe and California. Those aren’t going away. What’s more, battery prices have been quickly falling over time, which means that electric cars are steadily becoming more competitive with conventional cars, even if you ignore fuel costs.
“For most consumers, high upfront prices are the biggest thing holding electric vehicles back,” Colin McKerracher, head of advanced transport at Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said in an email. “Battery prices matter more than oil prices. If those keep falling, electric vehicle adoption will keep going up.”
He added: “Automakers are unlikely to change their long-term plans as a result of fluctuations in the oil market. Electrification is here to stay.”
Generally, a drop in oil prices also leads to an increase in travel, as people take advantage of low prices at the pump or cheaper airfares. But that’s less likely to happen this time, since worries about the coronavirus outbreak are keeping many people at home.
One big question, said Amy Myers Jaffe, an oil expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, is whether the coronavirus outbreak could permanently alter people’s work and transportation habits as companies get more comfortable with remote work and videoconferencing, reducing oil demand over time. “It will be interesting to see if we see big structural changes once this crisis subsides,” she said.
Another dynamic to watch: The oil crash, which is putting a financial strain on drilling companies, could cause some companies to reconsider their plans to invest in low-carbon technology. Alternatively, some companies may decide that renewable sources like wind and solar are actually a safer investment in a world of unstable oil prices.
But the biggest wild card is how policymakers react to the economic slowdown that’s being driven by coronavirus fears. If countries like China try to revitalize their economy by subsidizing polluting industries like steel and cement, emissions could soar in the coming months. During a period of economic crisis, climate concerns often fade, many analysts have noted.
But there’s another scenario: Governments could seize this moment to enact new climate policies. Low oil prices are often a good opportunity to remove subsidies for fossil fuels, which have been increasing in recent years, or raise taxes on carbon dioxide emissions, since consumers are less likely to feel the impact.
“Policymakers may try to bail out the conventional energy system and continue on as usual,” said Michael Webber, chief science and technology officer at Engie, a French energy company. “Or they could try to scale back subsidies for fossil fuels, help retrain workers into cleaner sectors, and take the moment to try to address the climate problem.”
In other words, it’s really up to us.
An Arctic resupply mission needs some help itself
Here’s the good news: A Russian icebreaker on a voyage to resupply a climate change research expedition barely 100 miles from the North Pole finally reached its destination after struggling through heavy ice for weeks.
Here’s the bad: The ship, Kapitan Dranitsyn, burned so much fuel that now it, too, has to be resupplied. Another icebreaker is on its way to bring it more fuel.
Such are the logistical complexities of the expedition, known as Mosaic, in which a German research ship, Polarstern, has been drifting with the sea ice in the Arctic Ocean since October with a revolving complement of scientists. The ship is expected to come out of the ice east of Greenland in September            after gathering a year’s worth of data on conditions in the remote Central Arctic.
The Kapitan Dranitsyn left Tromso, Norway, on Jan. 29 with 43 tons of food, fuel and other supplies for the Polarstern, as well as a replacement team of researchers and technicians for what is the third two-month leg of the expedition. The resupply trip was expected to take about two weeks, but the icebreaker ran into trouble from the start, when a storm in the Barents Sea forced it to anchor off Tromso for the better part of a week.
Once underway, the ship encountered sea ice that had gotten much thicker as the winter progressed — doubling to more than 5 feet, or 1.5 meters, in places. The Kapitan Dranitsyn finally arrived at the Polarstern on Feb. 28.
After several days unloading the supplies and transferring personnel across about a half-mile of ice in dangerous conditions (a wind chill of minus 72 degrees Fahrenheit, or about minus 58 Celsius), the Kapitan Dranitsyn left for the return trip to Tromso. But calculations showed that it would not have enough diesel fuel for the journey.
So on March 3, another icebreaker, the Admiral Makarov, left Murmansk, Russia, with a load of extra fuel to intercept the Kapitan Dranitsyn on its way. Early this week, the two ships were about 350 miles, or roughly 560 kilometers, apart.
Markus Rex, an atmospheric scientist who is Mosaic’s leader, wrote in a blog post that the delay in resupplying the Polarstern was “absolutely in keeping with what had to be expected” given the ice conditions.
Polarstern, by the way, set a record on this trip. The ship reached 88°36’ North on Feb. 24. That’s just 97 miles from the North Pole. Never before had a surface vessel ventured so far north during the Arctic winter.
With the ice expected to become even thicker, the expedition, as planned, will abandon icebreakers for the next relief missions. Instead, supplies and people will be brought in by airplane or, as a last resort, by long-range helicopters. A crew from the Polarstern, using machines made for grooming ski slopes, has built a 1,300-foot runway on the ice.
By mid-June, when the ice will be melting and thinning, the Polarstern will once again be reachable by ship. A Swedish icebreaker, the Oden, is expected to make two resupply trips.

MIAMI — Real estate agents looking to sell coastal properties usually focus on one thing: how close the home is to the water’s edge. But buyers are increasingly asking instead how far back it is from the waterline. How many feet above sea level? Is it fortified against storm surges? Does it have emergency power and sump pumps?
Rising sea levels are changing the way people think about waterfront real estate. Though demand remains strong and developers continue to build near the water in many coastal cities, homeowners across the nation are slowly growing wary of buying property in areas most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
A warming planet has already forced a number of industries — coal, oil, agriculture and utilities among them — to account for potential future costs of a changed climate. The real estate industry, particularly along the vulnerable coastlines, is slowly awakening to the need to factor in the risks of catastrophic damage from climate change, including that wrought by rising seas and storm-driven flooding.
But many economists say that this reckoning needs to happen much faster and that home buyers urgently need to be better informed. Some analysts say the economic impact of a collapse in the waterfront property market could surpass that of the bursting dot-com and real estate bubbles of 2000 and 2008.
The fallout would be felt by property owners, developers, real estate lenders and the financial institutions that bundle and resell mortgages.
Over the past five years, home sales in flood-prone areas grew about 25 percent less quickly than in counties that do not typically flood, according to county-by-county data from Attom Data Solutions, the parent company of RealtyTrac. Many coastal residents are rethinking their investments and heading for safer ground.
“I don’t see how this town is going to defeat the water,” said Brent Dixon, a resident of Miami Beach who plans to move north and away from the coast in anticipation of worsening king tides, the highest predicted tide of the year. “The water always wins.”
These concerns have taken on a new urgency since the presidential election of Donald J. Trump, who has long been a skeptic of global warming, claiming in 2012 that it was a concept “created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.”
A real estate developer, Mr. Trump is also the owner of several South Florida properties, including Mar-a-Lago, a 20-acre site that stretches between the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway in Palm Beach.
Mr. Trump’s recent selection of Myron Ebell to lead his Environmental Protection Agency transition team intensified these worries in            Florida and among many climate scientists. Mr. Ebell has helped lead the charge against the scientific consensus that global warming exists and is caused by people.
State lawmakers in Massachusetts and New Jersey are pushing to impose new rules on real estate agents and others, obligating them to disclose climate-related damage like previous flooding.
Banks and insurers need to protect their collateral and investors more by improving their methods for estimating climate-change risks and creating more standardized rules for reporting them publicly, economists warn.
In April, Sean Becketti, the chief economist for Freddie Mac, the government-backed mortgage giant, issued a dire prediction. It is only a matter of time, he wrote, before sea level rise and storm surges become so unbearable along the coast that people will leave, ditching their mortgages and potentially triggering another housing meltdown — except this time, it would be unlikely that these housing prices would ever recover.
“Some residents will cash out early and suffer minimal losses,” he wrote. “Others will not be so lucky.”
Bull’s-Eye for Property Damage
Much of the uncertainty surrounding climate change focuses on the pace of the rise in sea levels. But some argue that this misses the point because property values will probably go under water long before the properties themselves do.
What is often called “nuisance” flooding — inundation caused more by tides than weather — is already affecting property values. Often just a foot or two deep, this type of flooding can stop traffic, swamp basements, damage cars and contaminate groundwater.
Florida has six of the 10 American urban centers most vulnerable to storm surge, according to a 2016 report from CoreLogic, a real estate data firm. Southeast Florida experiences about 10 tidal floods per year now. That number is likely to be around 240 floods per year by 2045, according to climate researchers.
In the past year, home sales have increased 2.6 percent nationally, but have dropped about 7.6 percent in high-risk flood zones in Miami-Dade County, according to housing data. Many coastal cities are taking steps toward mitigation, digging runoff tunnels, elevating roads and building detention ponds.
James Murley, Miami-Dade’s chief resilience officer, said it was important to avoid spooking the market since real estate investment produces much of the revenue that pays for these upgrades. This balancing act is especially important in Florida because the state and localities rely heavily on property and sales taxes for funding such projects.
Florida is not alone. Forty percent of Americans live and work in coastal areas, and those who can afford it are protecting their investments by building private bulkheads and lifting their homes onto stilts. But skeptics question the logic of upgrading individual properties if the surrounding areas do not keep pace and flooding or the rise in sea levels swamps nearby roads.
For many home buyers and owners, the cost of flood insurance is a growing worry. As premiums rise, property values fall, a trend already hurting home prices in places like Atlantic City, Norfolk, Va., and St. Petersburg, Fla., according to local real estate agents.
Roy and Carol Baker, who now live in Sarasota, Fla., recalled trying for several months to sell their home in nearby Siesta Key in 2014. Interested buyers kept backing out of the purchase when they found out that the annual flood insurance premium was roughly $7,000, they said.
This experience will become more common, economists say, as the federal government shifts away from subsidizing flood insurance rates to get premiums closer to reflecting the true market cost of the risk.
As difficult as it is to predict the pace of climate change, modeling how it will affect the real estate market is even more complicated. Like a game of hot potato, builders, homeowners, banks, flood insurers and buyers of securitized mortgages try to hand off risky properties before getting burned. Developers erect houses and sell them typically within a couple of years, long before their investments depreciate. Banks earn commissions even on risky home loans before bundling these mortgages into securities and selling them to large pension funds, insurers or other buyers.
Home buyers tend to think short term, focus on what they can afford and hope that the local infrastructure keeps pace with the rise in sea levels. Home buyers are also generally on their own as they look at prospective properties and try to size up their risk, as real estate agents vary in what they disclose.
Most real estate agents say they try to tackle the issue head-on, providing clients with maps indicating federally declared high-risk flood zones, and using climate-change preparedness as a selling point, emphasizing if the house has a backup generator or shingles that can withstand hurricane-strength winds.
But real estate agents risk putting themselves at a competitive disadvantage by overstating threats. Good information is hard to come by. No one knows whether, when or by how much properties will depreciate, seas will encroach or flood insurance policies will change.
Valerie Amor, a real estate agent in Fort Lauderdale, said that, unlike most in her industry, she does a feasibility study before she assists in either buying or selling property.
“It should not be left as a moral or personal decision,” said Ms. Amor, adding that more disclosure should be mandatory.
Disclosing Natural Disasters
Norfolk is a city surrounded by water. In 2014, the Federal Emergency Management Agency expanded the area designated as highest risk for a flood in an update to regional maps, requiring thousands of new homeowners to have flood insurance. The real estate industry worried about the impact on the market. Lawmakers responded.
The region around Norfolk has among the highest rates of annual sea level rise on the East Coast. Rising water and sinking land could push the relative sea level up in some parts by six feet by the end of the century, the United States Army Corps of Engineers estimates. Flood insurance in moderate- to low-risk areas nationally costs more than $200 a year, according to the National Flood Insurance Program, but for properties in flood zones, those rates could rise by as much as several thousand dollars.
Virginia requires real estate agents to reveal whether a property is in a military airplane noise zone, has defective drywall or has ever been used to manufacture methamphetamine. After the flood maps were updated, the industry wondered what new disclosure rules would be mandated. Should homeowners or their agents be required to reveal to potential buyers if the house had been flooded? Should they have to tell how much flood insurance cost and was estimated to rise?
Within a year, state lawmakers passed a real estate disclosure law that the industry hailed as a major step forward. “We are immensely satisfied,” Deborah Baisden, then president of the Virginia Association of Realtors, said of the law.
While the law encourages home buyers to exert due diligence in investigating the risk of living in a flood hazard area, it also explicitly states that the seller of a home is not obligated to disclose whether the home is in a zone that FEMA regards as high risk.
Some city officials said the law did not go far enough. “It’s a nondisclosure disclosure,” Meg Pittenger, an environmental manager for the city of Portsmouth, Va., told           a           reporter for The Virginian-Pilot. She added that it should have required sellers or agents to inform prospective buyers whether a property lies in a flood zone.
Flood risks are easily overlooked because past flood damage often goes unreported and, as in Virginia, the burden of discovering it falls to the buyer. LexisNexis, a news and legal research company, can supply sellers a report with the history of flood claims on the property, but buyers usually do not know to ask for it. FEMA collects information on federal insurance claims for homes nationally, but the agency has been reluctant to make it public for privacy reasons.
States and local real estate agents are handling disclosure differently. In Florida, real estate agents have to notify purchasers if a property is subject to natural hazards, but the law applies only to a limited area along the Florida coast and has no penalties for noncompliance. And in 2010 lawmakers stripped the requirement to disclose a property’s windstorm mitigation rating.
California, Washington and Pennsylvania, on the other hand, require the disclosure of past flooding or susceptibility to future flooding. In New York, sellers are required to disclose whether a property sits in a flood plain. “It may be a matter of life and death,” said State Senator Stewart Greenleaf of Pennsylvania, who sponsored a state disclosure rule that became law this year.
Some real estate agents around Boston have begun taking prospective buyers to newly repaired multimillion-dollar sea walls built to protect homes from storm damage. They also have begun to encourage clients to increase the marketability of their properties by installing storm-resistant technology, including steel beams and window flaps that allow water to flow in and out of a basement during a flood.
Not everyone favors more disclosure, said Daren Blomquist, the senior vice president of communications at Attom Data Solutions, the real estate data tracking firm that serves brokers, lenders and insurers. After strong objections from real estate companies, which threatened to stop providing data, his firm took down its web page that integrated real estate listings with plot-by-plot information about the risks of floods, hurricanes, wildfires and other natural hazards.
“The pressure was intense,” he said, adding that the company still provides this information on separate web pages.
Banks and Insurers Try to Adapt
It is not just property owners, buyers and sellers who are struggling to estimate the potential financial impact of climate change on the real estate market. These risks compound as individual mortgages get bundled and sold as securities. In his April report, Mr. Becketti, the Freddie Mac economist, emphasized how difficult it was to predict whether the bubble in coastal real estate would slowly deflate or suddenly pop.
“Will the value of the house decline gradually as the expected life of the house becomes shorter?” he wrote. “Or, alternatively, will the value of the house — and all the houses around it — plunge the first time a lender refuses to make a mortgage on a nearby house or an insurer refuses to issue a homeowner’s policy?”
The real estate and mortgage markets have been slow to confront climate change, said Albert Slap, an environmental lawyer and the president of Coastal Risk Consulting, a company that advises communities on how to prepare for sea level rise. Most buyers of securities, for example, underestimate the risk in their portfolios by relying on FEMA flood maps, he said. Strictly backward looking, these maps are based on floods that have already occurred.
To make matters worse, the National Flood Insurance Program is more than $20 billion in debt. After several major coastal storms, Congress tried to fix the program, passing a law in 2012 requiring that insurance premiums be recalculated to accurately reflect risk. Coastal homeowners rebelled, arguing that the legislation made insurance unaffordable, and in 2014 Congress repealed parts of the law.
George Kasimos, a real estate expert in Toms River, N.J., said homeowners had good reason to react. “A homeowner may be approved for a $300,000 mortgage with a $3,000 a year flood insurance premium,” he said, but the same person’s loan application would most likely be rejected with a $10,000 flood insurance premium. As insurance prices rise, some home purchases will become cash only, squeezing more middle-class and lower-income buyers out of the market.
The North Carolina shore has been especially popular among baby boomers along the East Coast looking for an affordable retirement option.
David Jacobs, 54, said he expected that his home — about 50 feet from the water in Wrightsville Beach, N.C. — will be washed away soon enough. “It pains me to think my children and grandchildren may not be able to enjoy it,” he said, adding that his flood insurance is now about $400 more per month than it was when he moved there in 2013.
Economists have also called for reporting rules so securities investors would know what portion of their bundled mortgages includes high risk from climate change, like properties in coastal regions, river flood plains, flammable canyons and mountainsides, earthquake zones, tsunami washout zones and tornado alleys.
“Coastal mortgages are growing into as big a bubble as the housing market of 2007,” said Philip Stoddard, the mayor of South Miami. But this time, he said, there will not be a rebound because the waters will not recede and properties will eventually lose all of their value.
Politicians are more focused on keeping developers calm and reassuring people that technological solutions will save the day, he said, which plays into an expectation, especially among the wealthiest homeowners, that the government will bail them out if property values crash.
Riding Out the Storm
Coastal homeowners are reluctant to leave. Robert Meyer, the co-director of the Risk Management and Decision Processes Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, has been using web surveys to assess the willingness of South Florida residents to pay higher taxes for climate-change upgrades rather than move.
“They show a remarkable willingness to stick it out,” Mr. Meyer said. His study found that by 2050 people would still be living in the riskiest areas and would have incrementally paid billions of dollars for adaptation measures.
Despite the slowdown in home sales, many flood-prone cities are still growing. Skyscrapers and new apartment buildings are going up all around Fort Lauderdale. The local chamber of commerce says the city expects to add about 50,000 people in the next 15 years and currently lacks housing to accommodate them. In Miami, much of the new construction consists of luxury condos aimed at a large number of cash buyers from Russia and Latin America.
Nationally, median home prices in areas at high risk for flooding are still 4.4 percent below what they were 10 years ago, while home prices in low-risk areas are up 29.7 percent over the same period, according to the housing data.
Chris Bergh, the South Florida conservation director at the Nature Conservancy, said he was worried because his house on Big Pine Key was just over a half-mile from the beach and only about five feet above sea level.
“In planning for my 7-year-old child’s future,” he said, “I can’t count on him inheriting a valuable piece of property on Big Pine Key.”

WASHINGTON --  When President Obama tried to tackle climate change in his first term, he pushed Congress to limit and put a price on carbon pollution, but the so-called cap-and-trade bill died in the Senate in 2010. Among the chief reasons: Lawmakers from both parties feared that any law to cut greenhouse gas emissions would harm the nation's competitiveness compared with China, which was then emerging as the world's largest polluter.
Since then, Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates have repeatedly cited China's lack of action on climate change as the chief reason that the United States should not take stronger action. 
  On Friday in the Rose Garden, the story of how Washington and Beijing will fight climate change took a stunning turn as President Xi Jinping of China stood with Mr. Obama and announced that China would put in place its own national cap-and-trade system in 2017. Environmentalists hailed the announcement as historic and said that China's move should effectively end Republicans' main objection to enacting a domestic climate change policy.
  ''The ironies are rich,'' said David Sandalow, a fellow at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy and a former senior official in the Obama administration. ''Carbon emissions trading is an American idea. Now it's an American export. The Europeans have moved forward in implementing it. Now the Chinese are embracing it on a large scale.''
  But news of China's cap-and-trade policy did not seem to change the views of a number of Republican presidential candidates.
  ''Any deal that our current representatives make with China will allow China to laugh all the way to the bank,'' Donald J. Trump, who is leading the Republican field in most polls, said in a statement. ''Their negotiators are too smart, sophisticated and cunning for the people representing the U.S. I'd much rather wait until I attain office so that we can make a real deal with China and bring jobs and money back to make America great again.''
  Asked about climate change policy during a CNN interview this week, Mr. Trump said that he did not believe in climate change and that climate change policies ''imperil our country.'' He also said, ''By the way, China's doing nothing.''
  In 2012, Mr. Trump posted on Twitter, ''The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing noncompetitive.''
  Other Republican candidates have expressed similar views. At the Sept. 16 Republican debate, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said: ''We are not going to make America a harder place to create jobs in order to pursue policies that will do absolutely nothing, nothing to change our climate, to change our weather, because America is a lot of things, the greatest country in the world, absolutely. But America is not a planet. And we are not even the largest carbon producer anymore, China is. And they're drilling a hole and digging anywhere in the world that they can get ahold of.''
  Asked on Friday for Mr. Rubio's response to the Chinese president's announcement, a spokeswoman for his campaign, Brooke Sammon, wrote in an email, ''Marco is opposed to cap-and-trade and other forms of a national energy tax.'' She added, ''He has outlined concrete proposals that will help us seize our energy potential without increasing the reach of the E.P.A.''
  Jeb Bush, a former Florida governor, has vowed to repeal Mr. Obama's climate change regulations if he is elected president. Asked about his reaction to China's announcement, a campaign spokeswoman, Allie Brandenburger, wrote in an email, ''The U.S. is one of the world's leaders in reducing greenhouse gasses. We've reduced our emissions by 10 percent since 2005. That's not because of a big government program but largely due to American innovation. That is the right way forward for our economy, families and the nation.''
  In Congress, Senator James M. Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican who leads the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and has called the science of human-caused climate change a hoax, was sharply critical of the agreement.
  ''These public pledges sound good, but come with serious economic consequences for the United States,'' he said in a statement. ''The Obama administration will use regulatory overreach to claim our nation's commitment, while China's pledge has no guarantee of enforcement. This is a great deal for the Chinese, who are slated to continue increasing emissions with the potential of capping them years from now.''
  Experts in Chinese climate change policy say there is reason to trust that the Chinese government will move forward with its plans to enact a cap-and-trade system on its economy -- but also cause to be skeptical about whether the plans will be enforced.
  They point out that the Chinese government moved to curb pollution from coal plants and factories not because of pressure from the United States, but after citizen protests against dirty air threatened to disrupt political stability.
  China has been moving toward developing a national cap-and-trade system for at least three years. In preparation, it has launched seven pilot programs in different provinces. ''We are learning from our carbon emissions trading pilots,'' said Su Wei, China's chief climate change negotiator. ''First and foremost is the political commitment to carbon markets.''
  Other experts cautioned that it might be difficult for China to fully carry out the technology and transparent accounting necessary to create a new financial commodity market. When the European Union implemented a cap-and-trade market, the program suffered in its first years as the price of pollution permits collapsed.
  ''We have seen difficulties in various pilot provinces in compliance and accuracy measures about emissions,'' said Wang Tao, a resident scholar in the Energy and Climate Program based at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing.
  In his second term, Mr. Obama has taken on climate change without Congress. Using his executive authority, he worked with the E.P.A. on a series of regulations, which the E.P.A. finalized last month, requiring electric utilities to sharply limit carbon pollution. Ultimately, the regulations could lead to the shutdown of hundreds of coal-fired power plants.
  Republicans assailed the rules as an abuse of executive authority, a top-down fiat -- not unlike what might be seen in China.

Misinformation about climate change is distressingly common in the United States -- a 2014 Yale study found that 35 percent of Americans believe that global warming is caused mostly by natural phenomena rather than human activity, and 34 percent think there is a lot of disagreement among scientists about whether global warming is even happening. (In fact, an overwhelming majority of scientists agree that climate change is here and that it is caused by humans.) One way to stop the spread of this misinformation is to teach children about climate change.
The Next Generation Science Standards offer one guide for doing so. Developed by a committee of scientists and education experts and honed by teams in 26 states before their release in 2013, the standards set forth a variety of scientific practices and concepts for students from kindergarten through 12th grade to master. 
  Middle school students should understand that ''human activities, such as the release of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, are major factors in the current rise in Earth's mean surface temperature.'' In high school, students should learn that human-caused environmental changes, including climate change, ''can disrupt an ecosystem and threaten the survival of some species,'' and they should be able to use climate models to determine the rate of climate change and its possible effects.
  Fifteen states, including New Jersey, California and Kentucky, have adopted the standards, as have about 40 school districts in other states. Some states that have yet to adopt them, including New York, already have standards that incorporate climate change. In September, Alabama adopted standards that differ from the Next Generation Science Standards but still require students to understand how humans contribute to changes in climate.
  Other states continue to debate the issue.
  In Tennessee, for example, new science standards now under review call for high school students to ''analyze data linking human activity to climate change'' and to ''design solutions to address human impacts on climate change.'' At the seventh-grade level, however, they require students to use data ''to engage in argument the role that human activities play in global climate change.'' That standard appears to be in line with Tennessee's 2012 law allowing teachers to help students ''review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of existing scientific theories.'' That law was widely seen as supporting the teaching of evolution and climate change as controversies rather than as settled science.
  Children today stand to inherit a climate severely changed by the actions of previous generations. They need to understand how those changes came about, how to mitigate them and how to prevent more damage to the planet. Schools can start by adopting science standards that deal extensively with human-caused climate change and that accurately reflect the scientific consensus.

Here’s what you need to know.
(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)
Good morning.
We’re covering the U.S.-China rivalry at the U.N., the United Kingdom’s new virus restrictions and the certainty of decades of climate disasters.
Britain at a ‘perilous turning point,’ Johnson says
Taking an uncharacteristically somber tone, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain announced new virus-related restrictions on Tuesday that could stay in place for the next six months and said that the country had reached a “perilous turning point” in the pandemic.
“This is the moment when we must act,” Mr. Johnson said. He described the new measures as a “stitch in time to save nine” — a targeted effort that could avert more blunt-force restrictions down the road.
Mr. Johnson has been widely blamed for missteps that have worsened the pandemic in Britain, which has the highest death toll in Europe — more than 52,000, by one government count — including delaying the order of a lockdown in March, when cases and deaths were soaring.
Across the aisle: In his first major address since becoming the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer took aim at Mr. Johnson’s handling of the crisis, denouncing him as “just not up to the job” and saying a second national lockdown would be a “sign of government failure.”
In other developments:
• The death toll in the U.S. from the coronavirus has now exceeded 200,000 — more deaths than in any other country.
• This year’s Nobel Peace Prize ceremony has been canceled because of the pandemic.
• Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand apologized after being photographed with supporters without social distancing or wearing masks last week while on the campaign trail.
China-U.S. feud on display at the U.N. General Assembly
The presidents of the United States and China squared off in their Tuesday speeches to the annual General Assembly on the coronavirus, global warming, human rights, international cooperation and a range of other issues, punctuating a superpower rivalry that the leader of the 193-member United Nations, Secretary-General António Guterres, has called a great global risk.
Meanwhile, a push by Mike Pompeo, the U.S. secretary of state, to prioritize religious liberty and property rights has gained little traction among the U.S.’s European allies, who cite concerns that it could come at the expense of protecting marginalized groups.
Recap: The United Nations is marking its 75th anniversary this year against a backdrop of multiple crises. Because of the pandemic, none of the leaders have traveled to the New York headquarters to deliver their addresses. The speeches are being delivered via prerecorded videos.
Decades of climate disasters are now inevitable
The cascading climate disasters that dominate headlines and disrupt lives — drought in the American West fueling historic wildfires that send smoke all the way to the East Coast, or tropical storms lining up across the Atlantic to march destructively toward North America — are no longer features of some dystopian future. They are the here and now, worsening for the next generation and perhaps longer, depending on humanity’s willingness to take action.
The Times spoke to two dozen experts who said decisions made now would spell the difference between a difficult future and something far worse. “It’s as if we’ve been smoking a pack of cigarettes a day for decades” and the world is now feeling the effects, said one climate scientist.
Reset: Managing climate change, experts said, will require rethinking virtually every aspect of daily life, including home construction and power grids — and a large shift in politics in the United States, which has largely ignored climate change.
Political angle: Liberal activist donors have begun a campaign to pressure Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, to reject advisers with any ties to fossil fuel companies.
If you have 8 minutes, this is worth it
The prisoners who held up the Afghan peace talks
A young Afghan police officer killed two U.S. Marines in 2011, and although he did not appear to be acting on behalf of the Taliban, the insurgent group demanded his release from prison. Mohammad Dawood, the officer, was one of just six prisoners — out of 5,000 released by the Afghan government — over whom a bitter disagreement almost derailed peace talks this month. Above, delegates in Doha, Qatar, on Sept. 12.
The U.S., France and Australia lobbied against the release of the six men, who had killed their citizens. Our reporters looked at Mr. Dawood’s case, which demonstrates the tough choices involved in trying to make peace in the middle of a bitter war.
Here’s what else is happening
Ruth Bader Ginsburg: A vote in the U.S. Senate on President Trump’s nominee to replace the late Supreme Court justice looks all but certain after Senator Mitt Romney said he supported moving forward to fill her seat.
Facebook: The social network said it had taken down fake pages created in China that were aimed at influencing the U.S. presidential election, both for and against Mr. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.
National Trust: Nearly 100 properties managed by the revered British conservation society have direct connections to slavery and colonialism, it said in a report.
Euthanasia: As governments around the world consider allowing the ending of lives to relieve suffering, the Vatican reiterated its opposition to assisted suicide and euthanasia, which it called “intrinsically evil” acts, “in every situation or circumstance.”
Snapshot: Above, rescuers in Tasmania working to bring a pilot whale back to safety. More than 450 of the whales somehow ended up stranded on a beach in the Australian state. Whale beachings are not uncommon in Tasmania, but this one is among the worst. Most of the whales are believed to have died.
Lives lived: Betty Bushman, one of baseball’s first female sportscasters, whose brief 1964 tenure was a ploy to interest more women in the Kansas City Athletics, died at 89 this month.
What we’re listening to: This Radiolab episode about falling. “For someone who has a fear of falling, an hour of listening about great falls — including Niagara Falls, myths about cats and love — makes the world seem a little less scary,” writes Remy Tumin of the Briefings team.
Now, a break from the news

And now for the Back Story on …
The faces of climate migration
Between now and 2070, the portion of our planet that is a barely livable hot zone could go from 1 percent to 19 percent, displacing huge numbers of people. Within the United States alone, according to one projection, at least 13 million people will have to move by 2100 because of climate change.
The photojournalist Meridith Kohut documents humanitarian issues. For a series on global human migration in the The New York Times Magazine, she captured families and workers facing this reality. In this edited Times Insider interview, she talked about the assignment.
Having first photographed this story around Latin America, how different was it photographing in the United States?
I’ve covered humanitarian crises internationally for over a decade, and this year is one of the first times I’ve ever worked covering my home country. You think America is more insulated from the devastation of climate change, but the past year has shown me that that’s just not true.
Looking through your photos, there’s a kind of sweetness to some of them. What was your approach?
The story is data-driven, and Abrahm Lustgarten had already finished writing it before I started working on the photographs. My job was to humanize the data — to go out and tell the stories of the people living with what the data shows. My approach was to try to document the emotional toll it takes on people who lose their homes, the seniors who spend their days just trying to survive the heat, and hopefully do it in a way that touches our readers’ hearts and inspire them to take action to help reduce carbon emissions and mitigate climate change.
With weather being such a factor in making your job easier or harder, what kinds of challenges were you encountering?
My cameras got utterly and completely filthy. We were right up on the fireline at multiple fires, and it was raining ash. It was very hot, and the thick smoke made it hard to breathe at times, and burned my eyes and throat.
I drove into Hurricane Laura at dawn, a few hours after it made landfall. The hotel The New York Times had booked for me was destroyed, so I slept in my truck for days. My editor felt really bad about it, but after over a decade living and working in Venezuela I’m pretty used to challenging field conditions. “Oh my gosh, you had to sleep in your truck!” she said. “Are you kidding?” I responded, “I was in a Walmart parking lot! It was so nice!”
That’s it for today’s briefing. Thanks for starting your day with The Times.

Judge Amy Coney Barrett refused to answer numerous questions, but it was her avoidance of acknowledging climate change that particularly resonated.
During two grueling days of questioning over her Supreme Court confirmation, Judge Amy Coney Barrett did her best to avoid controversy. But her efforts to play it safe on the subject of climate change have created perhaps the most tangible backlash of her hearings. 
  In her responses, the nominee to take the place of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an environmental stalwart, used language that alarmed some environmentalists and suggested rough going for initiatives to fight climate change, if as expected she wins confirmation and cements a 6-3 conservative majority on the court.
  On Thursday, the last of four days of confirmation hearings, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee set a committee vote on Judge Barrett's nomination for Oct. 22 hoping to speed a final vote to as soon as Oct. 26 -- one week and a day before Election Day.
  As she did on judicial matters, such as her views on Roe v. Wade, Judge Barrett declined to state her thoughts on climate change in exchange after exchange this week, equating her evasions to the well-established precedent of refusing to comment on issues that could come before the court.
  But with Senator Kamala Harris of California, the Democratic candidate for vice president, Judge Barrett, the daughter of an oil executive, went further. She described the settled science of climate change as still in dispute, compared to Ms. Harris's other examples, including whether smoking causes cancer and the coronavirus is infectious.
  ''Do you believe that climate change is happening and threatening the air we breathe and the water that we drink?'' Ms. Harris asked.
  Judge Barrett responded, ''You asked me uncontroversial questions, like Covid-19 being infectious or if smoking causes cancer'' to solicit ''an opinion from me on a very contentious matter of public debate,'' climate change.
  ''I will not do that,'' Judge Barrett concluded. ''I will not express a view on a matter of public policy, especially one that is politically controversial.''
  Republicans showed no sign of discomfort with that answer. But her performance raised alarm bells around the world. Greta Thunberg, the young Swedish climate activist, took to Twitter to quip, ''To be fair, I don't have any 'views on climate change' either. Just like I don't have any 'views' on gravity, the fact that the earth is round, photosynthesis nor evolution.''
  ''But,'' she continued, ''understanding and knowing their existence really makes life in the 21st century so much easier.''
  Michael Gerrard, the founder of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University Law School, said her ''non-answer on global warming'' does not necessarily put her in the climate denial camp; it could have been ''reflexive stonewalling.'' But, he said, ''it's driven people up the wall.''
  It was not just the exchange with Ms. Harris. On Tuesday, in a friendlier give-and-take with Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, Judge Barrett fell back on the excuse that ''I'm certainly not a scientist,'' when asked her views on a warming planet. That might sound bland, but it closely tracks the language used by Republican lawmakers who oppose action on climate change or deny the science outright.
  And stating ''I would not say I have firm views on it'' in the face of so much evidence of climate change in daily life, as Judge Barrett did, is controversial.
  ''She's a smart and sophisticated person,'' said Richard L. Revesz, director of the institute for policy integrity at New York University Law School. ''If she didn't want to associate herself with the climate denial perspective, she could have used different words.''
  White House spokesman Judd Deere, in response to questions about Judge Barrett's two days of hearings, said, ''During her 20-plus hours of testimony, Judge Barrett made clear what she committed to the American people the day she was nominated: 'Judges are not policymakers.'''
  Judge Barrett's insistence that she has no opinion on climate change places her within a small and shrinking minority of Americans. Today, 73 percent of Americans say that global warming is happening, and 62 percent of Americans accept that it is human caused. A decade ago, 57 percent accepted that climate. change was happening. Only 20 percent of Americans say they fit the ''I don't know'' category.
  And it was not at all clear why she insisted on not answering whether climate change was real, said Ann Carlson, who is a director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the U.C.L.A. School of Law. Professor Carlson said Judge Barrett implied that stating a scientific fact could somehow be prejudicial to future high court deliberations, yet she was willing to state other obvious facts that have borne on litigation, such as cigarette smoking causes cancer.
  Alex Flint, a former senior Republican Senate aide who was involved with more than 70 federal government confirmations, said he understood Judge Barrett's actions. ''None of the Democrats are going to support her, regardless of how she answers the question,'' he said, so her answer was crafted to ensure she did not alienate the Republican senators she needs.
  However, Mr. Flint, who now leads a Republican group to address climate change, the Alliance for Market Solutions, added that her response on climate may look like smart politics today, but it is not necessarily good for the future of the party, which needs ''to build credibility, especially with young and college educated voters whose role in elections is growing.''
  A Justice Barrett could have real effects on efforts to address climate change.
  The prior jurisprudence is clear. In the 2007 case Massachusetts v. the Environmental Protection Agency, the Supreme Court declared that greenhouse gases are covered under the Clean Air Act and that the agency can act to counter climate change. In 2009, the E.P.A. issued what is known as the ''endangerment finding,'' which said that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. That finding was challenged in the courts and survived: the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the finding in 2012, and the Supreme Court declined to review the lower court's decision, allowing it to stand.
  If President Trump were to win a second term, Professor Revesz said, the government could withdraw the endangerment finding, and the inevitable court challenge could bring the fundamental question of climate change back before the Supreme Court.
  There is also the question of how Judge Barrett would approach regulatory matters. Professor Carlson suggested that Judge Barrett would seek to interpret the E.P.A.'s powers narrowly. Other conservative members of the Supreme Court have indicated a willingness to revive a legal doctrine that holds that Congress should not give regulatory agencies much leeway in executing policies. With six votes, the conservative bloc could tie the hands of regulators.
  ''The future of the administrative state, in many respects, is on the line -- and her refusal to answer basic questions about things like climate science makes me worry that we could see a whole dismantling of agencies that we have come to rely on for environmental protection,'' she said.
  Limits on administrative power would leave Congress with the task of being much more specific in drafting environmental legislation, Professor Gerrard said. ''A very specific, well crafted law by Congress would be very hard for the courts to get around,'' he said. Yet narrowly crafted laws don't always adapt well to changing circumstances, as the years pass.
  Leaving statutes vague, however, has been a way for Congress to finesse fights. A demand for specificity would make passage of environmental legislation even harder than it is now.
  Judge Barrett's family has strong ties to the fossil fuel industry.
  Her father, Michael E. Coney, worked as a prominent attorney at Shell Oil in New Orleans and Houston for 29 years, from 1978 to 2007, focusing on deep sea exploration and drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf. As part of his work, he represented the oil and gas giant before the federal government, frequently dealing with the Department of Interior on royalties, regulations and compliance issues.
  Mr. Coney was also an active member of the powerful oil and gas trade organization, the American Petroleum Institute, twice serving as chairman of its Subcommittee on Exploration and Production Law. On top of being the industry's main lobby group, A.P.I. has played a critical role in casting doubt on climate science and opposing policies to address climate change.
  Judge Barrett has previously recused herself from cases involving four Shell entities related to her father's work. She has not recused herself from matters involving the A.P.I.
  Stephen Gillers, a professor at the New York University School of Law, said Judge Barrett was likely exercising an abundance of caution in recusing herself from cases involving her father's former employer. She would need to recuse herself, he said, if her father was ever a party to, or an acting lawyer on, a case before her -- unlikely scenarios now that her father has retired. She would also need to recuse herself if a case required the court to evaluate or critique her father's case work, which could mean he would have an interest in being exonerated, or having his work found appropriate, Professor Gillers said.
  ''Her father's close identification with Shell and A.P.I. alone is simply not enough to require recusal from the industry,'' he said.
  To Carlos Curbelo, a former Republican member of Congress who supports action on climate change, the focus on Judge Barrett's comments misses a broader point that the courts are not the proper venue for dealing with a problem as vast and complex as climate.
  ''Because Congress has been so dysfunctional for so many years, now we look to the courts,'' Mr. Curbelo, ''but we should be far more concerned with lawmakers and their understanding of the issue and willingness to act.''

Highlight: Trump cabinet nominees offer a more nuanced view of climate change: The Earth is warming, but the impact of human activities remains uncertain.


Body


Not long ago, many Republican officeholders had a simple answer when asked about the changing climate: What changing climate?
But the public began to notice the heat waves and the            torrential rains and the            tidal flooding. So then we had the “I am not a scientist” phase, with one lawmaker after another fending off climate questions with that formula.
That drew such ridicule that Republicans critical of climate science had to come up with a more nuanced answer. Several variations on the new approach were on display recently during confirmation hearings for some of President Trump’s cabinet nominees.
“Science tells us that the climate is changing and human activity in some manner impacts that change,” Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general nominated to run the Environmental Protection Agency, told a Senate committee. “The human ability to measure with precision the extent of that impact is subject to continuing debate and dialogue, as well they should be.”
Let us ponder the craftsmanship of that second sentence.
“With precision” is the key phrase, of course, and it renders the statement almost axiomatically true. Do we have trouble taking the precise temperature of an entire planet and then divining, for a given period, exactly how much of the change in that temperature is caused by human activities?
Well, yes.
Anybody who did not know better might come away thinking there is room to doubt whether humans are the main cause of global warming. Mr. Pruitt did not actually say that, of course — nowadays, hard-core climate denial provokes a furious response from Democrats in Congress and mild protest even from a few Republicans.
Thus Mr. Pruitt and the other Trump nominees labored to avoid overt denial while signaling to their allies that there is enough doubt to justify inaction on emissions or even rolling back steps the Obama administration took.
“They’re just trying not to look crazy, because if they look too crazy, then Susan Collins” — a Republican senator from Maine — “and a few of the moderate Republicans might jump ship,” said Raymond T. Pierrehumbert, an American climate scientist who holds a chair at Oxford University, in Britain.
In interviews, Dr. Pierrehumbert and several other experts said the public should not be fooled. The deep consensus among climate scientists, arrived at through decades of research, is that human activity is the cause of most of the planetary warming of recent decades, and probably all of it.
What is the evidence?
For starters, an unassailable body of physics tells us that if you add carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, they will trap extra heat near the surface of the planet, a prediction so basic it was first made in the 19th century.
“People have been trying, but nobody has really shaken the foundations of the theory in all that time,” Dr. Pierrehumbert said.
Emissions have soared in the modern era, and as predicted, the Earth is heating up. That would be obvious just from all the land ice that is melting, but of course, we have had thermometers for centuries now. They show that the Earth has warmed roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century, a large number for the surface of a planet.
With just those facts, you have a powerful circumstantial case that human activities are the cause of global warming. But we have more: Sophisticated computer analyses of the climate confirm it, finding that no factor other than the human release of greenhouse gases is large enough to explain the recent warming.
What are the soft spots in the theory?
The biggest is that natural factors could in principle be causing the climate to change, as Mr. Pruitt implied. Suppose, for example, that the sun were to start putting out a lot more radiation; that would definitely warm the Earth.
But we have satellites keeping a close eye on the sun, and it has not changed nearly enough to be the culprit. Scientists have looked closely at all the possible natural factors, in fact, and they are not adequate to explain the warming.
“Of all the natural drivers, and everything we know that works on long time scales that has ever affected climate in the past, all those things have been ruled out,” said Drew Shindell, an atmospheric scientist at Duke University. “Beyond a reasonable doubt, it has to be human activities.”
The most important uncertainties are not really about the cause of global warming — we are the cause — but in trying to forecast how big the coming changes will be.
If emissions continue at a high level but the Earth turns out to be less sensitive to greenhouse gases than currently believed, that would give humanity a few extra decades to come to grips with the situation. But it is not a get-out-of-jail-free card: If we keep burning fossil fuels in that time, scientists say the planet will still undergo profound, threatening changes.
On the other hand, if the Earth turns out to be especially sensitive to the gases and if we permit runaway emissions growth, some research suggests that huge parts of the world could eventually get so hot as to be uninhabitable by large mammals.
Recall that the large mammals include human beings. “People tend to think of climate change as not being of the same magnitude as nuclear warfare, but at the high end, it’s arguably worse,” Dr. Pierrehumbert said.
So, despite some genuine uncertainties, the risks are extraordinary, and the moral case for action is pretty clear: We have to get to zero emissions, the sooner the better. Mr. Trump’s nominees have so far displayed scant willingness to come to grips with that.
Perhaps surprisingly, though, the congressional hearings did offer glimmers of hope.
Rex W. Tillerson, who won confirmation on Wednesday as Mr. Trump’s secretary of state, implied that he might try to keep the nation committed to a big international deal on climate change reached in Paris in 2015.
But the most interesting statements came from Rick Perry, Mr. Trump’s nominee to head the Department of Energy. Under questioning, Mr. Perry, the former Texas governor, was surprisingly positive about the role the federal government might play in developing advanced clean-energy technology.
Many people — Bill Gates among them — see this as the most urgent issue. Renewable energy and greater use of natural gas are helping lower emissions in the short run, but if we do not invest heavily in research and development now, we may not have the technology we will eventually need to get to zero emissions.
People like Mr. Gates and the entrepreneur Elon Musk are working on Mr. Trump. If the president’s mind is really open on global warming, as he said after the election, perhaps he could also sit down with a few of our brightest climate scientists.
“If we always have to go back and debate the facts, we’re never going to get to the solutions,” said Ken Caldeira, a California climate expert who has helped to educate Mr. Gates. “Can’t we at least start with the facts and go from there?”

Highlight: Decades of diplomatic efforts to stem global warming have proven ineffectual because too many strategies have been taken off the table.


Body


In 1988, when world leaders convened their first global conference on climate change, in Toronto, the Earth’s average temperature was a bit more than half a degree Celsius above the average of the last two decades of the 19th century,            according to measurements by NASA.
Global emissions of greenhouse gases amounted to the equivalent of some 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year — excluding those from deforestation and land use. Worried about its accumulation, the gathered scientists and policymakers called on the world to cut CO2 emissions by a fifth.
That didn’t happen, of course. By 1997, when climate diplomats from the world’s leading nations gathered to negotiate a round of emissions cuts in Kyoto, Japan, emissions had risen to some 35 billion tons and the global surface temperature was roughly 0.7 of a degree Celsius above the average of the late 19th century.
It took almost two decades for the next breakthrough. When diplomats from virtually every country gathered in Paris just over two years ago to hash out another agreement to combat climate change, the world’s surface temperature was already about 1.1 degrees Celsius above its average at the end of the 1800s. And greenhouse gas emissions            totaled just under 50 billion tons.
This is not to belittle diplomacy. Maybe this is the best we can do. How can countries be persuaded to adopt expensive strategies to drop fossil fuels when the prospective impact of climate change remains uncertain and fixing the problem requires collective action? As mitigation by an individual country will benefit all, nations will be tempted to take a free ride on the efforts of others. And no country will be able to solve the problem on its own.
Still, the world’s diplomatic meanderings — from the ineffectual call in Toronto for a reduction in emissions to the summit meeting in Paris, where each country was allowed simply to pledge whatever it could to the global effort — suggest that the diplomats, policymakers and environmentalists trying to slow climate change still cannot cope with its unforgiving math. They are, instead, trying to ignore it. And that will definitely not work.
The world is still warming. Both NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported last week that global temperatures last year receded slightly from the record-setting 2016, because there was no El Niño heating up the Pacific.
While the world frets over President Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement, I would argue that the greatest impediment to slowing this relentless warming is an illusion of progress that is allowing every country to sidestep many of the hard choices that still must be made.
“We keep doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome,” said Scott Barrett, an expert on international cooperation and coordination at Columbia University who was once a lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Climate diplomats in Paris didn’t merely reassert prior commitments to keep the world’s temperature less than 2 degrees above that of the “preindustrial” era — a somewhat fuzzy term that could be taken to mean the second half of the 19th century. Hoping to appease island nations like the Maldives, which are likely to be swallowed by a rising ocean in a few decades, they set a new “aspirational” ceiling of 1.5 degrees.
To stick to a 2-degree limit, we would have to start reducing global emissions for real within about a decade at most — and then do more. Half a century from now, we would have to figure out how to suck vast amounts of carbon out of the air. Keeping the lid at 1.5 degrees would be much harder still.
Yet when experts tallied the offers made in Paris by all the countries in the collective effort, they concluded that greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 would exceed the level needed to remain under 2 degrees by 12 billion to 14 billion tons of CO2.
Are there better approaches? The “climate club” proposed by the Yale University economist William Nordhaus has the advantage of including an enforcement device, which current arrangements lack: Countries in the club, committed to reducing carbon emissions, would impose a tariff on imports from nonmembers to encourage them to join.
Martin Weitzman of Harvard University supports the idea of a uniform worldwide tax on carbon emissions, which might be easier to agree on than a panoply of national emissions cuts. One clear advantage is that countries could use their tax revenues as they saw fit.
Mr. Barrett argues that the Paris agreement could be supplemented with narrower, simpler deals to curb emissions of particular gases — such as the 2016 agreement at a 170-nation meeting in Kigali, Rwanda, to reduce hydrofluorocarbon emissions — or in particular industries, like aviation or steel.
Maybe none of this would work. The climate club could blow up if nonmembers retaliated against import tariffs by imposing trade barriers of their own. Coordinating taxes around the world looks at least as difficult as addressing climate change. And Mr. Barrett’s proposal might not deliver a breakthrough on the scale necessary to move the dial.
But what definitely won’t suffice is a climate strategy built out of wishful thinking: the proposition that countries can be cajoled and prodded into increasing their ambition to cut emissions further, and that laggards can be named and shamed into falling into line.
Inveigled by three decades of supposed diplomatic progress — coupled with falling prices of wind turbines, solar panels and batteries — the activists, technologists and policymakers driving the strategy against climate change seem to have concluded that the job can be done without unpalatable choices. And the group is closing doors that it would do best to keep open.
There is no momentum for investing in carbon capture and storage, since it could be seen as condoning the continued use of fossil fuels. Nuclear energy, the only source of low-carbon power ever deployed at the needed scale, is also anathema. Geoengineering, like pumping aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect the sun’s heat back into space, is another taboo.
But eventually, these options will most likely be on the table, as the consequences of climate change come more sharply into focus. The rosy belief that the world can reduce its carbon dependency over a few decades by relying exclusively on the power of shame, the wind and the sun will give way to a more realistic understanding of possibilities.
Some set of countries will decide to forget Paris and deploy a few jets to pump sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere to cool the world temporarily. There will be a race to develop techniques to harvest and store carbon from the atmosphere, and another to build nuclear generators at breakneck speed.
It will probably be too late to prevent the Maldives from ending up underwater. But better late than never.

New Mexico Wavered on Evolution and Climate Change in Science Education

Highlight: The state’s Education Department unveiled a proposal that used soft language on evolution and climate change. Then came the public outcry.


Body


Correction Appended
An apparent attempt to water down language about evolution and climate change in the guidelines for science education in New Mexico met with protests this week at an eventful public hearing at the Public Education Department’s offices in Santa Fe.
Hundreds of people — some of them demonstrating outside with signs — showed up to the event. The meeting lasted for hours, well past its noon deadline. At one point, someone interrupted the proceedings by setting off a fire alarm.
The attendants overwhelmingly called for officials to include evolution and climate change in proposed standards that would guide science education for public school students. That was on Monday, and it appears the New Mexico Public Education Department heard their complaints; on Tuesday, it announced that it would incorporate the public’s suggestions.
But some say that still wasn’t enough.
All of this began last month, when the state’s education department unveiled a proposal to update its standards for science education for students in kindergarten through 12th grade.
It borrowed language from the Next Generation Science Standards, a set of education guidelines that was released in 2013. (The standards, meant to be adopted — or at least adapted — by state-level education departments, were developed by a consortium of states and some national organizations like the National Research Council and the National Science Teachers Association.)
But there were some notable differences between those standards and the ones that ended up in New Mexico’s original proposal. As Mother Jones reported last month, a mention of “the rise in global temperatures” was changed to: “the fluctuation in global temperatures.” A reference to “4.6 billion years” as the approximate age of the earth was erased. So was at least one mention of “evolution,” though other references to it remained.
Suddenly, the rather bureaucratic process of updating educational standards became a hot-button issue, one with statewide implications for political discourse and religious freedom. “It’s the latest battlefield in an ongoing war about to what extent we’re actually going to let children learn about what scientists say about climate change,” said Glenn Branch, the deputy director of the National Center for Science Education.
New Mexico’s two senators, Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich, both Democrats, wrote in an article on Medium last month that they were “disturbed” by the original language in the proposal. “If we weaken our science standards to advance an ideological agenda at the expense of scientific facts, we will put New Mexico at a distinct disadvantage,” they said.
Eileen Everett, the executive director of the Environmental Education Association of New Mexico, was at the public hearing on Monday. She said her organization, a nonprofit that promotes environmental education, has been pushing state officials to adopt the Next Generation Science Standards because New Mexico’s existing science education guidelines have not been updated since 2003.
“One thing our organization has said since the beginning of this is that science is science,” she said. “And evolution and climate change — using terms like that is rooted in science.”
Ms. Everett said she was happy that so many members of the public had come in person to Monday’s hearing, and that the public education department responded so quickly with revisions.
But as of Friday, the revised language still deviated from the Next Generation Science standards a little bit, according to analysis from the Environmental Education Association. For instance, a line about middle school students using pictures to study embryonic development has been scrubbed.
And a line about high school students using computers to show the changing “relationships among earth systems” omits the phrase: “due to human activity.”
The proposal, which was to take effect next year, has not been finalized yet. It is unclear whether there will be further changes.
Climate change has become a politically charged issue, but a majority of scientists, as well as governmental and scientific organizations like            NASA, the            American Meteorological Society and the            Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change agree that warming temperatures are existentially dangerous and caused by humans.
The theory of evolution is supported overwhelmingly by scientific consensus, but some people who believe in intelligent design claim that the theory is fundamentally flawed, and that the earth is thousands of years old rather than billions.
The Public Department of Education did not respond to questions about why the language about evolution and climate change was watered down in the first place.
“Our goal in holding a public hearing is to ensure all those who wanted to discuss these proposed standards would be heard,” said Christopher Ruszkowski, the state’s education secretary, in a statement on Wednesday. “We have listened to the thoughtful input received and will incorporate many of the suggestions into the New Mexico Standards.”
Mr. Branch of the National Center for Science Education said the proposed standards “remain inadequate” even after changes were made this week, and he questioned officials’ transparency on the issue.
“The origin of the changes is mysterious,” he said, adding that Mr. Ruszkowski “has been very vague about the source of the changes, and public records requests have met with stonewalling from the department.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about guidelines for science education in New Mexico misstated part of the name of a group that studies climate change. It is the Intergovernmental — not International — Panel on Climate Change.

Body


Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox.
This week, we devoted the Climate Fwd: newsletter to what we eat, and, as climate editor at The New York Times, I’m excited to bring you a special collaboration between The Times’s climate and food teams. 
Every week in this newsletter, we invite you to send us your climate questions, and many of the ones we receive are about food. So, we did something big to answer them: We joined with our colleagues in the food section to bring you information about how to shop, cook and eat in a warming world.
We generally have options about what to eat every day, and those choices have climate consequences. About a quarter of all planet-warming greenhouse gases emitted each year are a result of how we feed the world. Does what you eat have an effect on climate change? The answer is yes, absolutely.
We wanted to give you something comprehensive, something that could help answer the big questions about how what you eat intersects with climate change. Here it is:
We also wanted to make this personal, because our food choices are incredibly personal. Wondering how the climate effects of your own diet compare with those of other Americans? Nadja Popovich made a quiz for you, to calculate the climate impact of the foods most similar to what you ate for breakfast, lunch and dinner yesterday. (Be honest!)
And we wanted to offer you the riches of cuisines that are delicious and have smaller carbon footprints than an average American meal. Somini Sengupta shows you five ways to eat sustainably, using examples from traditional cuisines around the world.
We have recipes from the experts at NYT Cooking (subscription required) to help you with            sustainable seafood and            weeknight vegan dinners. We have recipes for all kinds of            bean and lentil dinners and for            delicious grains.
Sam Sifton, the food editor at the Times (sign up for his Cooking newsletter here), said, “It was so obvious we needed to do this. The science, after all, is clear. The climate is changing. And a lot of home cooks have been left paralyzed at the stove or in the marketplace as a result, choosing between the farmed salmon and the pasture-raised chicken, the organic tofu, the fair-trade coffee, the heritage carrots. Which is best or safest for the environment? Which hurts it the least? What, in general, are we supposed to buy and cook, if we want to help reduce our carbon footprints, the carbon footprints of our nation, our world?”
We hope you find this special collaboration between climate and food reporters useful, because it’s part of our mission here at The Times to help readers understand the world. Let us know what you think, or if we missed any burning questions, at climateteam@nytimes.com.
Happy reading. We hope you find something inspiring to cook and eat.

Highlight: In every region, farmers and scientists are trying to adapt an array of crops to warmer temperatures, invasive pests, erratic weather and earlier growing seasons.


Body


The impact may not yet be obvious in grocery stores and greenmarkets, but behind the organic apples and bags of rice and cans of cherry pie filling are hundreds of thousands of farmers, plant breeders and others in agriculture who are scrambling to keep up with climate change.
Drop a pin anywhere on a map of the United States and you’ll find disruption in the fields. Warmer temperatures are extending growing seasons in some areas and sending a host of new pests into others. Some fields are parched with drought, others so flooded that they swallow tractors. 
Decades-long patterns of frost, heat and rain — never entirely predictable but once reliable enough — have broken down. In regions where the term climate change still meets with skepticism, some simply call the weather extreme or erratic. But most agree that something unusual is happening. 
[Tell us how climate change is affecting your area.]
“Farming is no different than gambling,” said Sarah Frey, whose collection of farms throughout the South and the Midwest grows much of the nation’s crop of watermelons and pumpkins. “You’re putting thousands if not millions of dollars into the earth and hoping nothing catastrophic happens, but it’s so much more of a gamble now. You have all of these consequences that farmers weren’t expecting.”
Because the system required to feed the country is complex and intertwined, a two- or three-week shift in a growing season can upset supply chains, labor schedules and even the hidden mechanics of agriculture, like the routes that honeybees travel to pollinate fields. Higher temperatures and altered growing seasons are making new crops possible in places where they weren’t before, but that same heat is also hurting traditional crops. Early rains, unexpected droughts and late freezes leave farmers uncertain over what comes next.
Here are 11 everyday foods, from all over the country, that are facing big changes:
Tart cherries
Weather has always been a challenge in northern Michigan, but never — at least as far back as tart-cherry growers can remember — has it been this frustrating. Tart cherries are a small, delicate crop that bakers prefer to use fresh for pies, although most are frozen, dried or processed into juice or canned filling. Growers rely on a long, cold winter and a slow, cool spring so trees won’t bud and bloom before the threat of a final freeze is over. But lately, Grand Traverse Bay hasn’t been freezing over reliably, so warmer temperatures arrive too soon. There have been two total crop failures in a decade; the last one before that was in 1945. Spring weather has become more violent, too, pummeling trees with hail and winds.
The spotted wing Drosophila, an invasive fruit fly, showed up in 2010, and many farmers believe it is spreading quickly as a result of shifting climate patterns. It lays eggs in the fruit, and its larvae feed inside, ruining the cherry; so far it seems impossible to control. A team of researchers is trying to develop a cherry tree that blooms 20 days later, but with fruit that ripens at the same time as it does now. Still, a solution is years away. That may be too late for some of the 425 families who grow tart cherries. Already, there is talk among some families of abandoning the cherry business altogether, said            Nikki Rothwell, coordinator of the Northwest Michigan Horticultural Research Center. “The stress is becoming too much for many of the growers,” she said.
Organic raspberries
The fruit fly that is vexing cherry growers in Michigan is also attacking the raspberry crop in New York State. Winters haven’t been as long or as cold, so the flies are appearing earlier; organic fruit are especially at risk because farmers are limited in using pesticides. Unlike other flies that feed on rotting fruit, the spotted wing Drosophila, which by 2011 had arrived in significant numbers in upstate New York, has a tiny saw near its abdomen that allows it to cut into fruit that is just ready to be picked. The raspberries, already delicate, can end up infested with larvae, and turn to goo by the time a customer gets them home. 
Couple that with mild winters that don’t kill off pests, and unusual weather patterns that don’t bring rain when they should — or bring so much that farmers can’t get into the fields to work or have to battle fungus — and organic berries aren’t such a good bet anymore. “People have really given up on raspberries on a lot of farms,” said Alissa White, a researcher at the University of Vermont who tracks the impact of climate change on Northeastern farms. “Farmers are the kings of risk management. Once every 10 or 20 years we could lose a crop. But if once every three or four, that’s a lot.”
Watermelons
Warmer weather and an increasingly earlier growing season have, in many ways, been good for farmers like Sarah Frey. She used to start harvesting her South Florida watermelons in mid-April. This year, crews were picking in March. She’ll be picking earlier in South Georgia, and expects to pull watermelons from fields in Missouri by the Fourth of July, which she said was rare when she was growing up in the 1990s.
But earlier and longer growing seasons have consequences. For Ms. Frey, harvesting watermelons earlier than usual puts her into competition with the late-winter crop from Mexico. And new, more restrictive immigration policies could mean she won’t have enough workers from Mexico to work the fields when she needs them — especially because many American produce growers are starting or expanding operations in Mexico. “Having it earlier is good for customers and good for business, but if it’s overlapping with the import business and I can’t get enough workers to harvest, that’s a problem,” she said.
Chickpeas
The chickpea is enjoying an unexpected assist from extreme weather. Farmers in Montana, who grow about 60 percent of the chickpeas produced in the United States, are being encouraged to plant more as a hedge against heat and drought. The average annual temperature in Montana has increased by 2.4 degrees over the last century, but the amount of rain hasn’t changed much. 
Chickpeas, which need less water to grow than wheat and other cereal grains that are the mainstay of Montana agriculture, provide an antidote. They improve soil and help reduce the need for fertilizer; rotating in a spring crop of chickpeas before a wheat crop can help break disease and pest cycles, said Kevin McPhee, a professor at Montana State University. It also doesn’t hurt that hummus is so popular, opening up new markets. Still, all the new chickpea growers face tough competition globally. India, which imports huge amounts of American chickpeas, protected its own producers with stiff tariffs in 2018, and China and the European Union have responded to recent United States trade tariffs with their own.
Wild Blueberries
The wild blueberry has long been an essential player in Maine agriculture, but unpredictable weather is challenging the 44,000 acres where the commercial low-bush berries grow. The season has stretched out four weeks longer, and summers are becoming warmer. Temperatures last year reached an unprecedented 95 degrees, said Lily Calderwood, an extension wild blueberry specialist at the University of Maine.
Frosts are becoming erratic, too. A frost in the spring can kill blossoms that would have become fruit. “We didn’t used to have these unpredictable events,” Dr. Calderwood said. “We could rely on gradual and reliable growing seasons. Now it’s all starting to skip around, and these frost events come out of the blue.” Drought isn’t helping. Many smaller growers, some tending fields that are 100 years old, don’t irrigate, but that expensive step may become necessary. And the same fruit fly troubling cherry and raspberry growers in Northern states is also a concern in Maine.
Organic Heirloom Popcorn
Gene Mealhow comes from a family that lost its farmland in the 1980s. Now he grows pearly flint popcorn, whose genetics he can trace back to the 1840s, on about 300 acres in Illinois and Iowa. When he was growing up, predictable spring rains led to even summer heat and a reliable crop of corn. “Now when it rains, it comes down four of five inches at a pop, or we’ve got tornado warnings,” he said. “Believe me, the weather is so extreme.”
This season, some of Iowa’s big corn producers face land so soaked with rain that they have to leave crops in the field; recent floods turned the Missouri River into a monster. But not all of Iowa is in trouble, Mr. Mealhow said. Some parts of the state produced bumper crops last year. His little pocket of land near Shellsburg in eastern Iowa hasn’t been hit as hard, either. Still, he’s doing what many small farmers are: diversifying. He’ll work through his existing inventory of popcorn, which he sells under the Tiny But Mightybrand to stores like Whole Foods Market, and just grow some for seed. The rest of his energy will go into growing onions, sweet corn and tomatoes for restaurants in Iowa City and Cedar Rapids. Next year, perhaps, there will be more popcorn. “Everybody is still optimistic,” he said.
Peaches
The symbol of Georgia and the mainstay of a Southern kitchen, peaches could be devastated by climate change. They need a certain amount of consistent cold weather — what growers call chill hours — followed by dependably warm weather. Without enough chill hours, peach buds are weak, and weak buds make poor fruit. 
In addition, trees are blooming too early and then being hit by unusual frosts, which result in less sellable fruit. In 2017, a warm winter destroyed almost 85 percent of the state’s $30 million peach crop.           It’s part of a patternnoted last year in the federally mandated            National Climate Assessment, which predicted that it would continue. In response, researchers at places like Clemson University are trying to find new peach strains that can handle the shift, but new cultivars are still years away.
Organic Apples
Most organic apples in the American grocery store come from Washington State, which grows about 230,000 tons a year. Apples don’t have the same worries about chill hours that softer fruits like peaches do, but they are being threatened by climate change in their own way. One problem that comes with hotter spring weather is an increase in diseases like fire blight, which can be especially hard to prevent in organic orchards where antibiotics can’t be used, said Kate Prengaman, associate editor of            Good Fruit Grower, a Washington-based magazine for tree fruit and grape farmers.
Hotter temperatures can subject both organic and conventionally grown apples to sunburn, which causes defects on the fruit’s skin. Some growers have taken to installing large nets over orchards to reduce the intensity of the sunlight, but the process is expensive. Unlike many row crops, which can be replanted from year to year, orchards can take a decade or two to regrow, and farmers expect them to produce for at least a generation.
Golden Kiwi Fruit
As warmer weather endangers traditional Texas crops like peaches and pears, some growers have been enticed by exotic fruit like the golden kiwi fruit, a less fuzzy, sweeter and more nutritious cousin of the more common green species. The first golden kiwi crop was harvested in East Texas in 2014 using cultivars from Auburn University in Alabama, and enthusiastic researchers like David Creech have been growing increasingly larger crops every year. The humidity and acidic soil of East Texas seem like a perfect match for this potentially lucrative crop. 
But Tim Hartmann, an extension horticulturalist at Texas A&M University, said kiwi fruit are sensitive to cold weather. Finding the right amount of chill hours — the cold weather that kiwis need to produce — and dodging freezes make the task difficult. “You would think that with temperatures warming up, a subtropical place like Texas would predispose it as a suitable area for subtropical crops,” he said. “But we’ve noticed that as the climate changes and the weather is getting erratic, the freezes we get are more unpredictable.”
Artichokes
When the chef Mary Sue Milliken started noticing artichokes in her favorite Los Angeles farmers’ market in December, all she could think about was climate change. The weather in Castroville, long the epicenter of California artichoke country, has shifted in a state where agriculture is feeling the impact of climate change            more than any other.
The classic California artichoke, with its spring growing season, likes cool, overcast weather that comes when heat from the Central Valley pulls in cool marine air from the Pacific Ocean. But the ocean has been warming, and the marine layer has been less reliable, said Pat Hopper, manager of the California Artichoke Advisory Board. And warmer weather has improved conditions for pests like the artichoke plume moth. As a result, artichoke growers have developed new seed that grows well in the desert heat of Coachella, 450 miles south, which puts California artichokes in the market almost year-round. “We’re in a time of change,” Ms. Hopper said. “The biggest thing consumers are going to see are higher prices. It’s just a result of higher costs all the way around to make things grow.”
Rice
About 1.2 million acres of farmland are planted with rice in Arkansas, which grows about half of the country’s supply. And that rice needs a lot of water. But changing weather patterns produce less rain during the growing season, and the underground aquifers that feed the state’s crop are drying out. “The rice industry as we’ve known it is not sustainable,” said Anna Myers McClung of the Dale Bumpers National Rice Research Center in Stuttgart, Ark. 
Higher temperatures are another culprit. Too much heat alters the starch that the plants produce. Long-grain rice that should look translucent becomes chalky and cooks up stickier. It breaks apart more easily at the mill, causing waste. In response, some farmers are building reservoirs or experimenting with new, less water-intensive growing methods. Researchers like Dr. McClung are working with genetics to find strains of rice that are better adapted to the changing climate and more drought-tolerant. But developing a new variety, she said, could take five to 10 years.

Over the last four years, The New York Times staff photographer Josh Haner has been documenting with stills and video the effects of climate change around the world. A selection of his work about climate migration and Unesco World Heritage Sites affected by climate change is on display at Photo London at the Somerset House from May 16-19. Many of the images were taken by drone, but his most recent work in the Galápagos compelled him to work underwater as well. He spoke with James Estrin about his coverage. The conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.
______ 
  Q: What have been the biggest challenges in doing this work on climate change?
  A: The effects of climate change happen on such a slow time scale that it is often difficult to document visually. As a result, I believe a lot of the climate change imagery we have become accustomed to has focused on polar bears floating on pieces of sea ice, or on calving glaciers. That type of repetitive imagery has made people numb to a lot of the important stories about how our changing climate is affecting people and places around the world.
  There's a lot of research happening around climate change and we tend to do our stories based on the scientific evidence coming out of those reports. But it's difficult to make dynamic imagery of scientists in the wild. So we're looking for projects that are important and have visual appeal.
  I've been documenting climate change with drones around the world for the last four years, and in that time I've seen increased regulations on drone use globally that has made it a lot more complicated to bring dynamic aerial imagery to our viewership.
  Now, the majority of my time is spent filling out permit requests and license applications to get permission to use drones around some of the most fragile places in the world like Easter Island and the Galápagos Islands. First, I have to research each country's unique drone laws. Then I work with lawyers, governments, airspace regulators, customs officials and sometimes the country's air force to be able to use drones to make these photos and footage.
  Q: You were in the Galápagos late last year.
  A: We realized that the Galápagos Islands were important for our series on how climate change is affecting natural and cultural heritage sites around the world. As we started looking into research that's being done there, it became apparent that the majority of the effects were happening underwater. So I realized quite quickly that I would need to take a lot of underwater footage and photography.
  Q: So flying a drone underwater was the solution?
  A: Well we did consider using tethered unmanned submarine type vehicles mounted with cameras, but because of the tether cord, they're not allowed near the animals in the Galápagos. So that meant I needed to learn how to scuba dive. It had always seemed scary to me. I had drawn the line at snorkeling, which I love.
  I spent my weekends over a couple of months learning how to dive off the coast of California in the Monterey Bay. I was lucky to have an instructor who was also an underwater photographer, because there are a whole host of unique issues around maintaining your equipment, preventing water leaks and dealing with sun flare and exposure.
  Additionally, after months of discussions we were also granted the permission to fly drones in the Galápagos. One of the stipulations was that I had to be accompanied by a national park ranger the whole time while we were above land and in the water -- just to make sure that none of our recording negatively impacted the animals in their natural habitat. The rangers were looking at any effect on animal behavior and also were making sure we limited our impact on these very fragile lands.
  All of our equipment and clothing had to be quarantined before we went onto these islands, many of which are off limits to visitors. We had to bring different clothes, including new shoes and hats for each island. The reporter, Nicholas Casey, and I had to strip down and put all of our belongings into plastic bags so that they could then be taken directly to quarantine when we were taken back to the main island.
  Q: What did it feel like to be on these historic islands, some of which almost no one goes on?
  A: Being on these islands was an unbelievable experience.
  We had to commit to our itinerary in advance and just hoped that the weather would cooperate. Because there were so many restrictions on visiting these sites, we had to stick to our itinerary, which is difficult when you've never been to the places before.
  Very few people have visited these locations and many of the bays don't have real names on maps, so it's very hard to Google. Trying to do preliminary research was almost impossible and we just had to trust our contacts there.
  What's really unique about the Galápagos is that there are very few apex predators there. So the animals are usually not surprised by your presence. As long as you maintain a very calm demeanor they don't change their behavior.
  That's also why they limit access to these places -- they don't want animals to become too accustomed to human visitors.
  Q: What's the effect of climate change on the Galápagos?
  A: There is so much going on. It is in the cross hairs of three different currents. El Niño and La Niña swings really affect it the hardest. We were looking at the ripple effect from warming temperatures affecting coral, which affects the smaller fish like sardines, which then affects the sea lions and birds that depend on them.
  Q: How is photographing underwater different, and what are the challenges?
  A: Dexterity becomes a problem underwater because you're wearing gloves and you're trying to manipulate small buttons on a giant plastic housing that holds your precious camera. And when you go to the Galápagos you're not taking a ton of backup gear with you because you have to be nimble as you move between land and sea and change islands.
  You have to plan how deep underwater you're going to go, and choose your housing accordingly. Some only work a few feet deep and others can go much farther than that.
  So you have to really commit to your focal length before you dive because there's no easy way to change lenses underwater. This is always a challenge especially when you're not quite sure what you're going to see in each location.
  If you planned wrongly, you would have to surface, then flush out your equipment with fresh water, wait for it to dry, change your lenses, re-lubricate the rubber seals that go between the different pieces of your housing and then put it all back together and clean off any sand residue as well. That's just to change lenses, batteries or memory cards.
  It takes a lot of planning and practice to decide how you're going to approach different situations. I was really learning as I went.
  Q: So, is it quiet when you're diving? It would seem to me that while you have to be aware of everything, there's also, in some ways, fewer distractions.
  A: I'm not sure that there are fewer distractions. The main challenge when I'm scuba diving is that my visual field is limited, because you're wearing a mask where you can't see far to the left or right.
  Nick and I were always together -- along with the ranger -- so that when somebody saw something outside of the peripheral vision of another person we would tap each other's leg. We also had slates that we could write on underwater so that we didn't have to surface to talk and then spend time re-acclimating as we dove down.
  A lot of the places we were diving were close to shore, so you would have some waves crashing against the coastline. But there were very few motorized vehicles around, and so it was very silent underwater. The loudest noise was that of the air bubbles from our regulator as you exhaled.
  Q: How is it different than other environments you've photographed in?
  A: There is limited visibility underwater, and animals are often camouflaged so you're doing a lot of searching for the animals and the plant life you're looking to document. It's a bit like a scavenger hunt but with a time pressure because you have limited amounts of air when you're underwater.
  Q: How long does your air supply last underwater?
  A: We had somewhere between 30 and 40 minutes of air and on one of the dives, a lot of our time was spent just trying to find a marine iguana underwater during the short amount of time they spend feeding on algae. They're camouflaged and difficult to see!
  Q: Did you use a strobe?
  A: I was not strobing because I was shooting video, but I did have some underwater LED lights. And that's just one more thing to manipulate when you're underwater. So besides focus, exposure, switching between stills and video, you then have to adjust the intensity and directionality of your lights that are on these articulating arms above the camera, and do all this when there are currents.
  Q: What is the next challenge?
  A: Some combination of drone imagery with maybe 3D modeling and interactive graphics so that you can use the movement of the drone to create narrative in the piece. That's what I'd like to experiment with more in the future.
  I also tried time-lapse work in Yellowstone because drones were off limits in United States national parks. I became really enthralled by time-lapse imagery and I hope to use that a lot more in the coming years.
  Q: You have always been a lover of the outdoors?
  A: My dad was a lover of the outdoors and my parents each worked part time when I was growing up. When my dad was taking care of me we would often head into nature for hikes, and it became imprinted in me at an early age -- the importance of being in the outdoors. And I've continued doing that. I made some of my first photographs in forests around San Francisco and in the mountains of Yosemite.
  Every summer I take long backpacking trips. I really feel the most at home when I'm away from all technology and sitting by a lake in the Sierra.
  One of the major reasons that my wife and I recently chose to move to Northern California was to be closer to nature and closer to the places that I've backpacked and camped in as a child. We really want to share that with our daughter as she grows up.

The presidential election is just weeks away, and climate change has broken through as a defining issue for Americans this year, even amid a historic pandemic and deep economic uncertainty weighing upon the nation.
Two-thirds of Americans say the government isn't doing enough to reduce the effects of global warming, according to a June survey from the Pew Research Center, and the two presidential candidates' approaches couldn't be further apart. President Trump has often dismissed global warming as a hoax; his rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr., calls climate change an ''emergency'' that requires rapidly overhauling the nation's energy system. 
  Their differences raise profound questions about the government's role in shaping the United States economy and America's place on the world stage. Here's a guide to major climate questions in the election.
  WHAT PRICE IS AMERICA READY TO PAY?
  This is the most common question asked of any politician who proposes to fight climate change: How much will it cost?
  But there is another equally important question: How much will it cost to not fight climate change? It makes no sense to look only at the cost of action and ignore the cost of inaction, climate experts point out.
  Rising temperatures, after all, carry their own price, including deadlier heat waves, crop failures, more destructive wildfires and higher sea levels. The federal government's National Climate Assessment warns that even moderate warming could cost the American economy hundreds of billions of dollars each year by century's end.
  Many economists argue that imposing a price on carbon-dioxide emissions, either directly (by taxing fossil fuels) or indirectly (by promoting cleaner energy), can be worth the cost. Others warn that it's difficult to put a dollar figure on all the risks involved, but that climate action should be thought of as insurance against future catastrophe.
  Mr. Trump has consistently downplayed the dangers of global warming and has focused instead on the immediate costs of climate policies. His administration has rolled back emissions rules on cars and power plants to ease burdens on industry, while developing calculations that suggest climate change won't harm the economy much (a view the government's own scientists have rejected).
  Mr. Biden, for his part, says the United States needs to zero out greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050 to help avoid the worst consequences of warming and has proposed spending $2 trillion over four years as a starting point. He has focused on the health and economic benefits -- cleaner air, the creation of new industries -- but has faced pressure to ease the blow for industries reliant on fossil fuels.
  ARE FOSSIL FUELS PART OF THE FUTURE?
  There is broad scientific consensus on what the world must do to halt global warming: Stop burning fossil fuels like coal, natural gas and oil.
  Emissions in the United States have been declining in recent years, largely because utilities have been retiring old coal plants in favor of cleaner and cheaper natural gas, wind and solar. Still, last year the country derived 80 percent of its total energy from fossil fuels, an unsustainable level if the worst consequences of warming are to be avoided.
  Mr. Trump has long vowed to protect the fossil fuel industry in the name of preserving jobs and enhancing America's ''energy dominance.'' His administration tried hard to rescue the coal industry (though that effort has largely failed) and has opened new public lands in places like Alaska for oil and gas development.
  In a Trump second term, some clean technologies like renewable energy and electric cars would most likely still expand, though mainly because they keep getting cheaper and states like California are promoting them. Mr. Trump's Environmental Protection Agency is, however, expected to challenge efforts like California's proposal to phase out sales of gasoline cars by 2035.
  Mr. Biden envisions a much faster shift away from fossil fuels, saying that new cars should eventually be required to run on electricity instead of gasoline and that emissions from power plants should be zeroed out by 2035. Mr. Trump has sought to turn this into a campaign issue by claiming Mr. Biden would ban fracking, a technique for extracting oil and natural gas, even though Mr. Biden has said he would not. Mr. Biden has vowed to end new drilling permits on federal lands and waters.
  HOW QUICKLY MUST THINGS CHANGE?
  As countries have awakened to the hazards of climate change, they have slowly started curbing their greenhouse gas emissions in recent years. Some energy giants, like BP, now expect global demand for oil to plateau in the decades ahead.
  But scientists warn that governments aren't acting nearly fast enough to avoid severe global warming. And every year of delay makes the problem harder to solve.
  The clock is ticking. Global temperatures have already risen 1 degree Celsius from preindustrial times. For that increase to stay well below 2 degrees Celsius, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that global carbon dioxide emissions need to get down to zero by around midcentury. Blowing past that limit, the panel warned, could bring about a world of worsening food and water shortages, collapsing polar ice sheets, and a mass die-off of coral reefs.
  Getting emissions all the way down to zero would entail a staggeringly rapid transformation of the world economy.
  In the United States, climate activists have rallied around the Green New Deal, which envisions getting the United States to net zero emissions as quickly as possible in order to give less-wealthy nations more time to make their own transitions. Mr. Biden has called the Green New Deal a ''crucial framework'' but has distanced himself from its particulars, instead aiming to zero out America's emissions by 2050.
  Doing so would require doubling or tripling the pace at which clean electricity sources like wind or solar get installed, one recent study found, all while slashing pollution from cars, trucks, buildings, industry and agriculture.
  Mr. Trump hasn't committed to any climate targets. One analysis by Wood Mackenzie, an energy research firm, suggested that another four years of delay would ''dramatically reduce the possibility'' of the nation meeting the 2050 goal for eliminating carbon emissions.
  SHOULD GOVERNMENTS PUT A THUMB ON THE SCALE?
  Governments routinely steer industries, the economy and society toward various goals. Cigarettes are taxed to deter smoking. Roads are built with public money, which encourages driving.
  When it comes to climate change, some economists advocate simply taxing fossil fuels in proportion to the damage they cause to health and to the climate. The idea is that these carbon taxes would be a relatively light-handed government intervention that gives private companies incentive to reduce their emissions.
  Mr. Biden has mostly steered away from carbon taxes, reflecting a widening view on the left that they are politically treacherous and work too slowly.
  Instead, his campaign has called for new regulations and spending that would accelerate wind, solar, and electric vehicle deployment while investing in nascent technologies like hydrogen (a clean-burning fuel that can be produced from gas or renewables), carbon capture (trapping carbon dioxide from industrial polluters before it escapes into the atmosphere and warms the planet) or advanced nuclear power.
  These proposals are far more aggressive and ambitious than anything pursued by the Obama administration -- which, at the time, was criticized by Republicans for picking winners and losers.
  None of this means that Mr. Trump shies away from picking favorite industries, of course.
  His administration has pursued policies to encourage oil, gas and coal production while reducing pollution regulations, helping to give those industries a leg up over cleaner rivals. The administration has also overseen new tax credits and regulatory changes to promote low-emissions technologies like carbon capture or advanced nuclear, though that hasn't been a central focus.
  HOW CAN THE U.S. ADAPT TO WORSENING DISASTERS?
  For the most part, the United States reacts to disasters after they strike, rather than spending money ahead of time to reduce risks or even move people out of harm's way. When floods or hurricanes destroy homes, governments spend billions to rebuild in place.
  But that's an untenable long-term strategy. Climate change threatens to make wildfires, hurricanes, floods and other disasters more destructive, putting ever more people at risk.
  During the Trump administration, the government has taken several steps to try to prepare for disasters ahead. The Department of Housing and Urban Development is handing out $16 billion to help states defend against future floods and storms. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has sought and received funding to pay for large-scale relocation away from risky areas. More contentiously, the Army Corps of Engineers has pressed cities to evict homeowners from flood zones in exchange for aid.
  But experts say the administration is hobbled by its unwillingness to explicitly recognize the climate threat. In 2017, Mr. Trump rescinded a policy that required agencies to consider sea-level rise when building infrastructure. In 2018, FEMA stripped the words ''climate change'' from its strategic plan.
  Mr. Biden has called for more sweeping adaptation measures, proposing, for instance, that all new federal funding to rebuild roads, bridges or water infrastructure must consider climate change.
  But there are huge challenges. Past efforts to limit coastal development or set stricter building codes have often faced serious blowback. And the idea of retreating from areas that can't be defended, which experts warn will become more important as disasters worsen, is a political minefield.
  WHO IS HURT THE MOST BY WARMING?
  This has been a year -- and an election -- where racial and economic inequality has leapt to the forefront of the national conversation.
  Climate change is an essential part of that dialogue, because its effects are profoundly unequal. Recently, researchers have shown how Black and Hispanic neighborhoods suffer worse heat today than other parts of town, a legacy of racist housing policies. Hotter days threaten to widen the racial achievement gap in schools. Fossil fuel pollution often poses the greatest health hazard to low-income communities.
  Solutions can be unequal, too. Subsidies for rooftop solar panels or electric cars often flow to wealthier households. Programs to help people move from flood-prone areas have historically focused on richer neighborhoods.
  Mr. Biden says he would make inequality a core part of his climate plan by, for instance, prioritizing low-income communities for clean energy funding. Mr. Trump has said very little on the subject, although his E.P.A. has highlighted its cleanups of Superfund sites as a form of environmental justice.
  WHAT ABOUT BIRDS, BEARS AND OTHER ANIMALS?
  Alongside climate change, the world faces a biodiversity crisis.
  Last year, a United Nations report warned that as many as one million species could face the risk of extinction in the decades ahead as a result of farming, logging, poaching and overfishing as well as rising temperatures. The report called on countries to dramatically scale up their conservation efforts.
  Debates over the purpose of America's public lands stretch back more than a century. How much should be used for mining, logging, recreation? How much kept wild? The candidates have markedly different visions of how far to tip the scales in either direction.
  The Trump administration has relaxed protections for wildlife and endangered species, often arguing that they impede industrial activities or job creation in drilling or logging. And he has opened formerly protected lands in places like Utah to energy and mining exploration. This year, however, President Trump also signed the Great Outdoors Act, a bipartisan bill to put hundreds of millions of dollars into conservation and national park programs, a policy sought by environmentalists.
  Mr. Biden would go further: He has endorsed a call by conservationists to protect 30 percent of America's lands and waters by 2030 as a way of aiding biodiversity and slowing extinction rates. (Today, about 12 percent of land and 26 percent of waters are protected.) Achieving that goal may prove complicated in practice, as it could entail restricting industry and other activities in large parts of the country.
  WHERE SHOULD AMERICA STAND ON THE WORLD STAGE?
  The United States can't solve climate change alone. After all, the country is responsible only for about 14 percent of global emissions.
  So one of the big questions in the election is how the United States should use its influence to shape policies abroad.
  In 2017, President Trump said he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate deal, an international agreement based on peer pressure: Countries set voluntary targets to reduce their emissions, then urge each other to do more. Mr. Trump argued that the deal would shackle the United States and that other countries were unlikely to do their part.
  The United States is set to formally leave the Paris agreement on Nov. 4, one day after the presidential election.
  Since Mr. Trump announced America's withdrawal, some governments have continued taking action. Europe has scaled up its climate policies, and China recently pledged to become carbon-neutral by 2060, though it remains unclear how the country might do so.
  The question is whether the world could make even faster progress with the United States engaged.
  Mr. Biden argues the answer is yes. He has pledged to rejoin the Paris agreement and ''use every tool of American foreign policy to push the rest of the world to raise their ambitions.''
  There is plenty of debate over how much leverage the United States actually has to persuade other countries to act more forcefully on climate change. But at the core is a fundamental split in how each candidate views the role of the United States on the global stage.

Staggering rain totals, fueled by a warming atmosphere that can hold more moisture, are being recorded from the storm.
As hurricanes go, Sally was not especially powerful. Rated a Category 2 storm when it struck the Gulf Coast on Wednesday, it was soon downgraded. But climate change likely made it more dangerous by slowing it down and feeding it more moisture, setting it up to pummel the region with wind and catastrophic rainfall.
Sally was crawling at about 3 miles per hour when its eye made landfall early Wednesday near Gulf Shores, Ala., and was “inching its way inland” later in the day, the National Hurricane Center said. The slow movement, or stalling, of the storm led to staggering rain totals, with more than two feet in some areas by midmorning Wednesday and widespread flooding.
“When a storm moves slower, it lingers longer over the same location,” said Kimberly Wood, a geoscientist at Mississippi State University. “A rain rate of, say, an inch an hour — that’s not so bad if the rain only lasts 30 minutes. But if it lasts for half a day, that adds up quickly.”
Sally was not an isolated example of a stalling hurricane. “There is increasing evidence that storms are slowing down,” Dr. Wood said.
That evidence comes in part from a 2018 study that showed that hurricanes near the Gulf and Atlantic coasts were increasingly likely to stall. The study also found a clear signal of more local rainfall, said one of the authors, James P. Kossin, a researcher with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “And it was associated with increasing frequency of stalled systems,” he said.
Climate change has also led to wetter storms, Dr. Wood said, because warmer air holds more moisture. Between the slowing speeds and increasing moisture, with storms like Sally “there’s a combination effect,” she said.
Researchers increasingly see a link between stalling of hurricanes and climate change. Rapid warming in the Arctic has reduced the difference in temperature between that region and the tropics, leading to a weakening and slowing of the jet stream and related  winds that drive hurricanes’ forward movement.
Hurricanes also sometimes meander, Dr. Kossin said. Hurricane Harvey, which inundated Houston in 2017, moved back and forth over the area, increasing the deluge. Sally was heading due west, parallel to the coast, on Monday when it made a sudden right-angle turn to the north early Tuesday.
Such movements may also be linked to slowing atmospheric circulation, Dr. Kossin said. “You won’t really get meandering until you get a slow storm,” he said. “They don’t go zipping around like go-karts.”
While Sally’s winds were not as intense as the strongest hurricanes — maximum sustained speeds early Wednesday were about 105 miles an hour, about 50 percent slower than a Category 5 storm — by lingering for longer, the storm may also have boosted storm surge, the wind-driven buildup of water that can quickly flood coastal areas, often with devastating results.
But storm surge can be influenced by many other factors, including the timing of tides and the shallowness of a bay or another body of water. In this case, Sally’s slow speed “contributed more to the extreme rainfall flooding than to the surge flooding,” said Rick Luettich, a professor at the University of North Carolina and a principal developer of the leading surge model used by forecasters.
Dr. Luettich said the storm’s surge was close to projections of about five feet. But another characteristic of some hurricanes that is linked to warmer oceans, the rapid strengthening of a storm before landfall, “gave the water a bigger push” than earlier forecasts called for, he said.
Hurricanes are not the only kind of storms affected by climate change, and not the only kind that can bring catastrophic flooding to the Gulf Coast or other regions. Record rain from a low-pressure system in August 2016, a large storm but one that did not rotate like a hurricane, led to floods in Baton Rouge. A gauge east of the city received 26.5 inches of rain in three days.
That storm prompted an attribution study, research that tries to determine the extent, if any, of climate change’s influence on an extreme weather event. It found that climate change had increased the likelihood of such a storm along the Gulf Coast in any given year by 40 percent since 1900. In the current climate, there is a 3 percent chance in any given year of a similar storm.
“The risk of extreme precipitation events in this region has gone up,” said Sarah Kapnick, a researcher at NOAA’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, N.J., who worked on the study.
“There’s a basic theoretical understanding underlying all of this,” Dr. Kapnick said. With warming “you get more water vapor in the sky.”
“So when you get these storms, be they hurricanes or summer storms, they have the potential to hold more water in them,” she added. “And that water has to go somewhere.”

Many discussions of climate change begin at the water's edge, in cities and towns where the rising ocean is an existential threat, or will be soon. But when he chose to embark on a series on the topic, Michael Kimmelman, The New York Times's architecture critic, started instead with a long look at landlocked Mexico City.
The city has historically struggled to provide adequate drinking water, saddled as it is with inadequate infrastructure, a shortsighted administration and urban sprawl. The danger, then, isn't water, but drought -- which the city is at increased risk for because of climate change. ''So climate change is not going to drown Mexico City. But what it does is act like a spark in the tinder.'' 
  For Mr. Kimmelman, who has been at The Times in various roles since 1990, the title of architecture critic, which he assumed in 2011, encompasses far more than giving new skyscrapers or museums the thumbs-up or -down.
  Instead, he said, he seeks to examine not only the aesthetics of what we build, but how it functions in a community, how it shapes and defines where we live and work and play, and how it brings us together or pushes us apart. ''To write about architecture is really to write about how we live, and the places we make. And that is inextricable from the economic and social circumstances of places we make, and also the environmental ones,'' he said.
  For the first time in human history, more people now live in cities than don't, Mr. Kimmelman said, ''so the way we build our cities and prepare for the future is the question of our human survival.'' That is the question he has set out to explore in a new series entitled ''Changing Climate, Changing Cities,'' in collaboration with the Times multimedia journalist Josh Haner: How these most complex and dynamic of human creations can meet the challenges of rising seas, longer droughts, stronger storms and scorching heat, and how efforts to do so will change our cities in turn. (The third installment, on the Dutch city of Rotterdam's long history beating back the North Sea, begins on the front page.)
  Hence the focus on climate. Mr. Kimmelman first conceived of the series over lunch with Joseph Kahn, now The Times's managing editor, while discussing the variegated initiatives at the paper to cover climate change, including the creation of a dedicated climate desk this spring.
  That climate change is occurring is the overwhelming scientific consensus -- the questions now are how to stem emissions, what exactly the effects of climate change will be and how best we can mitigate them. Mr. Kimmelman decided to explore those topics through the design and architecture of our cities, attempting, along the way, to capture a bit of the cultures behind them as well. ''I want the series to deal not just with the climate question, but to talk about the nature of these cities,'' he said. It's no mean feat. ''Writing about cities as if they were characters is very complicated.''
  That is especially the case in places like the Pearl River Delta in China (the focus of the second installment in the series) and Rotterdam, for which Mr. Kimmelman took a very different tack -- not freshly built urban sprawl endangered by the rising sea, but a centuries-old city already famous for water management. ''To people who deal with resilience and climate adaptation, the Netherlands are the annoyingly perfect custodians of good strategies,'' Mr. Kimmelman said.
  It's a practice perfected over a thousand years of necessity. Rotterdam is not particularly wealthy and houses a large migrant population by virtue of being a port. As such, its success comes less from any material advantage than a philosophy of adapting to the climate not only physically, but socially.
  Despite the myriad challenges that climate change presents, Mr. Kimmelman views the story he's crafting as ultimately an optimistic one. Mitigating the damage of climate change's effects, and preparing for more, is usually just viewed as a cost. ''But the changes that can be made throw off all sorts of other benefits for cities,'' he said. ''And the long-term economic as well as social benefits can be huge.''

  Last month, young people around the world skipped school to join global climate strikes. Children of all ages marched, chanted and carried signs with slogans like, ''You'll die of old age, I'll die of climate change.''
  Dark messages like that highlighted the worry many young people feel about climate change.
  Climate change and related natural disasters can take a toll on mental health, according to a 2017 report by the American Psychological Association. That can include depression and anxiety.
  Children may be one of the hardest-hit groups. According to a poll by the Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation, more than seven in 10 teenagers and young adults in the United States say climate change will cause harm to their generation. That includes young people who identify as Democratics and Republicans.
  In order to lighten that anxiety, experts say, parents should talk to their children.
  To address these fears, find a calm moment to ask your child what they've seen or heard about climate change and how that makes them feel, said Dr. Lise Van Susteren, a psychiatrist in Washington and a founder of the Climate Psychiatry Alliance. She said parents should gently correct irrational fears but not downplay anxieties just to make children feel better. That could just make the child feel she can't trust adults to be honest with them on this topic.
  ''Talk about the problem, then pivot to the solution,'' Dr. Van Susteren said.
  Once you've discussed your child's climate fears, talk about people and organizations that are already working on large-scale climate solutions, said Maria Ojala, a psychologist at Orebro University in Sweden who studies young people and climate change.
  If possible, talk about solutions in a personal context. Highlight steps you've already taken as a family or as individuals to reduce your carbon footprints and brainstorm new ideas together. Taking action can be an empowering antidote to fear, Dr. Van Susteren said. Encourage your child to take action with her peers as well, like joining a group at school or volunteering with a local organization. Collective action has mental health benefits, according to Dr. Ojala. ''We are social beings and it's very good for our well-being to work together with others and be part of a group,'' she said.
  You probably won't get rid of your child's fears altogether, and that's O.K., Dr. Ojala said. The goal is to help your child cope with her fears in a constructive way to avoid hopelessness.
  Finally, think about your own personal choices and lead by example, Dr. Van Susteren said. Your children are probably watching.

  The story behind the salt prints in our ghost forests story
  By Claire O'Neill
  Hello! I'm the art director for the NYT climate team, so you probably won't have seen my name here before. It's mostly a behind-the-scenes job. But, we thought you'd be interested in the back story on the piece about ghost forests we published this week -- not only because the topic is important, but also because the presentation was unusual.
  The gist of the story, reported by Moises Velasquez-Manoff and photographed by Gabriella Demczuk, is that rising seas are creating huge stands of dead trees, sometimes surprisingly far from the sea. It's happening in lots of places, but we focused on the Eastern Seaboard.
  We've used drones, wide lenses and other digital flourishes to cover forests in the past -- like in our story last year on cedar trees dying in Lebanon. This time we thought we'd do something different and get close to the roots of these things dying en masse.
  Gabriella and Moises trekked out to the sites in the thick of a July heat wave, trudging through thick mud and marsh to find these ghost forests. ''Sweating under a black sheet,'' she said, ''I photographed the trees using a 4x5 large format camera to capture the subtle hues and exquisite details that only film can produce.''
  And, because she was photographing with film, we brainstormed ways to experiment with printmaking. She had the idea to collect salt water from each location and use it as a wash to sensitize photo paper to make salt prints. It's a very early photo technique from the 19th-century that gives a sort of sepia tone to the final product.
  In Gabriella's words: ''I welcomed discoloration, fog and irregularities that came with using different concentrations of salt levels in the water to create a visual metaphor for how salt is slowly killing these coastal forests, stripping the bark and bleaching its colors.''
  Maybe you loved it, maybe you hated it. But we hope that it's something you haven't seen before, and something that sticks with you. As always, let us know what you think of the story.

One reader cites an ad that the president signed in 2009 warning about the perils of climate change. Others criticize him for holding large indoor rallies.
To the Editor:
Re “Spurred by Fires, Trump and Biden Clash on Climate” (front page, Sept. 15):
You refer to President Trump as a president “who has long scorned climate change as a hoax.” But the reality is more sinister: Much as we’ve recently learned about Mr. Trump’s views on the coronavirus, he has been well aware of the reality of climate change.
How do we know? Because in your own newspaper, on Dec. 6, 2009, Mr. Trump was part of a group that purchased a full-page ad urging action on climate change, in which he (and the group) stated, “If we fail to act now, it is scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet.”
So Mr. Trump knows the scientific truth, but for political purposes he chooses to lie about it to the American public. Apparently, he has so little respect for his own supporters that he just assumes they are too unintelligent to recognize what he himself knows to be “scientifically irrefutable.”

To the Editor:
Re “Trump, a Bold Climate Denier, Confronts a Charred California” (front page, Sept. 14):
President Trump blames California and other Western states for the fires because “they don’t listen to us” regarding forest management. A glance at the map shows that most of the acreage burned involves federal property managed by the Agriculture Department.
Yes, there are management problems, but the responsibility for most forests in the Western United States belongs to the federal government, and these lands have been overseen by Trump appointees for the last three years.

To the Editor:
Re “Trump Defends Holding Indoor Rallies Amid Pandemic” (news article, Sept. 15):
President Trump’s response to a Las Vegas newspaper tells us all we need to know about him. He told The Las Vegas Review-Journal that he was “not at all concerned” about catching the coronavirus at his large indoor rally, because he was “on a stage and it’s very far away.” Not one bit of concern for his supporters who were maskless and shoulder to shoulder in a large manufacturing plant.
Mr. Trump, once again, showed he cares only about three things — himself, his bankbook and his re-election. Where is any sign he cares about his constitutional responsibility to protect the American people? His lack of empathy and concern for our health is shameful.
Marla Allard
Washington
To the Editor:
I have to hand it to President Trump. When he said that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it, he was not kidding. Mr. Trump is now holding large indoor rallies with people encouraged to be physically close, to yell and scream, and to be unmasked.
Since science tells us that many of these people will contract Covid-19, with some percentage of them becoming ill and dying, he quite openly is doing the equivalent of killing (his followers no less), and getting away with it.

Marine Labs on the Water’s Edge Are Threatened by Climate Change

Highlight: A marine lab built to withstand hurricanes faces a slower menace: climate change. Problems arising wherever science operates at the shifting border of soil and sea.


Body


COCODRIE, La. — A marine laboratory 85 miles southwest of New Orleans was designed to be a fortress against extreme weather. But it might be defeated by climate change.
Sitting at the end of Louisiana State Highway 56, where dirt dissolves into wetlands and then the Gulf of Mexico, the laboratory, the W.J. DeFelice Marine Center, has successfully weathered many hurricanes since it opened its doors in 1986. It stands 18 feet above the ground on pillars with pilings that extend more than 100 feet underground. Its walls can withstand winds of up to 250 miles per hour.
But the water is coming. Around the country, from New Jersey to Massachusetts, Virginia to Oregon, education centers and marine laboratories like this one are bracing against rising seas and a changing climate. The assault from climate change is slower but more relentless than any storm, and will ultimately do more damage. It threatens researchers’ ability to study marine environments up close at a time when it’s more vital than ever to understand them. 
Bob Cowen, head of the National Association of Marine Laboratories, sees climate change as a challenge, but also a scientific opportunity. “We’re feeling it, and we’re also studying it at the same time as best we can,” he said. If labs like this one have to shut down, decades of on-site measurements could be disrupted — and, researchers say, academic budgets might not allow replacements to be built, or built on a comparable scale.
The parking lot at the DeFelice Marine Center, the heart of the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium of some two dozen institutions, was once high and dry. It now floods several dozen times a year, occasionally causing the facility to close because of the difficulty of getting across the lot and into the building. Officials predict that, without action, the lab might need to shut down several dozen days each year within the next 10 to 15 years. The corrosive saltwater attacks the structure and has risen up through the soil into buried electrical cables, at one point causing a blackout. Some floods are accompanied by droves of fiddler crabs that sometimes find their way into the elevators.
“They smell,” said Murt Conover, the associate director of education and outreach. “I’ve heard it described as carnage. Rotting carnage.”
“It was built to be on the edge of the world,” said Ursula Emery McClure, senior project designer with the architecture firm Perkins &amp; Will and a longtime architectural researcher at the marine center, but “it wasn’t meant to be in open water.”
Alex Kolker, an associate professor at the marine consortium who is currently studying sea level rise in Morocco, said in a telephone interview that because south Louisiana’s land is subsiding while the oceans are rising, the region has what may be the highest relative sea level rise in the country. “We’re just 10 to 30 years in front of the curve of everybody else,” he said. 
Fox Island Environmental Education Center, a Virginia institution that has opened up the wonders of the natural world to young people for more than 40 years, shut down in November. Between erosion and sea level rise, so much of the island’s salt marsh had disappeared that “it made it unsafe to run the program,” said Tom Ackerman, vice president for education at the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, which owns the island center. 
And what is lost is not just a building and its bunks, but inspiration: a number of the young people who stayed on Fox Island and gained a love of nature and the environment have gone on to be scientists. One, Kenneth M. Halanych, a professor of biological sciences at Auburn University, now researches topics including climate change and shifts in the ranges of marine organisms. “If I hadn’t had those formative experiences in the Bay, I might have ended up doing something totally different,” he said.
Many marine labs are preparing to meet similar challenges, though they are in locations that are not yet facing the level of threat that Louisiana is. 
At the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, Robert S.C. Munier, the vice president for marine facilities and operations, said that the facility was feeling the effects of climate change already in a battering of the existing dock. The institution is planning an $80 million renovation of its waterfront with higher docks and an adjacent buildings complex. “It’s part of our DNA, getting access to the sea,” he said. But the planning is tricky, he said: projections of sea level rise suggest that it could be 2.5 feet in the next 50 years, or as much as four feet. “Which one do you pick? Those are pretty fundamental questions.”
In New Jersey, the Rutgers University Marine Field Station has put climate change into its 30-year plan as “a long-term experiment to learn how infrastructure and people will react to the rising sea, and how the rising sea will interact with human development,” said Oscar Schofield, acting director of the field station and chairman of the Rutgers Department of Marine and Coastal Sciences. Already, he said, sea level rise and subsidence leave the road to the station frequently flooded at high tides.
At the Louisiana center, Ms. Conover sees educational value in their problems. Along with its mission as a scientific research facility, it is also a center for environmental education with visits from some 5,000 students each year. “If our parking lot is flooding when a group is here, we definitely talk about why we’re flooding on that given day, when five years ago we wouldn’t, given the same conditions.” That example, she said, “gives the perspective of what our coastal communities are dealing with.” 
In an office packed with toys and a sign reading “Mischief Managed” — a reference to the Marauder’s Map in Harry Potter — she said “nature gives us the content we need to teach.” Yes, the fiddler crabs are gross, she acknowledged, “but awesome in their grossness.”
Officials at the Louisiana facility are making plans to stick around, despite some perceptibly sloping floors and a parking lot so often flooded that managers have discussed the purchase of a swamp buggy that could transport people to the site from lots on the dry side of a levee a few miles inland. Other ideas include extending a boardwalk from the center to high-ground parking lots closer to the slightly higher road.
“We very much feel like we have to be in Cocodrie,” Dr. Kolker said. “We’re marine scientists. We study the ocean.”
Brian Roberts, associate director of science at the consortium, said, “there are so many opportunities you lose if you just pack up and leave.” Longtime measurements from the site would be disrupted by a move, he noted. 
The facility has already raised the height of docks for its two research ships and renovated the facility to move equipment to higher floors. In a recent article about the challenges to conducting marine research in an age of coastal inundation for theirs and similar facilities, Dr. Roberts and colleagues concluded: “Global sea-level rise is one of the greatest challenges facing society in the 21st century, and understanding how this phenomenon impacts coastal systems, infrastructure and the people who use them requires a regular coastal presence.”
Dr. Kolker, who is also an author of the report, said that future improvements for the facility included incorporating some of the infrastructure used on offshore oil terminals, like saltwater-resistant electrical cables, but noted that adaptation is expensive. The consortium is also building an additional facility on higher ground, about 30 miles to the north in the city of Houma, La., which could handle operations on days when the DeFelice center can’t be used.
Ms. McClure, the architect, said that the encroaching seas had helped set her on her current area of study: “how buildings get decommissioned as the oceans begin to take them.” For a field that could be called unbuilding, she noted, “If you decide you’re going to let the ocean take it, taking it down will cost a lot of money.”
Worse, she said, looking even farther ahead, “What happens when it’s entire communities?”

At a meeting last year, industry leaders contradicted public claims that emissions of climate-warming methane are under control
Last summer, oil and gas-industry groups were lobbying to overturn federal rules on leaks of natural gas, a major contributor to climate change. Their message: The companies had emissions under control.
In private, the lobbyists were saying something very different.
At a discussion convened last year by the Independent Petroleum Association of America, a group that represents energy companies, participants worried that producers were intentionally flaring, or burning off, far too much natural gas, threatening the industry’s image, according to a recording of the meeting reviewed by The New York Times.
“We’re just flaring a tremendous amount of gas,” said Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, at the June 2019 gathering, held in Colorado Springs. “This pesky natural gas,” he said. “The value of it is very minimal,” particularly to companies drilling mainly for oil. 
A well can produce both oil and natural gas, but oil commands far higher prices. Flaring it is an inexpensive way of getting rid of the gas. 
Yet the practice of burning it off, producing dramatic flares and attracting criticism, represented a “huge, huge threat” to the industry’s efforts to portray natural gas as a cleaner and more climate-friendly energy source, he said, and that was damaging the industry’s image, particularly among younger generations.
“What’s our message going forward?” Mr. Ness said. “What’s going to stick with those young people and make them support oil and gas?” 
The recording runs 1 hour 22 minutes, opening with a moderator’s remarks and concluding with a panel discussion that covered a wide range of issues including job creation, the threats posed by solar and wind energy, and the federal leasing of oil and gas rights. The audio was provided by an organization dedicated to tracking climate policy that said the recording had been made by an industry official who attended the meeting.
Neither the organization nor the official was willing to be identified, out of concerns for industry retaliation, but three people heard in the recording, including the event’s moderator, Ryan Ullman of the Independent Petroleum Association, said that it reflected their comments. Jennifer Pett Marsteller, an association spokeswoman, confirmed the meeting’s date, location and speakers’ list, which matched the recording. She declined to comment on the speakers’ remarks, saying there was no official recording.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Ness, Kristen Hamman, declined to confirm his remarks, saying that the Independent Petroleum Association had not produced an official transcript of the meeting that would allow her to do a comparison. Mr. Ness has publicly spoken against the need to strengthen regulation of methane, a major component in natural gas, calling stronger rules “an unnecessary burden” and saying the industry already produced “valuable energy resources in a responsible manner.”
The remarks reflect the concerns of an industry that has presented itself as part of the solution to climate change, and natural gas as an important “bridge fuel” that can help the world shift away from coal, the dirtiest-burning energy source, toward renewable energy.
Natural gas, when burned (whether in a flare, or to fuel a household oven), typically emits just half the planet-warming greenhouse gases that coal does. But by flaring off natural gas, rather than capturing it for use, companies are creating pollution without creating usable energy.
Many companies do directly drill for and capture natural gas for use. But researchers have warned that drilling for the gas also causes sizable leaks of methane directly into the atmosphere, which is even more damaging for the climate than flaring the gas. Methane can also escape faulty flares, and companies sometimes also deliberately release the gas from wells and pipelines in a practice known as venting.
Methane can trap more than 80 times more heat in the earth’s atmosphere than carbon dioxide, over the shorter term. Research has shown that methane emissions from oil and gas production are far larger than previously estimated.
To address the issue, the Obama administration had proposed new regulations that would have required, among other measures, that oil and gas companies install technology to detect and fix methane leaks from their wells, pipelines and storage facilities.
But a coalition of oil and gas companies pushed the Trump administration to abandon those rules. It said the industry was already regulated by state laws and was already equipped to plug leaks on its own without federal rules. Lobbyists argued that the companies were already incentivized to rein in methane emissions, given that gas is a valuable resource.
“The oil and natural gas industry has a pure economic incentive to prevent every molecule of ‘pollutant’ from escaping to the atmosphere,” wrote James D. Elliott, a lawyer representing a coalition of oil and gas groups led by the Independent Petroleum Association, including the North Dakota Petroleum Council, in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency on Nov. 25, 2019.
But speaking a few months earlier, at the June 2019 meeting, Mr. Ness appeared to contradict that argument. There is such a glut of natural gas, he said, that some producers that drill primarily for oil have little use for the gas that comes up with it. Yet “you’ve got to manage your gas to produce your oil.”
The pushback against more stringent methane rules has been led by smaller, independent producers who argued the rules were unfairly burdensome for smaller drillers, because they could not afford to invest in costly leak-detection and capture technology.
Oil giants like BP, on the other hand, urged the federal government to keep methane regulations in place, saying it was “the right thing to do.”
But ceding to the smaller operators’ demands, the Trump administration has proposed to eliminate federal methane rules in a move that would also reopen the question of whether the E.P.A. has the legal authority to regulate methane as a pollutant. The weakening of the methane standard is the latest in a long list of environmental-policy rollbacks under President Trump, who has vowed to loosen regulations on industry.
At the Colorado meeting, executives also worried about a potential backlash against the industry, particularly among younger voters. Recent surveys have shown a sharp rise in the number of Americans who feel passionately about climate change, and the issue appears likely to play a more prominent role in this year’s presidential election than in previous ones. 
“Young voters, female voters, Hispanic voters, really every sector except for older conservative male voters,” Ryan Flynn of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association said in the recording of the meeting, “their No. 1 issue when it comes to our industry is always going to be environmental stewardship, and concerns about what we’re doing with the environment.”
Dan Haley, president of the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, laid out the stakes.
“Hippies were going to change the world, until they wanted to get a job and buy a BMW,” Mr. Haley said in the meeting. “In Colorado, we’ve been kind of playing a game of whack-a-mole. We went from where fracking was the dirty word, and contaminated your water. And we inundated them with information about that and blitzed the TV airwaves,” he said. “Then slowly that changed into a health and safety messaging. And so we’re ramping up our health and safety messaging.”
Climate change was “the prism through which everything is being viewed,” Mr. Haley added. “We have to be comfortable talking about it, talking about how we are part of the solution through natural gas. And again, hitting people with emotions hitting them where they’re where their heart is.”  
“The activists are doing this when they talk about banning fracking in Colorado. They don’t show explosions. They don’t show rigs. They show women and children,” he said. “We have got to begin playing at that same emotional level or we will not win these battles.”
Scott Prestidge, a spokesman for Mr. Haley, said it was difficult to confirm the accuracy of a transcript from 2019, but said it was pretty clear that the remarks about the hippies were “said tongue-in-cheek."
He added: “In Colorado, the men and women of this industry live and work within the communities where oil and natural gas are being developed. They care about clean air, clean water, and in protecting their family’s safety and their community.”
In an interview, Mr. Flynn said that he had merely been expressing what he described as widely held concerns about oil and gas’s effects on the environment that he thought the industry needed to better address.
And he said attitudes toward regulations were changing, even among smaller oil and gas producers. For instance, during the Obama administration his organization opposed stronger federal methane regulations. However, it did not back the more recent efforts to repeal those rules.
“We absolutely need to address young people’s, all people’s, concerns about climate change,” Mr. Flynn said. “We’ve taken criticism at times from our peers that we are engaging on these issues,” he said. “But it’s critical for the future of our industry.”

WASHINGTON -- It's been a defining phrase of the Donald Trump presidency, ''Energy dominance,'' a doctrine that emphasizes the expansion of coal and oil production as well as the weakening of environmental regulations, including those that address climate change. 
  But at every turn, according to a broad scientific report on climate change issued last week, rising global temperatures threaten to undermine the president's vision of an energy-dominant America. The blackouts and other energy disruptions of Hurricane Harvey were just harbingers, the report said. Across the United States, every element of the country's energy infrastructure, like oil wells and nuclear power plants, will be stressed by droughts, heat waves, rising seas and fiercer storms.
  ''Climate change disrupts everything, including Trump's agenda,'' said Alice Hill, a research fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution think tank who served as senior director for resilience policy on the National Security Council under President Barack Obama.
  When it comes to fossil fuel production, the disruptions are particularly serious. And there's a fundamental irony at play. Even as emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are warming the planet, the consequences of that warming will make it harder to drill for oil, mine for coal and deliver fuel through pipelines.
  Mr. Trump wants to boost oil and gas drilling on public lands in the West, but drought is expected to affect the water necessary for hydraulic fracturing, the technique of injecting vast amounts of liquid into the bedrock to force out natural gas or oil. In the Arctic, where Mr. Trump has plans to open sensitive areas to oil drilling, equipment built to withstand Alaska's freezing temperatures is particularly vulnerable to permafrost melting as the state warms at twice the rate of the rest of the country.
  Coal-burning power plants are at risk as well. Rising temperatures from extreme heat events, the report notes, are expected to reduce their capacity to generate power and hamper the efficiency of the transmission grid.
  The national climate report, mandated by Congress and made public by the White House, makes the case that global warming ''is transforming where and how we live and presents growing challenges to human health.'' Soon after publication, however, President Trump and several members of his cabinet disavowed it. ''I don't believe it,'' Mr. Trump said of the findings.
  President Trump's call for energy dominance has been a central ambition of his administration. He hit on the slogan in the early days of his presidency, predicting a ''golden era of American energy'' that would be asserted via the country's booming natural gas, coal and petroleum exports.
  Cabinet officials have taken up the mantra.
  Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in announcing last year a lease sale of nearly 80 million acres of federal waters off the Gulf of Mexico, described it as ''a pillar of President Trump's plan to make the United States energy dominant.'' Energy Secretary Rick Perry has described energy dominance as ''exporting freedom,'' particularly by delivering America's liquefied natural gas and developing offshore oil drilling.
  Even at the Environmental Protection Agency, where the core mission is to ensure clean air and water, Andrew Wheeler, the acting administrator, has heralded ways he and his staff have advanced the president's energy dominance agenda by saving polluting industries billions of dollars in regulatory costs.
  The findings from the National Climate Assessment, issued by 13 federal agencies, come as the new House Democratic majority prepares to conduct oversight next year into Mr. Trump's rollbacks of federal climate change policies. Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, who is expected to chair the House Science Committee, is part of a group of lawmakers planning two days of hearings in January into ways to both reduce planet-warming emissions and prepare for the consequences of rising temperatures.
  ''Our rapidly changing climate, and the Trump administration's efforts to take us in the wrong direction, seriously jeopardize our future,'' Ms. Johnson said.
  Energy infrastructure is an expensive part of the problem, according to the assessment. The report does not provide firm estimates of expected costs. It does cite the fact that Hurricane Sandy in 2012, which resulted in gasoline lines stretching for miles, inoperable refineries and electricity outages affecting 8.7 million people, prodded utility companies in New York and New Jersey to invest billions of dollars in upgrades like elevating equipment and redesigning electrical networks to withstand extreme weather.
  The report notes that Con Edison and Public Service Electric and Gas have invested about $2 billion in repairs in response to recent hurricanes. It also points out that the costs to reconstruct Puerto Rico's electricity systems in the wake of Hurricanes Irma and Maria are estimated around $17 billion.
  And while the report notes that energy companies and utilities are increasingly taking steps to harden their infrastructure -- like planning for sea-level rise when building infrastructure -- experts said the federal government needs to do more.
  ''When you lose access to energy, your entire economy grinds to a halt,'' said Jason Bordoff, director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University and a former White House energy adviser to President Obama during Hurricane Sandy.
  ''The report lays out clearly the extent to which so many aspects of the nation's critical infrastructure are at risk from climate change,'' Mr. Bordoff said.
  Energy systems in the Southeast are particularly vulnerable, the report said, with some 200 power plants and oil refineries exposed to flooding from hurricanes and fiercer storm surges. Scientists estimate, if sea levels rise nationally 3.3 feet (a figure it describes as on the ''high end of the very likely range'' for what the country could see by 2100), it could expose dozens of power plants currently considered to be in safe zones to risks of 100-year floods. That would jeopardize about 25 gigawatts of operating power capacity, or power for about 18 million homes.
  Along the Gulf Coast -- home to a significant proportion of the United States oil production and refining industry -- energy infrastructure faces a similar and more immediate risk. A sea level rise of less than 1.6 feet could double the number of refineries in Texas and Louisiana vulnerable to flooding by the end of the century.
  Yet energy analysts cautioned against expectations that the effects of climate change will cause irreparable harm to the fossil fuel industry or make oil, gas and coal production fundamentally unattractive to investors. Sarah Ladislaw, an energy analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that the oil and gas sector has a long history of managing risks, including figuring out how to operate in politically unstable countries and prodding governments to loosen regulations they find too burdensome.
  Climate change will add ''headwinds'' to fossil fuel companies, make production more costly in some areas and less competitive in others, Ms. Ladislaw said. But, she added, ''If you're waiting for climate impacts to be the end of the oil and gas industry, that's not going to happen.''

In 1988, when world leaders convened their first global conference on climate change, in Toronto, the Earth's average temperature was a bit more than half a degree Celsius above the average of the last two decades of the 19th century, according to measurements by NASA.
Global emissions of greenhouse gases amounted to the equivalent of some 30 billion tons of carbon dioxide a year -- excluding those from deforestation and land use. Worried about its accumulation, the gathered scientists and policymakers called on the world to cut CO2 emissions by a fifth. 
  That didn't happen, of course. By 1997, when climate diplomats from the world's leading nations gathered to negotiate a round of emissions cuts in Kyoto, Japan, emissions had risen to some 35 billion tons and the global surface temperature was roughly 0.7 of a degree Celsius above the average of the late 19th century.
  It took almost two decades for the next breakthrough. When diplomats from virtually every country gathered in Paris just over two years ago to hash out another agreement to combat climate change, the world's surface temperature was already about 1.1 degrees Celsius above its average at the end of the 1800s. And greenhouse gas emissions totaled just under 50 billion tons.
  This is not to belittle diplomacy. Maybe this is the best we can do. How can countries be persuaded to adopt expensive strategies to drop fossil fuels when the prospective impact of climate change remains uncertain and fixing the problem requires collective action? As mitigation by an individual country will benefit all, nations will be tempted to take a free ride on the efforts of others. And no country will be able to solve the problem on its own.
  Still, the world's diplomatic meanderings -- from the ineffectual call in Toronto for a reduction in emissions to the summit meeting in Paris, where each country was allowed simply to pledge whatever it could to the global effort -- suggest that the diplomats, policymakers and environmentalists trying to slow climate change still cannot cope with its unforgiving math. They are, instead, trying to ignore it. And that will definitely not work.
  The world is still warming. Both NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported last week that global temperatures last year receded slightly from the record-setting 2016, because there was no El Niño heating up the Pacific.
  While the world frets over President Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement, I would argue that the greatest impediment to slowing this relentless warming is an illusion of progress that is allowing every country to sidestep many of the hard choices that still must be made.
  ''We keep doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome,'' said Scott Barrett, an expert on international cooperation and coordination at Columbia University who was once a lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
  Climate diplomats in Paris didn't merely reassert prior commitments to keep the world's temperature less than 2 degrees above that of the ''preindustrial'' era -- a somewhat fuzzy term that could be taken to mean the second half of the 19th century. Hoping to appease island nations like the Maldives, which are likely to be swallowed by a rising ocean in a few decades, they set a new ''aspirational'' ceiling of 1.5 degrees.
  To stick to a 2-degree limit, we would have to start reducing global emissions for real within about a decade at most -- and then do more. Half a century from now, we would have to figure out how to suck vast amounts of carbon out of the air. Keeping the lid at 1.5 degrees would be much harder still.
  Yet when experts tallied the offers made in Paris by all the countries in the collective effort, they concluded that greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 would exceed the level needed to remain under 2 degrees by 12 billion to 14 billion tons of CO2.
  Are there better approaches? The ''climate club'' proposed by the Yale University economist William Nordhaus has the advantage of including an enforcement device, which current arrangements lack: Countries in the club, committed to reducing carbon emissions, would impose a tariff on imports from nonmembers to encourage them to join.
  Martin Weitzman of Harvard University supports the idea of a uniform worldwide tax on carbon emissions, which might be easier to agree on than a panoply of national emissions cuts. One clear advantage is that countries could use their tax revenues as they saw fit.
  Mr. Barrett argues that the Paris agreement could be supplemented with narrower, simpler deals to curb emissions of particular gases -- such as the 2016 agreement at a 170-nation meeting in Kigali, Rwanda, to reduce hydrofluorocarbon emissions -- or in particular industries, like aviation or steel.
  Maybe none of this would work. The climate club could blow up if nonmembers retaliated against import tariffs by imposing trade barriers of their own. Coordinating taxes around the world looks at least as difficult as addressing climate change. And Mr. Barrett's proposal might not deliver a breakthrough on the scale necessary to move the dial.
  But what definitely won't suffice is a climate strategy built out of wishful thinking: the proposition that countries can be cajoled and prodded into increasing their ambition to cut emissions further, and that laggards can be named and shamed into falling into line.
  Inveigled by three decades of supposed diplomatic progress -- coupled with falling prices of wind turbines, solar panels and batteries -- the activists, technologists and policymakers driving the strategy against climate change seem to have concluded that the job can be done without unpalatable choices. And the group is closing doors that it would do best to keep open.
  There is no momentum for investing in carbon capture and storage, since it could be seen as condoning the continued use of fossil fuels. Nuclear energy, the only source of low-carbon power ever deployed at the needed scale, is also anathema. Geoengineering, like pumping aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect the sun's heat back into space, is another taboo.
  But eventually, these options will most likely be on the table, as the consequences of climate change come more sharply into focus. The rosy belief that the world can reduce its carbon dependency over a few decades by relying exclusively on the power of shame, the wind and the sun will give way to a more realistic understanding of possibilities.
  Some set of countries will decide to forget Paris and deploy a few jets to pump sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere to cool the world temporarily. There will be a race to develop techniques to harvest and store carbon from the atmosphere, and another to build nuclear generators at breakneck speed.
  It will probably be too late to prevent the Maldives from ending up underwater. But better late than never.

The “blob” of hotter ocean water that killed sea lions and other marine life in 2014 and 2015 may become permanent.
Six years ago, a huge part of the Pacific Ocean near North America quickly warmed, reaching temperatures more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. Nicknamed “the blob,” it persisted for two years, with devastating impacts on marine life, including sea lions and salmon.
The blob was a marine heat wave, the oceanic equivalent of a deadly summer atmospheric one. It was far from a solitary event: Tens of thousands have occurred in the past four decades, although most are far smaller and last for days rather than years. The largest and longest ones have occurred with increasing frequency over time.
On Thursday, scientists revealed the culprit. Climate change, they said, is making severe marine heat waves much more likely.
The study, published in the journal Science, looked at the blob and six other large events around the world, including one in the Northwest Atlantic in 2012. Human-caused global warming made these events at least 20 times more likely, the researchers found.
“Some of these couldn’t even have occurred without climate change,” said Charlotte Laufkötter, a marine scientist at the University of Bern in Switzerland and the lead author of the study.
In a world with no human-caused warming, a large marine heat wave would have had about a one-tenth of 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year — what is called a thousand-year event. But with the current rate of global warming, an ocean heat wave like that could soon have as much as a 10 percent chance of occurring, the study found.
Dr. Laufkötter said the likelihood of these large events would continue to increase as the world keeps warming. And if emissions of greenhouse gases continue at a high level for decades and average global temperatures reach about 5 degrees above preindustrial levels, some parts of the oceans may be in a continuous state of extreme heat.
In effect, the blob may become permanent. Already, a marine heat wave resembling the blob has emerged in the past year off northwestern North America.
Pippa Moore, a marine ecologist at Newcastle University in England who was not involved in the study, said earlier research had found links between climate change and major marine heat waves.
So the new study isn’t surprising, she said. “But what’s really nice is they’ve done a formal attribution study that shows it.”
An attribution study looks for the connection, if any, between climate change and extreme weather events by comparing simulations of the current warming world with simulations of a world in which human activity had not pumped billions of tons of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. These kinds of studies have been done for many events on land, including atmospheric heat waves and extreme rainfall, but very few have been done on marine heat waves.
The oceans absorb most of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases. But Dr. Moore, who studies the ecological impacts of these heat waves, said it is how fast the water warms, rather than its ultimate temperature, that is most damaging to marine organisms. “That rate of heat rising is just too quick for their physiology to cope with,” she said. “It leads to reduced growth rates, heightened risk of disease and greater mortality.”
But for sea lions and some other creatures, she said, the effects may be indirect. The heat wave may cause a source of food to die off or migrate. Heat waves can also lead to toxic algae blooms that can kill fish.
The events can affect humans, too. The blob in the Pacific may have influenced weather patterns on the West Coast, worsening drought in California, for example. The 2012 heat wave in the Atlantic affected the lobster harvest in the Gulf of Maine and raised trade tensions between the United States and Canada.
There are many reasons the heat waves form, Dr. Moore said, including the influence of large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions like El Niño. The blob was affected by a persistent ridge of high-pressure air over western North America that allowed stagnant air to linger over the ocean, leading to rapid warming.
A separate study published on Tuesday in Nature Communications identified a novel mechanism by which a heat wave could develop: through the compounding effects of two successive extreme weather events.
That study showed that a 2018 marine heat wave off the Gulf Coast formed when the passage of a tropical storm, Gordon, in early September was followed by an atmospheric heat wave.
Brian Dzwonkowski, a researcher at the University of South Alabama and the Dauphin Island Sea Lab, and the study’s lead author, said the tropical storm had stirred cold water up from the bottom, mixing it with warm surface water to make uniformly warm conditions. The atmospheric heat wave then warmed the waters further, putting them past the heat threshold that defines a marine heat wave.
The relatively shallow coastal waters were “supercharged from top to bottom,” Dr. Dzwonkowski said.
In mid-October another tropical cyclone, Hurricane Michael, came along. The warm water helped it rapidly strengthen to a powerful Category 5 storm, with a devastating result. Nearly 60 people were killed when the hurricane made landfall in Florida.

WASHINGTON --  In the absence of global action to curb greenhouse gas emissions, the United States by the end of the century may face up to $180 billion in economic losses because of drought and water shortages, according to a report released Monday by the White House and Environmental Protection Agency.
White House officials said the report, which analyzes the economic costs of a changing climate across 20 sectors of the American economy, is the most comprehensive effort to date to quantify the impacts of global warming. 
  The report comes as President Obama is trying to build political support both at home and abroad for an ambitious climate change agenda. During the president's six and a half years in office, the E.P.A. has released a series of regulations and legal decisions aimed at reining in planet-warming greenhouse gases from cars, trucks, power plants and airplanes. Mr. Obama hopes to use those regulations as leverage to broker a United Nations accord in Paris this December that would commit all nations to enacting similar emissions cuts.
  ''That's what we're going to use to push other countries to join in global climate action,'' said Brian Deese, Mr. Obama's senior climate and energy policy adviser.
  The report, ''Climate Change in the United States: Benefits of Global Action,'' used existing scientific and economic studies on the projected impacts of unchecked global climate change emissions. It compared those with a future in which global emissions are reduced enough to prevent a rise in average atmospheric temperatures of 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, the point at which, scientists say, the planet will be locked into an irreversible future of rising sea levels, stronger storms, extreme drought, food shortages and other damages.
  The report was conducted by the E.P.A.'s Office of Atmospheric Programs along with researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and scientific laboratories run by the Energy Department. The results were peer reviewed in scientific literature, and the summary report was independently reviewed by seven external experts.
  The report found that global policy to curb climate change could prevent 12,000 deaths from extreme heat and cold, or what it estimated as $200 billion in savings to the American economy by 2100. It also said climate policy could prevent 720 to 2,200 bridges from becoming structurally vulnerable for an estimated savings by the end of the century of $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion.
  In addition, the report found that climate policy could prevent $50 million to $6.4 billion in adaptation costs to urban drainage systems, which could be flooded by extreme storms.
  If climate change is mitigated, the report found a 40 percent to 59 percent reduction in probability of extreme drought, which would otherwise cost American farmers $2.6 billion to $3.1 billion.
  Unchecked climate change could lead to the destruction by wildfire of six million to 7.9 million acres of forest, the report found, at a cost of $940 million to $1.4 billion. And it could lead to the destruction of ecosystems such as coral reefs that support economic activity, including 35 percent of the coral reefs in Hawaii, at a loss of $1.2 billion.
  White House officials hope to marshal the numbers to counter political opposition to Mr. Obama's climate change agenda. Republicans and the coal industry have criticized it as regulatory overreach that could shut down some industries and cost jobs, particularly in coal mining. In August, the E.P.A. is expected to unveil the centerpiece of Mr. Obama's climate change policy, a set of regulations designed to cut emissions from coal-fired power plants, the largest contributor to the American greenhouse gas footprint.
  Once enacted, the rules could lead to the closing of hundreds of such coal plants, and freeze demand for production of American coal. By pushing for other countries to enact similar policies, Mr. Obama is also trying to lower demand for coal consumption around the world.
  The regulations will also force electric utilities to build new generators to produce electricity with less pollution, from wind, solar, nuclear and natural gas plants. The construction will require thousands of miles of new electric transmission lines, all of which could drive up electricity costs and lead to lower power reliability, according to the heads of some electric utilities.
  ''The results are quite startling and very clear,'' Gina McCarthy, the administrator of the E.P.A., said in a news briefing with reporters. ''It's very clear that climate action now pays. It saves lives and cuts costs. These are really big numbers, and we can limit the losses if we act now.''
  Mr. Obama hopes to make the case that the long-term economic benefits of taking action on climate change will outweigh the short and medium-term costs.

Highlight: Bets for avoiding the worst droughts, wildfires and floods also include Portland, Me., San Francisco, Detroit and — surprise — New York City.

It’s hard to imagine that any city in North America will escape the effects of climate change within the next 25 years.
But some will be better positioned than others to escape the brunt of “drought, wildfire, extreme heat, extreme precipitation, extreme weather and hurricanes.”
Those were some of the climate change-related threats listed by Benjamin Strauss, who focuses on climate impacts at Climate Central, an independent nonprofit research collaboration of scientists and journalists.
Dr. Strauss, 44, identified cities where people could settle in the next two decades if they are aiming to avoid those threats.
“Cities are certainly all going to be livable over the next 25 years, but they’ll be increasingly feeling the heat,” Dr. Strauss said, adding that political action could help cities mitigate the effects of climate change.
I also spoke with David W. Titley, 58, a professor of meteorology at Penn State University, and Katharine Hayhoe, 44, a professor of political science at Texas Tech University who works with cities to build resilience to climate risks.
Just because a city isn’t mentioned within this piece does not mean it is not a good bet. My advice: If you’re looking for a place to live, pay attention to the qualities of the cities more than the specific locations.
All three emphasized that while certain cities were better bets, their safety was relative.
“I don’t care if you found the safest place in the U.S.,” Dr. Titley said. “We’re all going to pay, we’re all going to suffer that economic disruption, we’re all going to pay for that relocation.”
Portland, Me.
My gut feeling before I talked to the scientists was that landlocked cities would be safer than those on the coasts. But Dr. Strauss set me straight.
“I don’t think that I would restrict myself to only landlocked cities,” he said. “There certainly are some coastal cities that are better positioned to weather rising seas than others.”
One, he said, is Portland, which is well situated in the north and has a hilly topography.
Dr. Titley agreed that Portland was a solid option.
“Portland is high enough that certainly for the next few centuries it not going to have significant sea-level rise,” he said. “In general, cities north of 40 degrees latitude are not going to have the same type of systemic drought issues as cities further to the south.”
 A Midwestern trifecta: Detroit, Chicago and Madison, Wis.
Cities near the Great Lakes are reasonable options, all three scientists said.
“That region is probably one of the safest from a climate perspective,” Dr. Strauss said.
“The Northeast and Midwest are going to have plenty of water, and they’re not going to be subject to coastal flood issues,” he said. “The Great Lakes are very much an advantage as a water supply.”
He said that Midwestern cities would have to invest in more air-conditioning and would probably experience more extreme rainfall than other regions. But he said that they would not see the “dangerous heat that we’ll be seeing in the southwest and the southeast.”
But Dr. Hayhoe said that in the Midwestern cities, particularly Chicago, flooding will be a risk, saying that there had been a nearly 45 percent increase in heavy precipitation events in the Midwest since the 1950s.
San Francisco
Dr. Strauss was bullish on San Francisco and other cities along the northwest coast, saying that they would be insulated against “miserable hot weather” and wouldn’t have much of a problem with sea level rise.
Dr. Titley said he was a “little less sanguine about the West Coast as a place to ‘escape climate change.’”
He said that San Francisco, which already struggles with economic inequality, would be far more welcoming to those in a better position financially.
“People with resources have more adaptive capability,” he said. “So the people with fewer resources are the ones that, unless we have a system to take care of them, are going to suffer disproportional impacts.”
“That is a very legitimate policy and political decision,” he said, “as opposed to the silliness of arguing whether climate change is happening.”
Boise, Idaho 
Dr. Titley said Boise might be a safer bet than some of the West Coast cities.
But he also warned of wildfires in the Boise region, adding that the city itself was likely safer from that risk.
“If somebody pointed a gun at me and said, ‘Boise or Denver, choose one on a climate-related basis,’ I would choose Boise,” he said. “That would be pretty easy.”
Dr. Strauss agreed that from a climate perspective, Boise outranked Denver and other Southwestern cities like Tucson and Phoenix.
“The drought risk is lower, the heat risk is lower,” he said.
Forest fires don’t often affect large cities directly, but they do affect air quality, something that Dr. Strauss said was “not to be understated as an issue.”
New York City
Perhaps the biggest surprise to me during my conversations with the scientists was their general enthusiasm for New York City. Dr. Strauss and Dr. Titley said the city seemed serious about evaluating the risks of climate change.
Dr. Strauss mentioned a comprehensive environmental program, PlaNYC, proposed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2007, and said that the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio had            embraced that path.
“New York City has some landscape advantages and has some landscape challenges,” he said. “But it also has a lot of resources and is beginning to invest in preparing for higher seas. It has a long way to go, but it recognizes that and is beginning the journey. “
Dr. Titley said the city would remain relatively safe from climate change except in the lowest-lying areas, like Lower Manhattan.
“I would argue that the governance in New York City has been more progressive than in many places on this issue,” he said.
State College, Pa.
Dr. Titley recommended State College, which is home to Pennsylvania State University. He said that the city’s climate resistance was a consideration when he and his wife moved there three years ago.
“Our average temperatures, in the summertime, we’ll get maybe a few days above 90 degrees,” he said. “Our winter times are mild compared to New York State and New England. We’ll probably be O.K. with water.”
Toronto
Dr. Hayhoe said Toronto’s developed infrastructure, financial system and public services were not likely to be affected by rising sea levels or water shortages.
And she made a final point about cities’ vulnerability to climate change.
“Two-thirds of the world’s biggest cities are within a few feet of sea level,” she said. “If sea level were rising a thousand years ago, when people lived in tents, then if you lived in Houston, New Orleans, New York, Mumbai or Shanghai, you’d pick up your tents and you’d move.
She pointed out that many of the seven and a half billion people on earth “are living in an increasingly urbanized environment within reach of the sea level rise that will occur this century. That is one of the biggest reasons we care about a changing climate.”

Six years ago in Copenhagen, Hillary Clinton, then secretary of state, brought the moribund negotiations on a deal to slow climate change back from the dead with a single promise of $100 billion a year to help the world's poor nations. 
  The world's advanced industrial nations committed to ''mobilizing jointly $100 billion a year by 2020, to address the needs of developing countries.'' The money was to come from ''a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance.''
  Halfway toward that target date, policy makers are preparing for yet another climate conclave in Paris starting at the end of November. It is shaping up to be the most important yet, drawing in every country -- rich and poor -- to the collective effort against a changing climate, which poses its greatest immediate threat in places like Bangladesh and sub-Saharan Africa.
  But where's the money?
  ''Financing is the most challenging aspect of the whole deal,'' Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, told me over the summer. ''There is no credible road map to the $100 billion.''
  Once a leader in the effort to muster money to help the world's poor tackle climate change, the United States these days plays a more modest role. Facing complicated budgetary politics, Washington is having a hard time putting its money where its mouth was six years ago.
  To be sure, the world has made progress. This week, France promised $5.6 billion in annual climate-related assistance by 2020, up from some $3.4 billion today. Britain also pledged to increase its budget for climate-related development finance.
  ''We are well on our way to achieving this $100 billion goal,'' Secretary of State John Kerry said after a meeting of rich countries in Paris this month to discuss climate finance.
  Still, there's a long way to go. ''We are at $50 billion for sure,'' said one knowledgeable European diplomat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the negotiations. ''But something like $30- to $40 billion in new money will have to be mobilized between now and 2020.''
  Beyond the target itself looms a critical question: What counts as the right sort of aid? 
  ''We still don't have an internationally agreed definition of what is climate finance,'' noted Barbara K. Buchner, senior director of Climate Policy Initiative, a research center that is working with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to build a consistent estimate of the money mobilized so far.
  The Copenhagen Accord promised ''additional'' funds, but what share of the new climate assistance should be new money? To what extent are the rich countries allowed to repurpose other aid, or relabel assistance that happens to have climate-related side effects?
  ''While there is a lot of overlap between the climate and development, it is not the same thing,'' said Rajiv Shah, who headed the United States Agency for International Development until earlier this year. ''If we start cutting vaccines for poor countries to meet climate obligations, we will be doing a disservice to the world.''
  There are differences of opinion on how to count aid from the World Bank and other multilateral agencies in which the poor countries are shareholders, too. There are disagreements on the form that aid should take: Developing countries prefer grants; some rich countries prefer loans. A lot of the French money, for instance, is supposed to be paid back.
  And there are big differences of opinion about what counts as ''mobilized'' private money. Poor nations urgently need financial resources to steel themselves against volatile, unpredictable weather. Foreign capital, however, is more interested in pursuing potentially lucrative renewable energy deals.
  A critical disagreement is about how to distinguish private investment that would not have happened in the absence of public efforts from that which would have gone ahead anyway.
  ''There are not many developed countries with a lot of free cash,'' said Jake Schmidt, director of the international program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''The question is, how do we create innovative financing?''
  The donor countries with the most constrained budgets are pushing the boundaries of innovation.
  Take the United States, where Republicans are hoping to block the $3 billion promised by President Obama last year to the United Nations' Green Climate Fund. The United States is arguing for an optimistic reading of ''mobilization,'' which delivers the most private bang for the public buck. It is also pushing hard to count assistance from multilateral institutions as help from the developed world.
  ''The United States is trying to paint a rosier picture than it is, to avoid a difficult discussion,'' the European diplomat said.
  The Obama administration argues it is hardly dragging its feet. ''The U.S. has contributed substantial climate finance to poor countries in recent years, including $12.8 billion from 2010 to 2014,'' a United States government official said.
  In any case, the United States is not alone. ''The rogue countries are those who have a hard case to build,'' said Athena Ballesteros, in charge of sustainable finance at the World Resources Institute, an environmental research and advocacy organization. ''The U.S. and Japan and to a certain extent Australia and the U.K.''
  Reaching $100 billion is essential more for its diplomatic significance than for its actual impact on climate change.
  Consider it a down payment intended to encourage countries to redouble efforts to cut carbon emissions and deal with increasingly bad weather in future years. The most important change requires redirecting trillions of dollars now flowing into carbon-heavy energy projects into clean alternatives.
  The $100 billion is needed for everything else to fall into place. Many poor countries still have a hard time accepting they must contribute to fix a problem largely created by the carbon-intensive development of the rich. They fear that moving their energy supply away from fossil fuels and even more primitive sources like wood and dung will block their path out of poverty.
  ''It's kind of like a trust piece for developing countries,'' said Jennifer Morgan, global director of the climate program at the World Resources Institute. ''And it's the easiest tool to block progress for those who want to block progress.''
  Is a deal doable? For sure. But the path is narrow. A tight, uncompromising definition of aid would condemn the process to failure. But if advanced nations resort to obvious gimmickry to meet their promise, it would weaken the glue holding together a still fragile world coalition.
  Both rich and poor nations must compromise: Donor nations will not come up with $100 billion in entirely new money, beyond whatever development assistance they provided before. Certainly they will not come up with $100 billion of purely public funds. But they will have to come up with something meaningful.
  A World Resources Institute report estimated that $10 billion to $14 billion in government money for climate finance on top of the $17 billion deployed in 2012 would be enough to seal a deal.
  ''There has to be additional concessional public climate finance,'' Ms. Ballesteros said. ''It's not about the dollar figure per se but about the quality of the number and the type of money.''
  As for the United States -- still the most important player -- Congress must take note. Pledging cash is not enough. Money must be appropriated.

Also this week, the U.N. climate talks in Madrid
Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. (And find the website version of this week's letter here.) 
  When we think about food waste, we usually think about individual households. Example: those sad looking carrots at the bottom of the fridge drawer. Your fault, your loss. Not a broader concern.
  But those carrots are part of a systemic problem, one with grave implications for climate change. Project Drawdown ranked reducing food waste as the third most important step out of 80 proposed solutions.
  If food waste were a country, it would be the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. In the United States alone, food waste generates the same amount of greenhouse gas emissions as 37 million cars, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. That accounts for both the energy used in agriculture to grow unused food, as well as the methane that's released when the food rots in landfills.
  That's the bad news. 
  The good news is that cities are coming up with solutions. Because most municipalities run their own sanitation systems, said Yvette Cabrera, deputy food waste director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, they're ''uniquely positioned to tackle the problem.'' 
  Here are three main strategies cities are using.
  Target waste 
  Those sanitation systems give cities a lot of control over what happens to discarded food, and some are cracking down on waste.
  Seoul, South Korea, for example, charges a fee for food waste. Families pay by weight. At recycling sites, the waste is processed: Part is used for biofuels, while some is turned into fertilizer to help urban farms. The city also has over 6,000 automated bins where residents can weigh their food waste and pay their fees, according to the World Economic Forum.
  Seoul now recycles 95 percent of its food waste, up from less than 2 percent in 1995.
  A version of that was tried in the United States in 2015, when Seattle introduced an anti-waste program that, among other things, made it illegal to toss out food. A year later, a judge tossed out the measure's enforcement provision when she ruled it was unconstitutional for trash collectors to snooping in garbage for edible morsels. 
  The law is still on the books, though, and it appears to have had an effect. For example, the program included an education campaign that focused on waste reduction, smarter shopping and composting. The right kind of food composting system produces lower emissions than a similar volume of food in a landfill, and you get something useful from composting: fertilizer.
  Now, nearly 50 percent of food waste gets composted, according to Hans Van Dusen, the city's solid waste contracts manager. And, waste sent to landfills is at a record low of 0.81 pounds per person per day, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
  ''We are so disconnected from where our food comes from, we don't think about the resources that take to get it to us,'' said Veronica Fincher, a senior waste prevention program manager in Seattle. ''We want to help people understand those impacts.''
  For an example of what could happen if more cities tackled food waste, look to France. National law there requires large supermarkets to donate, rather than throw away, food that is still edible -- a measure that has sharply increased food donations to charities, according to the government.
  Businesses are key
  Cities tend to have lots of restaurants and grocery stores, and that presents a huge opportunity to reduce food waste.
  One of the leaders in working with supermarkets and chefs is New York City, which runs the largest composting program in the country. It's part of a multimillion-dollar program to cut down on greenhouse gas emissions by turning food scraps and yard waste into compost and, soon, clean energy. The goal is to get the city to zero waste by 2030.
  In addition to the composting program, the city runs a robust online food donation portal, food waste fairs and waste-reduction challenges that recognize successful efforts by restaurants and supermarkets.
  As of now, the city wastes four million tons of food a year. Of that, 500,000 tons come from restaurants. The state's Department of Environmental Conservation estimates that cutting commercial food waste by 5 percent would save more than 120,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere each year.
  ''Baby steps so far, but we want to be sure that restaurants have the tools to do well,'' said the city's sanitation commissioner, Kathryn Garcia. ''There are some seriously committed chefs out there to ensuring that nothing gets wasted.''
  Other cities have also introduced curbside recycling and incrementally expanded their food waste regulation, like Los Angeles, Denver and Baltimore, which are all setting public goals to decrease waste, expand curbside composting and work with chefs and restaurants to raise awareness about food waste reduction. 
  Redistribute the surplus
  So, some cities are saving a lot of food from the landfill. Some goes to the compost bin. Some, though, is still edible. What to do with it?
  That's where food rescue programs come into the picture. Strictly speaking, these are not climate programs. But think of them as an added bonus: Cities can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and help the needy.
  Milan, Italy has been a global leader in the rescue movement since 2015. That year, 15 tons of food was given to homeless people in just a few weeks when the chef Massimo Bottura helped to organize an anti-waste campaign. Since then, the city has written the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact, an international food waste protocol for cities, and led a charge that helped to get Italy's national government to pass food waste legislation.
  According to its organizers, the food policy pact has been signed by 207 cities from around the world with a total of around 450 million inhabitants.
  It shows how a local initiative can take off, and how cities can have an impact.
  ''Once you tell people they can't throw food away, they start making different, creative decisions with it,'' said Emily Broad Leib, the director of the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic.
  The second and final week of United Nations climate change talks in Madrid opened with a dash of optimism from the United States as a broad coalition of states, cities and businesses made a case that it could put a significant dent in planet-warming emissions without federal help. 
  Delivering the news was Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire and former mayor of New York City who is now running for president. Mr. Bloomberg co-founded the coalition, America's Pledge, along with Gov. Jerry Brown of California. Its purpose is to help the United States stick to the goals of the Paris climate agreement despite President Trump's plan to abandon the pact.
  ''The reason I am here in Madrid is really pretty simple,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''I am here because no one from the White House is here.'' 
  A coalition report, issued this week and titled ''Accelerating America's Pledge,'' found that, even without federal action, efforts to cut greenhouse gasses by the members of the group could have a significant impact.
  Critically, the report found that there's still time for the United States to hit net-zero emissions by midcentury. A recent United Nations report said countries would need to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. 
  The pledge authors project that with expanded local action, combined with a comprehensive national strategy that includes clean energy legislation and policies to complete the phaseout of coal, the United States could reduce its emissions 49 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.
  Left unsaid in the report, but explicitly noted by Mr. Bloomberg in a touch of electioneering, was that such national action would require an administration that prioritizes climate change.
  ''Beating climate change won't require a miracle, it won't require limitless resources,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''It will require leadership and common sense.''
  Under the rules of the Paris Agreement, the United States will remain a party to the accord until Nov. 4, 2020, the day after the presidential election.

New York’s attorney general is about to square off against the oil giant in court. 
The New York attorney general’s office will take its case against Exxon Mobil to trial on Tuesday, arguing that one of the world’s largest oil and gas companies misled its shareholders and the public by misrepresenting the risks that climate change poses to the value of its oil and gas assets.
The lawsuit is one of several the company is facing that if successful, would force Exxon Mobil, which took in some $290 billion in revenue last year, to account for the true costs of its nature-crushing fossil fuel business, making it less competitive with wind, solar and other renewable energy sources and thus accelerating the transition to a clean-energy economy.
This is Economics 101. It’s cheap to pollute if you don’t include the costs of the damage on your books. And for the world’s oil companies, those current and future damages are nearly incalculable if you consider how climate change is leading to the collapse of the planet’s diversity, and the financial losses and human suffering that will result from rising seas and temperatures. One recent study estimates that the world’s top 20 fossil fuel companies are responsible for 35 percent of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions since 1965. Exxon Mobil was the fourth-largest contributor on the list.
What makes this especially mind-numbing is that Exxon knew for decades that its business was altering the climate but repeatedly deceived the public, just as the tobacco companies knew their cigarettes caused cancer but denied it. The attorney general’s office, now under the command of Letitia James (her predecessor, Barbara Underwood, brought the suit)           argues that to mislead the investing public, Exxon “erected a Potemkin village to create the illusion that it had fully considered the risks of future climate change regulation.” But “in reality, Exxon knew that its representations were not supported by the facts and were contrary to its internal business practices.”
Exxon had denied wrongdoing and called the case politically motivated.
But in internal memos dating back to the 1970s, Exxon predicted that the effects of fossil fuel emissions could “indeed be catastrophic (at least for a substantial fraction of the world’s population).” In 1982 it estimated with stunning accuracy that the atmosphere would contain 415 parts per million of carbon dioxide this year and what that would mean for increased global temperatures. The parade of horribles foreseen by the company — sea level rise, more intense rain and snow, inundation, hotter temperatures, desertification, agricultural disruption — are now regular features of the nightly news. And it will only get worse.
But rather than warn the public, Exxon spent over $30 million on climate-denying think tanks and researchers to confuse the public about climate science — a confusion that persists to this day — while doubling down on its destructive business model.  More than half of all industrial carbon dioxide emissions were produced after Exxon heard the clarion call from its own scientists to change direction.
Exxon now concedes that climate change is happening because of the burning of fossil fuels, and it has spent a modest amount on low-carbon investments. Still the company plans to increase its oil output by 25 percent by 2025 at a time when the world should be sharply reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. Actions speak louder than words.
New York is just one front in a legal struggle against the fossil fuel industry, one that the organization I direct has been involved in by financing legal advocacy groups representing plaintiffs in two other lawsuits against the oil giant. Altogether, Exxon and other oil and gas companies are facing at least a dozen other lawsuits, primarily from municipalities, including New York City and Baltimore, and one state, Rhode Island, which want help paying for the substantial climate damages the companies have already caused.
For coastal communities, the cost of defending against rising seas alone will exceed $400 billion, according to a recent study by the Center for Climate Integrity, which the Rockefeller Family Fund supports. This, of course, doesn’t include other enormous expenses. Puerto Rico, Houston and towns in the Midwest are still reeling from climate-juiced storm systems that ravaged homes and infrastructure and led to the deaths of thousands of people. The burden of these costs will fall squarely on all of us who pay taxes unless the responsible climate polluters are required to pay their fair share.
These lawsuits are an important step for society to free itself from the grasp of this lethal industry. Most directly, the suits can provide the billions necessary for communities to repair climate damages and fortify their infrastructure for the storms ahead. And if these cases are successful, Big Oil will finally be forced to assume a greater portion of the costs they have foisted on taxpayers. Their business, which significantly lagged the S &amp; P 500 over the past five years, will take another deserved financial hit.
These cases are also teachable moments. We’re not in this mess because we heat our homes or drive our children to school, which is what the fossil fuel companies want us to think. We’re victims of a small group of gargantuan companies that recklessly and deliberately ignored the implications of their own science and unabashedly worked to deceive the public.
If you don’t believe me, then consider the words of the chief judge of the United States District Court in Rhode Island, William E. Smith, a George W. Bush appointee. In a procedural opinion in the state’s climate case against Exxon and other major oil and gas companies, Judge Smith wrote in July that those companies have “extracted, advertised, and sold a substantial percentage of the fossil fuels burned globally since the 1960s.” He continued: 
This activity has released an immense amount of greenhouse gas into the Earth’s atmosphere, changing its climate and leading to all kinds of displacement, death (extinctions, even), and destruction. What is more, defendants understood the consequences of their activity decades ago, when transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy would have saved a world of trouble. But instead of sounding the alarm, defendants went out of their way to becloud the emerging scientific consensus and further delay changes — however existentially necessary — that would in any way interfere with their multibillion-dollar profits. All while quietly readying their capital for the coming fallout.
That’s the case against Big Oil in a nutshell. The industry is based on a deceit. The companies know the planet is headed toward a climate catastrophe, but they keep drilling away, trying to squeeze the last nickel from their deadly product. It will be up to the judge overseeing the New York case, Barry Ostrager, to determine whether Exxon’s misrepresentations violated New York’s securities law, but when it comes to the moral repugnancy of the company’s climate deception, the verdict is in.
Lee Wasserman is the director of the            Rockefeller Family Fund. Among its goals is to accelerate the transformation away from fossil fuels by opposing additional fossil fuel infrastructure, drilling, mining and exporting.

Scientists Tie Deadly Heat 'Blob' In the Pacific to Climate Change

The ''blob'' of hotter ocean water that killed sea lions and other marine life in 2014 and 2015 may become permanent.
Six years ago, a huge part of the Pacific Ocean near North America quickly warmed, reaching temperatures more than 5 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. Nicknamed ''the blob,'' it persisted for two years, with devastating impacts on marine life, including sea lions and salmon. 
  The blob was a marine heat wave, the oceanic equivalent of a deadly summer atmospheric one. It was far from a solitary event: Tens of thousands have occurred in the past four decades, although most are far smaller and last for days rather than years. The largest and longest ones have occurred with increasing frequency over time.
  On Thursday, scientists revealed the culprit. Climate change, they said, is making severe marine heat waves much more likely.
  The study, published in the journal Science, looked at the blob and six other large events around the world, including one in the Northwest Atlantic in 2012. Human-caused global warming made these events at least 20 times more likely, the researchers found.
  ''Some of these couldn't even have occurred without climate change,'' said Charlotte Laufkötter, a marine scientist at the University of Bern in Switzerland and the lead author of the study.
  In a world with no human-caused warming, a large marine heat wave would have had about a one-tenth of 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year -- what is called a thousand-year event. But with the current rate of global warming, an ocean heat wave like that could soon have as much as a 10 percent chance of occurring, the study found.
  Dr. Laufkötter said the likelihood of these large events would continue to increase as the world keeps warming. And if emissions of greenhouse gases continue at a high level for decades and average global temperatures reach about 5 degrees above preindustrial levels, some parts of the oceans may be in a continuous state of extreme heat.
  In effect, the blob may become permanent. Already, a marine heat wave resembling the blob has emerged in the past year off northwestern North America.
  Pippa Moore, a marine ecologist at Newcastle University in England who was not involved in the study, said earlier research had found links between climate change and major marine heat waves.
  So the new study isn't surprising, she said. ''But what's really nice is they've done a formal attribution study that shows it.''
  An attribution study looks for the connection, if any, between climate change and extreme weather events by comparing simulations of the current warming world with simulations of a world in which human activity had not pumped billions of tons of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. These kinds of studies have been done for many events on land, including atmospheric heat waves and extreme rainfall, but very few have been done on marine heat waves.
  The oceans absorb most of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases. But Dr. Moore, who studies the ecological impacts of these heat waves, said it is how fast the water warms, rather than its ultimate temperature, that is most damaging to marine organisms. ''That rate of heat rising is just too quick for their physiology to cope with,'' she said. ''It leads to reduced growth rates, heightened risk of disease and greater mortality.''
  But for sea lions and some other creatures, she said, the effects may be indirect. The heat wave may cause a source of food to die off or migrate. Heat waves can also lead to toxic algae blooms that can kill fish.
  The events can affect humans, too. The blob in the Pacific may have influenced weather patterns on the West Coast, worsening drought in California, for example. The 2012 heat wave in the Atlantic affected the lobster harvest in the Gulf of Maine and raised trade tensions between the United States and Canada.
  There are many reasons the heat waves form, Dr. Moore said, including the influence of large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions like El Niño. The blob was affected by a persistent ridge of high-pressure air over western North America that allowed stagnant air to linger over the ocean, leading to rapid warming.
  A separate study published on Tuesday in Nature Communications identified a novel mechanism by which a heat wave could develop: through the compounding effects of two successive extreme weather events.
  That study showed that a 2018 marine heat wave off the Gulf Coast formed when the passage of a tropical storm, Gordon, in early September was followed by an atmospheric heat wave.
  Brian Dzwonkowski, a researcher at the University of South Alabama and the Dauphin Island Sea Lab, and the study's lead author, said the tropical storm had stirred cold water up from the bottom, mixing it with warm surface water to make uniformly warm conditions. The atmospheric heat wave then warmed the waters further, putting them past the heat threshold that defines a marine heat wave.
  The relatively shallow coastal waters were ''supercharged from top to bottom,'' Dr. Dzwonkowski said.
  In mid-October another tropical cyclone, Hurricane Michael, came along. The warm water helped it rapidly strengthen to a powerful Category 5 storm, with a devastating result. Nearly 60 people were killed when the hurricane made landfall in Florida.
