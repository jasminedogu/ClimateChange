With every passing month, the arguments for inaction on climate change are melting away faster than glaciers in Alaska. Let's take them one at a time. 
Argument No. 1: The science is uncertain. Actually, it's not. An overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that human activity is warming the planet. In fact, 2015 is on track to eclipse 2014 as the warmest year on record. This past summer was the hottest in recorded history, topping 2014 and even 1998, which featured an El Nino-driven spike that has allowed skeptics to claim, misleadingly, that temperatures haven't increased much since then.
Now, the previous peaks are being surpassed, mountain snows are disappearing, ice sheets are crumbling and sea levels are rising. Studies conclude that the increased heat is exacerbating extreme weather events, such as the severe drought in California and flooding in the eastern USA.
Argument No. 2: Other countries aren't doing anything about their greenhouse gas emissions, so the U.S. shouldn't bother.  This assertion once held a kernel of truth, but it doesn't any more. Ahead of international climate talks in Paris at the end of next month, China, the European Union, Brazil and India have made new pledges to address global warming.
Of these, China, the world's biggest carbon emitter, is the most important. Driven as much by short-term concerns about choking urban pollution as by long-term concerns about the planet, the Chinese have pledged to implement a carbon-trading plan in 2017 and have their emissions peak by about 2030.
This creates the ironic situation in which the communist Chinese are adopting a market-based approach to curb carbon emissions, while the Obama administration -- faced with an intransigent Republican-controlled Congress -- has to pursue top-down strategies that rely on government mandates.
Argument No. 3: Efforts to control emissions will tank the economy. The "do nothing" crowd focuses on how efforts to limit carbon emissions will raise electric rates. In areas that rely primarily on coal-burning power plants, that could well happen. But coal is already being displaced by cheaper, cleaner natural gas. And the critics ignore the costs, such as higher charges for air conditioning and storm damage, of inaction.
Annual insurance losses from extreme weather events, adjusted for inflation, have increased from about $10 billion in the 1980s to about $50 billion in the past decade. Lloyd's of London estimates that rising sea levels increased losses from Superstorm Sandy by 30% in New York alone. No wonder  so many businesses, outside the fossil fuel industry, are taking climate change seriously.
To the extent  there's good news, it's that the world is starting to respond with the sort of urgency the threat requires. Pope Francis has added an important moral dimension to the climate debate. Renewable energy sources, particularly solar, are becoming more competitive.
Whether all this will be enough to prevent catastrophic warming and disruption remains uncertain. What is certain, however, is that the case for denial and delay is growing weaker all the time.

Summit puts focus on tiny Pacific islands; Tuvalu is at risk of flooding from climate change

COPENHAGEN -- At the climate summit taking place here, nobody's a bigger celebrity than the delegation from the tiny island nation of Tuvalu.
The South Pacific chain of nine coral atolls is often held up by the United Nations and others as a pre-eminent example of a country at risk from global warming. Its 12,000 residents live in an area of  9 square miles, and its highest peak is 15 feet above sea level.
Tuvalu's government says that, if global warming causes seas to rise, all its people may have to be evacuated within 50 years.
"Climate change is real to us. It's happening now. It's a threat to our existence," Mataio Mataio, the head of Tuvalu's Department of Environment, said Tuesday.
Tuvalu is one of several nations that have come to Copenhagen to demand money from richer countries, including the USA, to help cope with the effects of global warming.
Yvo de Boer, the U.N.'s top climate change official, said industrialized nations should contribute $10 billion a year right away -- and potentially "hundreds of billions" a year in the longer term. The money would be used by poorer countries to repair damage caused by global warming, and to overhaul their own economies to pollute less.
Tuvalu's case shows why some skeptics say such plans may amount to a shakedown.
There is debate among academics as to whether Tuvalu's problems stem from global warming or other factors such as overpopulation. Some are also concerned that funds could be misappropriated because of corruption in poor countries.
"Ninety percent of the countries here in Copenhagen could be on the receiving end of this money, and that's why they're thirsting for a deal to get done," said global warming skeptic and author H. Leighton Steward. "I have some real doubts about whether that money's really needed, and whose pockets it would end up in."
The issue is shaping up as one of the most contentious at the U.N. summit, where representatives from 192 countries are trying to forge an agreement to limit emissions of greenhouse gases that the United Nations says threaten to warm the Earth to dangerous levels.
Poor countries -- including Bangladesh -- have said they won't agree to any deal that doesn't incorporate "mitigation funds." They argue that rich countries have a moral obligation to provide aid because they're the biggest polluters.
"We are suffering the most, but we have caused the problem the least," said Saber Hossain Chowdhury, the head of Bangladesh's parliamentary delegation to Copenhagen.
Warming not only problem
Tuvalu's problems predate worries over global warming.
The country, about 600 miles north of Fiji, has "no known mineral resources," and soil quality is poor, according to the CIA's World Factbook. Its people make their living primarily from farming, fishing and money sent by relatives abroad.
Mataio said there is "no doubt" that Tuvalu is already feeling the effects of global warming caused by the burning of fossil fuels. He said the primary symptoms are heavy coastal erosion and flooding that has become worse in recent decades. Tuvalu needs foreign aid to be able to build sea walls to guard against rising seas, Mataio said.
"That's the only way we can adapt," he said.
Mataio said the initial $10 billion a year proposed by De Boer would be insufficient once it was divided among all poor nations in need. "We need more," he said.
A report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said rising seas are "expected to threaten ... the livelihood of island communities."
However, a study released in May by EACH-FOR, a consortium of researchers supported by the European Commission, concluded that more research is still needed to determine the impact of global warming on Tuvalu.
That report cited water shortages, overpopulation and problems with trash disposal as environmental problems facing Tuvalu that are serious -- but separate from climate change. It also warned that too much public emphasis on global warming's potential impact might itself be driving people to leave the island.
"Constant portraying of Tuvalu as a doomed, disappearing nation might compromise its potential for future development," the EACH-FOR report said.
Francois Gemenne, a fellow at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations in Paris, spent two months in Tuvalu in 2007 helping research the report. He worries that some officials there may have a mistaken tendency to "attribute any environmental problem to climate change."
He noted that most of the vehicles driven in Tuvalu are SUVs. "They have to import everything," said Gemenne, who is in Copenhagen for the summit. "It's a tough place to live."
The hallways at the conference hall here are lined with exhibits from poor countries seeking redress for global warming.
Nigeria's booth has photos of gully erosion it says is caused by global warming. A pamphlet handed out by Haiti says global warming has worsened hurricanes that hit the island.
"There are definitely signs of trouble emerging around the world," said Dan Esty, a professor of environmental law and policy at Yale and an adviser to President Obama's campaign. "But, with some of these things, it's still hard at this point to say what's exactly climate change and what's natural variability."
Gemenne said that, despite his doubts, Tuvalu still deserves help to protect it from rising seas. "They're certainly one of the most vulnerable," he said.

DOE: Climate change will disrupt energy supply; Power lines less efficient in higher temperatures

U.S. energy supplies will likely face more severe disruptions because of climate change and extreme weather, which have already caused blackouts and lowered production at power plants, a government report warned Thursday.
What's driving these vulnerabilities? Rising temperatures, up 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit in the last century, and the resulting sea level rise, which are accompanied by drought, heat waves, storms and wildfires, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.
"It (climate change) is a very serious problem, and it will get worse," says Jonathan Pershing, who oversaw the report's development. While impacts will vary by region, "no part of the country is immune," he says.
"Sea level rise made Sandy worse," intensifying flooding, Pershing says.  When the superstorm slammed the East Coast last year, it took down power lines, damaged power plants and left millions  in the dark.
The report comes one week after President Obama, describing climate change as a threat to future generations, called for action to address the problem "before it's too late." He said he aims to cut heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions from new and existing power plants.
Echoing other research, the DOE report makes the case for why such reductions are needed. It says coastal power plants are at risk from sea level rise and power lines operate less efficiently in higher temperatures.
"The report accurately outlines the risks to the energy sector"  and should serve as a "wake-up call," says Jennifer Morgan, deputy director of climate and energy at the World Resources Institute, a non-profit that advocates for sustainability.
The report cites prior  disruptions. Last year in Connecticut, the Millstone Nuclear Power Station shut down one reactor because the temperature of water needed to cool the facility -  from the Long Island Sound - was too high. A similar problem caused power reductions in 2010 at  Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Station in New Jersey and  Limerick Generating Station in Pennsylvania.
Reduced snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains last year cut California's hydroelectric power generation by 8%, while drought caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to stop  transporting  oil and coal along the Mississippi River, where water levels were too low. In September 2010, water levels in Nevada's Lake Mead fell to a 54-year low, prompting a 23% loss in the Hoover Dam's generation.
While climate change is not the sole cause of drought,  scientists say rising temperatures can  cause more moisture to evaporate from the soil. They say those temperatures, which the third federal National Climate Assessment says could rise 3 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, will contribute more to drought in the future.
In Texas, which is suffering a three-year drought that now affects 87% of its land, conflicts are arising over the water-intensive process of extracting oil or natural gas from shale deposits, known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. In 2011, Grand Prairie banned city water for fracking. Other municipalities have restricted water use for that purpose.
Nationwide, 47% of fracking wells are in water-stressed areas, says a report  by Ceres, a Boston non-profit.
The DOE report cites research indicating that nearly 60% of current thermoelectric power plants, which need water cooling to operate, are located in water-stressed areas.
It says higher temperatures will boost  demand for air conditioning, which could threaten energy security by forcing the nation's power system to operate beyond ranges for which it was designed. It cites a study by DOE's Argonne National Laboratory that found such peak demand, given current population levels, will require additional electricity equal to 100 new power plants.
The dire tone of the DOE report, while warranted, can "give a reader a sense of fatigue," says Joe Casola, a senior scientist at C2ES, formerly the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. Yet he says it also points to solutions, such as water-efficient technologies and protection for energy infrastructure.
"It's technologically within our means to address some of these issues now," Casola says. "There are a lot of things we can do."
Pershing agrees: "It's a problem we need to work on."  He says  the billions of dollars in losses already incurred from climate-related disasters show the need for additional measures.

We asked what followers thought about President Obama's trip to Alaska to urge a global response to climate change.
It's a wasted trip. There are more important issues he should be addressing.
@tkshemp3
I hope our next president is as committed to the environment. Our lives and livelihoods are at stake!
@RafaAlcalde1
I'm in favor of any solution to climate change that doesn't involve giving money to the government.
@BrooklynCrooner
It's pointless. The  Republicans will oppose anything he does, even if they agree, because it has his stamp.
@Beastwarking
President Obama's trip to Alaska is a waste of time and taxpayer money.
@Evilpa
I commend him for finally taking a step to bring light to this issue in a big way.
@tcahill3391
It's more important than changing the name of Mount McKinley to Denali.
@GHFerdinand

Leave Mount McKinley alone, Mr. President ("Mount McKinley renamed Denali," News, Monday). Tradition and change occur, and honoring a man from Ohio who was president is a wonderful thing! We should honor more public officials and ordinary people in our community.
I grew up knowing the highest mountain in America was Mount McKinley. Will Mount Rushmore be on your hit list, Mr. President? Mount Rushmore was formerly known as the Six Grandfathers by the Sioux.
Nothing is wrong with honoring people of distinction. I happen to like Mount McKinley. Leave it alone.

The trip is designed to use Alaska as a backdrop to continue the propaganda on the climate. It is really about more taxes and bigger government, neither of which will affect the climate.
Boodrow Malone
No issue is more important. We are affecting temperatures, sea levels, ocean acidity and more. Meanwhile, many Republicans deny the reality. They reject what the world's scientific institutions have been saying in favor of corporate fossil fuel interests or a political agenda.

Palin's Alaska makes case on climate change

BARROW, Alaska -- Eight years ago, George W. Bush campaigned on a promise that he would cap carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in a bid to combat global warming. His running mate, Dick Cheney, was not a fan. Soon after coming into office, they ditched the plan.
John McCain has shown far more commitment to confronting climate change than Bush has, but his teaming up with Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who doubts that climate change is man-made, should raise worries that we will see a repeat performance if they are elected. McCain, who conspicuously avoided the words "climate change" and "global warming" when he accepted the Republican nomination, needs to reaffirm in no uncertain terms his commitment to vigorously combat climate change -- and he needs to make his running mate do the same.
Plenty of signs of Arctic ice melt
Palin knows that something is amiss with the climate. In the same interview in which she rejected the scientific consensus on global warming, she noted that "a changing environment will affect Alaska more than any other state." She is undoubtedly right. In travels around the state last month,   we witnessed how Alaska is changing.
In Fairbanks, we met with top polar scientists and discussed the historically low ice coverage in the Arctic. In Barrow, where the Chukchi  and Beaufort seas meet, we observed -- or more precisely did not observe -- this literal sea change, as the ice that had been present off the Arctic shore weeks earlier was long gone. The Arctic's ice is melting much faster than experts predicted. The ice near the North Pole has lost as much as half its thickness in the past seven years alone, and the fabled Arctic passages have just opened together for the first time.
These physical effects are having wide-ranging implications. We spent a week on board the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Spar as it began a voyage from Kodiak Island through the Bering Strait, which separates the U.S. from Russia, to the U.S.-Canada border in the distant Arctic, a mission that no one would have contemplated even a few years ago.  The Spar dropped us in Kivalina, where we visited with tribal leaders and Army engineers. The vanishing ice pack has exposed that small Inupiat community to storm surges that are washing their home away.
Total political support needed for change
These signs are only the beginning -- but they will become far worse if we allow global emissions to grow unchecked. And we will succeed in tackling the problem only if we do it with broad political support. That is why Palin should immediately and explicitly embrace McCain's support for a mandatory cap-and-trade system.
McCain should learn from Palin, too. Alaska has begun a concerted effort to adapt to climate change -- and the U.S. will need to match a comprehensive effort to cut emissions with a national  adaptation strategy. Emphasizing this as they speak, even if it rankles the most hard-line supporters, would be in keeping with their self-styled images as mavericks and reformists.
Or McCain could let Palin slowly but undeniably undercut the growing GOP support, which he has led, for strong action to confront our greenhouse gas emissions. In a  "drill, baby, drill" world, it would be the politically convenient choice. It would also be a shame.
Michael A. Levi is the David M. Rubenstein senior fellow for energy and the environment, and Scott G. Borgerson is visiting fellow for ocean governance, both at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Pope to promote action on climate change; Vatican to issue document to address 'human ecology'

Pope Francis is planning to use one of the highest forms of papal expression -- an encyclical -- to promote action on climate change  to save the planet as a moral and religious imperative.
Vatican officials have outlined what the document will say and are choreographing its release -- as early as June -- for maximum global impact beyond the Catholic Church's 1.2 billion members.
Archbishop Thomas Wenski of Miami, who chairs a panel dealing with environmental issues for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the encyclical has "gone to the translators, so it's at the end of its birthing process."
First on the promotional agenda is an April 28 Vatican conference where United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon will speak. The goal is to advance the morality argument that is a theme of the encyclical.
Then beginning Sept. 23, the pope will visit the White House, address a joint session of Congress -- the first pontiff to do so -- and address the U.N. General Assembly at the beginning of a summit on sustainable development.
"The timing of the encyclical is significant," Cardinal Peter Turkson said  last month. "2015 is a critical year for humanity. ... The coming 10 months are crucial."
The Ghanian cardinal, who  helped draft the encyclical, said all events lead to Paris in December, when nations  gather to debate how to slow global warming. He described the core message  as "human ecology," saying  global economic inequality is inextricably linked to climate change.
The encyclical will urge that saving the environment is saving humanity, particularly the poorest, who are disproportionately impacted by global warming, Turkson said. Francis hopes the document will "shape the discussion in Paris," Wenski said.
Climate change activists are ecstatic. "He, along with the Dali Lama and a few rock stars, are the most popular people on the planet right now," said Mary Evelyn Tucker, director of the Forum on Religion and Ecology at Yale University. "He has moral authority and efficacy."
Skeptics are apprehensive. Francis has fallen into "apocalyptic alarmism," Maureen Mullarkey wrote in the Catholic publication First Things in January. He is "bending theology to premature (and) intemperate policy endorsements."
Climate scientists frustrated that their warnings are not stirring enough public concern  expect the encyclical to get greater attention.  "It has the potential to be seismic," said Thomas Lovejoy, a professor in the environmental science and policy department at George Mason University.
The document will land as a record number of Catholics declare or consider 2016 presidential runs: Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Bobby Jindal, Chris Christie and Rick Santorum, all whom  disagree with Francis' views in part or entirely.
The White House, which supports steps to combat warming, praised Francis' stance. "We welcome the pope's attention and immeasurable influence to this global issue,"  spokesman Frank Benenati said last week.
List
Cuba stop set for September
Pope Francis will visit Cuba before arriving in the United States in September, the Vatican said Wednesday.
The pope is scheduled to visit Washington, New York City and Philadelphia starting  Sept.23.
Francis will be the third pope to visit Cuba, after Pope John Paul II in 1998 and Pope Benedict XVI in 2012. Francis is credited with helping the United States and Cuba reach their agreement to renew diplomatic relations by writing to leaders of both countries.

Climate change debate warms up; Environmental groups ready to capitalize on pope's encyclical, while bishops across U.S. must decide how aggressively they want to push the teachings

Press gaggles, ready-made sermons, tolling church bells, rallies, fasting, vigils and even some gentle nudging of  Congress  are just some of the echoing follow-throughs planned after the release of the pope's climate encyclical Thursday.
"I invite everyone to accept with open hearts this document," Pope Francis told tourists  gathered outside the Vatican on Wednesday. "Our 'house' is being ruined, and that hurts everyone, especially the poorest among us."
But while a core number of American bishops, joined by Catholic environmental and grass-roots groups, will ring in the unveiling with  enthusiasm, it remains to be seen how  those leading the largest single church in the U.S. -- with nearly 72 million Catholics -- will respond.
Two archbishops, including the president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, will offer reaction at a news conference in Washington on Thursday morning. A handful of others will do the same across the country.
But the vast majority of America's 270 Catholic bishops will be left to decide how aggressively to push teachings they received in secret Tuesday, said  Manuel Dorantes, a Vatican spokesman.
"I think once they get the encyclical, they read it and they see what the Holy Father said, there's going to be more bishops on board," he said.
According to a draft  leaked Monday,  Francis states global warming is mostly due to human activity and  burning  fossil fuels.
Already active are the Jesuits, of whom Francis is the first to be elected pope. More than a dozen Jesuit institutions across the country will hold prayer masses  in support of the encyclical.
uphill effort
Catholic Climate Covenant, an environment education and advocacy network, is working with the conference to send out prepared sermons on the pope's climate teachings to encourage delivering  such remarks Sunday, said Dan Misleh, Climate Covenant executive director.
Other initiatives include encouraging bishop-led media events on local climate-change impacts, sending parishes  summaries of the encyclical to slip into church bulletins, designing and distributing interactive video programs and urging the tolling of bells across the nation at noon June28 -- one of the first Sundays after the encyclical's release.
Catholic environmental groups are pushing even harder, organizing congressional district events, particularly for members of Congress who are Catholic, to hand them copies of the document and "really ask them with a very prayerful and open heart to read it," said Patrick Carolan of the Franciscan Action Network.
For many organizers in the U.S., it could be an uphill struggle: A significant percentage of U.S. Catholics don't believe global warming is caused by human activity. Half of Republican Catholics don't believe in global warming at all, and of those who do, only 25% say it is caused by man, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey.
Among Catholic Democrats, 80% believe global warming is real, with six out of 10 saying it is caused by man. Overall, nearly nine out of 10  Catholics view  Francis favorably, placing large numbers of U.S. Catholics at odds with their feelings for the pontiff and his encyclical's conclusions.
building on momentum
U.S.  bishops appointed by Francis' more conservative predecessors, Pope Benedict XVI and Pope John Paul II, constitute much of today's leadership. They've focused on opposing abortion and same-sex marriage.
"I think you will see some bishops who will grab (the climate encyclical) and run with it, be very supportive," said  Thomas Reese, a senior analyst at the Catholic National Reporter. "Other bishops ... they  won't criticize it. They just won't be out there pushing it as hard as other people."
Organizers hope to keep attention  on it through  September, when the pope visits the White House, addresses a joint session of Congress and speaks to the U.N. General Assembly.
"It is stunning," Misleh said. "I have not seen anything like this, and I have worked in the Catholic Church all my life." He concedes some in the U.S. Catholic leadership might be slow to push  it.
"They also have a lot of other concerns," Misleh said.  "So I think it's unrealistic to expect them to drop everything they're doing and just focus on the environment."

Baobabs, Africa's oldest trees, dying; Scientists suspect climate change as killer

Baobab trees -- an icon of the African continent and the heart of many traditional remedies and folklore -- are dying, and scientists are trying to understand why.
A study published Monday found eight of the 13 oldest trees in Africa have died over the past decade, and the authors suggest climate change may affect the ability of the baobab to survive.
"The deaths of the majority of the oldest and largest African baobabs over the past 12 years is an event of an unprecedented magnitude," the study authors said. "These deaths were not caused by an epidemic, and there has also been a rapid increase in the apparently natural deaths of many other mature baobabs."
Baobabs -- also known as "dead-rat" trees because of the shape of their fruit -- are among the world's most distinctive plants, featuring stout, massive, branchless trunks that can look like pillars.
The study's lead author, Adrian Patrut, a chemist at Romania's BabeÈ™-Bolyai University, told NPR that "such a disastrous decline is very unexpected. It's a strange feeling, because these are trees which may live for 2,000 years or more, and we see that they're dying one after another during our lifetime. It's statistically very unlikely."
Using radiocarbon dating, the researchers analyzed more than 60 of the largest and potentially oldest baobab trees in Africa from 2005 to 2017. They were surprised that most of the oldest and biggest died within those 12 years.
Overall, five of the six largest baobabs either died or their oldest parts significantly deteriorated.
Man-made climate change is a likely suspect, scientists said. Increased temperature and drought are the primary threats, Patrut told BBC News. Researchers said further study is necessary to support or refute that idea.
Thomas Lovejoy, an environmental scientist at George Mason University, who was not involved in the study, told The Washington Post that "something obviously is going on in almost selectively affecting the largest and oldest. I do think climate is a likely culprit, but they don't actually present any evidence of how climate is changing where these ancient trees occur."
Whatever the cause, these mysterious deaths will have a big impact on the southern African landscape. In addition to shade, the tree's bark, roots, seeds and fruit are food sources for many animals, according to Science magazine.

Bumblebees stung by climate change

Across Europe and North America, wild bumblebees are vanishing from the southern edges of their territories, according to a new study of 67 species published in this week's issue of the journal Science.
The bees are also passing up the opportunity to venture farther north, where temperatures have risen. As a result, bumblebees -- vital pollinators already struggling to fend off disease and habitat loss -- are being inexorably squeezed into smaller and smaller home ranges.
"These species are at serious and immediate risk of rapid human-induced climate change," University of Ottawa's Jeremy Kerr, the leader of the study, told reporters Wednesday. "This is a huge loss, and it has happened very quickly."
The seemingly fragile butterfly has adapted to warming by flapping northward into previously unexplored territory, and many birds have done the same. So Kerr and his colleagues decided to see whether bumblebees were also rolling with the climate punches. The researchers compiled a database of some half a million bumblebee sightings over more than a century, then compared sightings before and after 1974.
Despite warming of nearly 5 degrees in northern regions, bumblebees failed to push northward into newly toasty areas. Instead they only disappeared from southerly places that became too hot, some retreating nearly 200 miles from what had been their southernmost border.
Bumblebees are being crushed "in a kind of climate vise," Kerr said. "They just aren't colonizing new areas and establishing new populations fast enough to track rapid, human-caused climate change."
It's not clear why the bees don't push northward, but the researchers note that the bees evolved in cool, not tropical, places, so their biochemical machinery may be creaky at sweaty temperatures. The researchers did not find a link between the shrinkage of the bees' sanctuaries and changes in land use. Nor did they link the bees' retreat with pesticide use in the United States.
"Maybe they will move in the future" on their own, Kerr said. But "to date, and despite a lot of warming, it has not happened."

Democrats want US back in Paris deal; Measure is 'only Step 1' in climate change push

WASHINGTON - A day after Senate Republicans short-circuited the Green New Deal, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled a significantly more modest approach Wednesday to addressing climate change: to block the Trump administration from abandoning the international accord known as the Paris Agreement.
Calling climate change "the existential threat of our time," Pelosi described the Climate Action Now Act as "only Step 1" of Democrats' efforts to confront global warming.
The move is far less ambitious than the Green New Deal, the sweeping proposal from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., that calls for shifting completely from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the coming years and prescribes a broad social justice platform that includes free housing, medical coverage and higher education for all Americans.
A number of Democrats, including Pelosi, had signaled for weeks that they weren't ready to get behind such an ambitious plan that had no chance of getting passed in a GOP-controlled Senate or being signed by President Donald Trump.
In unveiling the bill Wednesday, House Democrats tried to reclaim the narrative in Washington after several days of Republican victories, including special counsel Robert Mueller's finding that the Trump campaign did not collude with the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election.
The Democrats'  bill seeks to force the U.S. back into the Paris Agreement, in which nearly 200 countries in 2015 committed to keeping global temperatures no more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Though the accord imposes no penalty for nations that miss the carbon emissions levels they set for themselves, they are required to monitor, report and periodically reassess those targets.
Trump has touted his decision to leave the agreement in 2017 as a move to boost the U.S. economy, especially manufacturing and energy jobs. Democrats, environmental groups and some economists counter that the growth of green jobs would more than make up for jobs lost in the fossil fuel industry.
Also Wednesday, Senate Democrats planned to unveil a Special Committee on Climate Change as a way to keep the  debate alive after  Tuesday's defeat.

A natural fit: Al Gore, Pharrell and 'Live Earth'; Worldwide concerts will rally around climate change

Pharrell Williams and Al Gore are working to stage the next Live Earth event, a global set of concerts that will be broadcast to about 2 billion people this year in an effort to build support for combating climate change.
Williams, a singer/songwriter/producer best known for his hit song Happy, will serve as creative director of the event, which will feature more than 100 artists performing over 24 hours on June 18 at venues around the world.
"We literally are going to have humanity harmonize all at once," he said at Wednesday's announcement at the World Economic Forum.
No details on venues or performers were released Wednesday, although BBC reports that New York has been chosen as the U.S. city to host one of the concerts, along with Paris and cities in Brazil, South Africa, China and Australia. Producers are also working to broadcast the event to countries around the world.
A previous Live Earth event was held in 2007, with concerts on all seven continents, Antarctica included. Artists such as Madonna, Kanye West and Keith Urban performed, but Williams noted that the shows also included "pundits and comedians who didn't understand global warming, and we were often ridiculed. We wanted to do something very different this time."
The main U.S. venue in 2007 was Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. A small "satellite" show featuring Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood was held on the National Mall near the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.
This year's Live Earth is an attempt to galvanize interest the topic of global warming ahead of key climate change talks in Paris in December.
Former vice president Gore, who won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his work on raising awarness of climate change, including his production of the documentary An Inconvenient Truth, said it is "absolutely critical" that the world build momentum going into United Nations-brokered negotiations in Paris.
On the sidelines of Wednesday's announcement, USA TODAY asked Gore what is needed to sustain public interest in a topic that routinely flits in and out of the news and still regularly divides many worldwide.
"Mother Nature has the most persuasive voice," he said. "Climate-related extreme weather events have really changed thinking dramatically."
In a 30-minute presentation in which he reminded the audience that 2014 was the hottest year on record, Gore showed a series of dramatic slides that linked many of the world's extreme conflicts and trouble spots -- from Syria to China -- to a warming planet whose infrastructure is being "radically changed."
"Man-made global warming pollution already in the planet's atmosphere traps as much extra heat energy every day as would be released by 400,000 Hiroshima-class atomic weapons," Gore said.

All eyes on Calif. climate-change fight; Proposed measures would set law in motion to battle global warming

SAN FRANCISCO -- Make big-rig trucks more aerodynamic. Allow docked ships to shut off engines and plug into electrical outlets. Require oil-change technicians to check tire pressure.
Those measures and six more that California regulators will consider this month are among early actions in what will be a long, fiercely debated and politically perilous battle against global warming.
Sleeker trucks, ships that don't idle in port and proper tire inflation don't seem earthshaking, but each would be a small step toward reaching California's ambitious goal -- spelled out in its landmark 2006 law -- of producing fewer greenhouse gases, which most scientists believe cause the planet to warm.
California, whose economy is larger than Canada's, is the only state that has ordered mandatory cuts in greenhouse gases. With no federal action yet on climate change, the process here is being closely watched across the country and worldwide.
California will pioneer many solutions to cutting greenhouse gases, says James Sweeney, director of Stanford University's Precourt Institute for Energy Efficiency. "The significance of what California is doing is we're helping the whole United States at least figure out how to move forward," he says.
Even here, climate change can be divisive. A bill to push cities and counties to plan development that encourages less driving passed the California Senate this year but stalled in the Assembly.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Legislature disagree on how to solve expected water shortages caused by global warming. The governor wants to spend billions of dollars on new dams to store water, but the Legislature is urging less energy-intensive measures.
Working out the details
Carrying out California's climate-change law is the Air Resources Board (ARB), a powerful agency that approved the nation's first motor vehicle emission standards in the 1960s and was the first to phase out lead in gasoline.
The law says California must slash greenhouse gases 25% by 2020. This month's nine proposed rules, plus three others approved in June, could achieve 10% of the target, the ARB says.
Working out specifics and putting into effect rules that include requiring cleaner fuels, landfills and auto air conditioners will take more than a year.
And that's just the start.
The ARB won't finish a detailed plan of how the 2020 goal is to be achieved until the end of next year. Then the stage will be set for what are likely to be the most fought-over rules aimed at power plants, cement manufacturers, refineries and other big producers of greenhouse gases.
"The board's been criticized for not acting fast enough, but I'd rather see quality than speed," Sweeney says. "To do this poorly would signal to the rest of the nation that you can't do it right. That would harm the movement forward."
Industries that will bear costs of cutting greenhouse gases likely will try to water down the regulations, fearing a competitive disadvantage to out-of-state companies.
"I think industry will start dragging its feet more and more as these rules get closer to reality," says Bill Magavern, senior representative for Sierra Club California.
The California Chamber of Commerce lobbied against the law last year but now is committed to the 2020 goal as long as the state's economy stays healthy, Vice President Dominic DiMare says.
"Right now, we don't oppose any of the proposals out there," he says. "That could change."
Political debate has scarcely begun on how to design another potentially large long-term emissions savings: a carbon tax or market-based "cap and trade" system.
Carbon dioxide and other carbon-based gases are the leading causes of greenhouse gases. Under cap and trade, the ARB would set emissions limits, or caps, and allow companies who can't meet them to buy credits from those that can. The cap would gradually be lowered to force greater and greater emissions reductions.
California's climate-change initiatives go beyond the state law and are already being felt nationally. Two years ago, the ARB ordered cuts in auto emissions, source of 40% of greenhouse gases. The state sought permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to enforce its stricter state rule. Thirteen other states have passed similar measures.
The EPA hasn't ruled on the ARB's request, even though the Supreme Court said in April that the agency has the power to regulate greenhouse gases as air pollutants.
Options not always black and white
In the legislative battle over the state law, supporters argued that a crackdown on greenhouse gases would stimulate new technologies and make California a global center of clean, efficient energy.
"We think they overstated the virtues of climate-change regulation and the business that would follow it," DiMare says. "It wasn't supported by strong evidence."
Others disagree. "The more we get serious about this, the more we'll start to build better technologies and then start selling them," says Dan Kammen, a University of California, Berkeley energy professor. "There's a huge global market now for clean technology."
So far, the ARB has plucked "low-hanging fruit," ARB spokesman Leo Kay says, a reference to measures seen as less burdensome and costly than those to come later. Affected industries beg to differ.
Complying with the cleaner-fuel standard will be tough for the oil and refining sector, says Cathy Reheis-Boyd, a Western States Petroleum Association executive. Solutions that have gotten a lot of attention, such as blending corn-based ethanol with gasoline, may not pass ARB muster, she says.
The ARB will require accounting for greenhouse gases from a fuel's entire "life cycle": emissions from fertilizer in the cornfield, the tractor harvesting the corn and transportation to a refinery.
"It's not as simple as everything with a 'B' in front of it for biodiesel is good, and everything with an 'E' in front of it for ethanol is good," Reheis-Boyd says. "You could choose something that makes climate change worse if you're not careful."

Climate change factors into land buys; Conservationists see future shifts in areas needing preservation

Climate change is prompting some conservation groups to broaden strategies in buying pristine lands, recognizing that some may be under water in 50 years or undergo other drastic changes.
For the first time, land trusts and other conservationists are factoring in evidence that global warming is altering the migration of species, reconfiguring coastlines and transforming natural habitats.
"Natural habitat in one place now might move 100 miles in 50 years because of climate change," says Matt Shaffer of the Trust for Public Land. "It's hard to pinpoint where that migration is going to happen."
Among the changes:
*The Nature Conservancy is targeting acres that are inland now but will quite likely be near the shoreline as coastal erosion worsens.
In the Albemarle Peninsula near North Carolina's Outer Banks, sea levels have been rising 2 inches every decade. Up to 469,000 acres of low-lying land could be flooded by as little as a 12-inch increase, the Nature Conservancy says. The group is restoring oyster reefs and identifying trees tolerant of salt in the soil in preparation for stronger waves that cause erosion.
"If you look at any one specific place, it's very difficult to predict how much warmer it will get, how much wetter, how much drier," says Bill Stanley, who directs the Conservancy's Global Climate Change Initiative.
*Conservation groups are protecting land on a much larger scale than previously because they say hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters are becoming more frequent and severe. In the Northeast, the Nature Conservancy is setting aside forestland at least 25,000 acres at a time. In the 1990s, it was making acquisitions of 1,000 to 2,000 acres, says Mark Anderson, director of conservation science for the eastern region.
"Some places are going up to 100,000 acres," he says. Massive forest acreage can offset tree losses in areas hit by disasters.
*The Minnesota Land Trust is connecting small parcels of protected land to form long corridors that can accommodate animal species and vegetation through various stages of climate change.
"All of us looking at conservation projects are thinking not so much anymore about what's on the ground today, but what's in the future," President Jane Prohaska says.
*The Nature Conservancy is using ClimateWizard, a computer program that can show how temperatures have changed over the past 100 years and how they're likely to change in the future. It is also updating its strategies to preserve ecosystems in the face of development, agricultural runoff, roads and overfishing.
"In the past, (we) never took climate change into account," says Jeff DeBlieu of the group's Climate Change Learning Network. "Now, we're trying to get much more exact with reduced precipitation, increased temperatures."
It's unlikely that groups will steer away from purchases.
"We've certainly not come to the conclusion that we should abandon coastal areas," says Bob Stokes, president of the Galveston Bay Foundation, in a Texas area hard hit by Hurricane Ike. "However, we are going into it with our eyes wide open."

Scientists believe that birds in North America are getting smaller because of rising temperatures associated with climate change.
A study published Wednesday in the peer-reviewed Ecology Letters found not only that birds' bodies are shrinking, but also that their legs are getting shorter and wings are getting longer.
David Willard, study co-author and collections manager emeritus at the Field Museum in Chicago, measured 70,716 North American migratory birds of 52 different species from 1978 to 2016.
For nearly 40 years, scientists and researchers woke up at about 3:30 a.m. to collect and measure birds that crashed into the museum's windows during the spring or fall migration period for Willard, according to the Field Museum.
"It started as a very casual study - someone mentioned that birds sometimes run into McCormick Place, and I was curious, so I went for a walk around the building one morning," Willard said in the museum's press release. "I found a couple dead birds and I brought them back to the museum."
Willard discovered that over time the birds' mass decreased by about 2.6% and leg length decreased by about 2.4%. He also found that their wing length increased by about 1.3%.
Scientists also measured temperature, precipitation, vegetation and other environmental factors. They found that warmer temperatures were associated with a smaller body size.
Co-author Benjamin Winger, who also studies the evolution and ecology of birds at  University of Michigan, told The Washington Post that warmer temperatures have had an "almost universal effect" of shrinking other animals.
According to the Field Museum, smaller bodies hold onto less heat and larger bodies hold onto more. The phenomenon is called Bergmann's rule, and it helps animals stay  comfortable  in different environments.
"We had good reason to expect that increasing temperatures would lead to reductions in body size, based on previous studies," said the study's lead author, Brian Weeks,  assistant professor at  University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability. "The thing that was shocking was how consistent it was. I was incredibly surprised that all of these species are responding in such similar ways."
The findings were consistent with a 2017 study that researched the breeding of wild zebra finches across a range of temperatures. Scientists found that a hotter climate during breeding periods produced smaller birds.
Authors of the most recent study, however, also noted that other complications of climate change, such as food limitation, could have something to do with body size reduction.

Fears of climate change spark action in N.H.; Warmer weather's potential effect on economy prompts city to boost efforts at conservation

KEENE, N.H. -- This city is preparing for the worst.
Climate change is inevitable, not theoretical, many city leaders here agree. They're trying to anticipate how higher temperatures, less snow and more rain will affect every aspect of life here -- and what changes they must make to protect the city, its 23,000 residents and its 6,000 college students.
The possibilities are daunting: Where will residents work if the sugar maple, skiing and tourism industries disappear because of warmer weather? What if increasingly intense spring and fall storms overwhelm the city's culverts and wastewater treatment plant? What if hotter days fuel the growth of algae that harms water quality? What if roofs collapse under the weight of heavy snow and ice? What if severe weather cuts off transportation routes?
"The sky may not be falling today, but the signs are all around us that these kinds of things can happen," City Manager John MacLean says. "We have to plan for them."
The harbingers of climate change trouble residents of this picturesque city in a glacial lakebed that's surrounded by ridges and was settled in 1735. Its vivid autumn leaves, pumpkin festival, skiing and snowboarding are a source of pride and attract tourists.
Already, though, some sugar maples are dying as the climate grows warmer. A catastrophic flood in 2005 was followed by a series of spring and fall storms that some here worry marks a permanent shift in weather patterns.
Those changes conjure images of an ominous future for Mikaela Engert, a city planner here. "If we lose our maples, part of our cultural identification and heritage would be missing," she says. "Maybe we won't have as much of a winter; that could have an impact on our economy. We could see smog. It could be a hotter, drier environment and wetter at certain times of the year."
A template for other cities?
For years, Keene has tried to prevent that from happening by reducing emissions and conserving energy. Firetrucks, snowplows and other city vehicles run on biodiesel fuel. Methane gas at the municipal landfill is converted into electricity. Streetlights use energy-efficient LED bulbs. Three traffic roundabouts keep vehicles moving, minimizing emissions from idling cars.
In 2006, Keene was recruited by Local Governments for Sustainability, an international association, to be a test case for what's being called adaptation planning: anticipating the ways climate change could affect every facet of a community and shifting government resources now to prepare. Keene's experience, the group hopes, will serve as a template for other cities. A committee of city officials and representatives from Antioch University New England and Keene State College tackled that long list of "what-ifs."
The committee decided to focus on the issues city government deals with every day, says Chairman Jim Duffy, a member of the City Council. "We identified any function of the city -- from emergency response to building codes to ordinances -- that would be affected," he says. The panel brainstormed what might happen, what the city could do and came up with goals and target dates for meeting them.
"We were forced to connect the dots," Duffy says. "Climate change isn't just about the natural environment; it affects everything we do."
Jaycee Clark, co-owner of Norm's Ski & Bike Shop, which sells skiing and snowboarding gear, has already noticed changes in the winters. Snow used to arrive earlier, he says, and there was more of it. He supports the city's focus on preparedness. "It's time to think about it -- before it's too late," he says.
Cost is a concern
In a November report the committee proposed dozens of goals, big and small: changing design standards to encourage more pitched roofs; identifying alternate transportation routes; building bigger culverts; increasing water storage capacity in case of drought; developing a food security plan; providing public education about disease protection.
The next steps are to start thinking about ways to pay for the changes in a city with a $51 million budget and keep the momentum going, Mayor Dale Pregent says.
"You can't just say, 'Let's do these 10 things now and it's going to cost $10 million,'" he says. "You have to do it as cheaply as possible so you don't have a big tax impact, because you'll scare people and they won't want to do it."
Instead, says former mayor Mike Blastos, adapting to climate change has to be the foundation of every decision. "You incorporate into planning and keep it in the forefront of everything you do," he says. A proposed ordinance that would regulate new construction on hillsides to limit damage from runoff from wetter weather will be an early test of the city's commitment to change.
Kay Delanoy, a retiree who was on the committee, sees no choice but to start preparing. "We know what's coming," she says. "It just makes common sense to plan for it, and towns that don't plan are going to be in a bad way."
Duffy, though, worries about sustaining that sense of urgency. "It would be great if global warming had the face of Osama bin Laden," he says, "but it's this abstract, overwhelming thing and you don't see the impacts that clearly yet."

Demystifying climate change; In report, scientists answer some of the top questions

Climate change is often called a "defining" issue of our time but  can be difficult to understand. On Thursday, two of the world's leading scientific groups released a reader-friendly guide.
This primer explains why, despite a cold winter in parts of the United States, scientists are so sure that man-made global warming is worsening, and how that's melting Arctic sea ice, raising sea levels and acidifying the oceans.
"There will always be cold nights and cold days ... but they'll become rarer," co-author Inez Fung of the University of California-Berkeley said at a Washington, D.C., forum. She also said a warmer, moister atmosphere provides more energy for storms and severe weather events.
"Actions today have long-term consequences," Fung said. Even if heat-trapping carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels  suddenly stop, she said it will take thousands of years for the Earth to cool to pre-industrial levels.
Co-author Eric Wolff of the University of Cambridge said the planet's climate has changed throughout history, but now it's changing 10 times faster, making adaptation more challenging. He said most of the warming (1.4 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1900 has occurred since the mid-1970s.
Climate Change: Evidence and Causes  is written by a dozen climate scientists on behalf of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, a private independent group, and the Royal Society, the national scientific academy of the United Kingdom. It explains what scientists know and what they're still learning.
The authors say carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations are now higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years, and unless carbon emissions are curbed, the planet could warm 4.7 to 8.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100. They answer 20 key questions, some of  which are excerpted below:
How do scientists know that recent climate change is largely caused by human activities? Direct measurements of CO2 in the atmosphere and in air trapped in ice show that atmospheric CO2 increased by about 40% from 1800 to 2012. Measurements of different forms of carbon reveal that this increase is because of human activities.
Does the recent slowdown of warming mean that climate change is no longer happening? No. Since the very warm year 1998 that followed the strong 1997-98 El Niño,  the increase in average surface temperature has slowed relative to the previous decade. Despite that,  the 2000s were warmer than the 1990s. A short-term slowdown in the warming of Earth's surface does not invalidate our understanding of long-term changes in global temperature.
If the world is warming, why are some winters and summers still very cold? Global warming is a long-term trend, but that does not mean that every year will be warmer than the previous one. Day-to-day and year-to-year changes in weather patterns will continue to produce some unusually cold days and nights, and winters and summers, even as the climate warms.
Why is Arctic sea ice decreasing while Antarctic sea ice is not? Sea ice extent is affected by winds and ocean currents as well as temperature. Sea ice in the partly enclosed Arctic Ocean seems to be responding directly to warming, while changes in winds and in the ocean seem to be dominating the patterns of climate and sea ice change in the ocean around Antarctica.

Change shadows Rocky Mountain National Park; Officials battle climate change, beetles and time

ESTES PARK, Colo. -- John Mack hopped out of his government-issue Ford Escape one recent November day and confirmed that a lone wind-toppled tree between campsites at Glacier Basin Campground at Rocky Mountain National Park was a lodgepole pine killed by pine beetles.
Mack, natural resources branch chief at Rocky Mountain National Park, pointed to pockets of dead trees amid the lush green lodgepoles uphill of the campground.
The pine beetles, he said, are now eating their way into forests on the east side of the park after laying waste to forests on its west side.
Just over five years before its 2015 centennial, Rocky Mountain National Park -- nicknamed "Rocky" among park staff -- is in a state of flux as climate change bears down on it, deferred maintenance projects rack up a price tag greater than $50 million in the down economy, and industry-tainted air quality becomes a primary concern among park biologists.
The chemical composition of both tundra soil and mountain lake water is becoming more toxic for plants and animals because agricultural and industrial pollution deposit nitrogen in sensitive areas, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.
Populations of pika -- tiny rabbitlike mammals -- are disappearing in the park's newly designated wilderness.
Challenges and hopes
Glacier Basin Campground is the postcard example of the challenges and the hopes for Rocky Mountain National Park.
Closed since 2008, the campground has seen half of its trees -- many killed by the pine beetle -- shorn to the ground. Once-sheltered campsites are exposed to sunlight and sweeping views of Trail Ridge and snow-clad peaks.
The other half of the campground remains shaded under a dense stand of young healthy looking lodgepoles, each one sprayed with a chemical to keep the pine beetle at bay.
There has been no lack of road construction projects at the park in recent years, each one taking a chunk out of the park's more than $80 million worth of deferred maintenance projects, park superintendent Vaughn Baker said.
Once the road projects are complete, about $50 million in maintenance projects will remain, Baker said.
Each year Rocky Mountain National Park receives $6 million to $8 million in congressional appropriations and entrance fees designated specifically for maintenance projects, Baker said. If that level of funding continues, the backlog of maintenance on more than 800 buildings, trails and campgrounds will take about a decade.
"We've got a ways to go," Baker said.
There's a lot to do: Trails that have hardly been touched in 75 years need to be reconstructed to allow for proper drainage and prevent erosion. Historic buildings need to be maintained, and old sewer lines must be replaced.
The park also is considering the potential for a surge in visitors over the next two decades, when an additional 2 million people are projected to visit annually, Baker said.
"At what point do you say enough is enough?" he said. "In some areas (other parks) have limited access to a particular part of the park because of the fragility of the resources. We haven't come to that here yet. We haven't established a threshold."
Though the crowds visiting Rocky Mountain National Park's 265,000 acres peaked in 1999 when 3.18 million people visited, the number has hovered from 2.7 million to 3 million for years, according to Park Service statistics.
Environmental issues
The wild backcountry many come to explore at the park may be changing as rapidly as the bark beetle is spreading.
Of the five populations of pika known in the park, two low-elevation populations disappeared this year, said Ben Bobowski, the park's chief of resource stewardship.
The health of pikas in Colorado has long been known as a possible indicator of the impact of climate change, but it's premature to say whether climate change is behind the pika's disappearance, he said.
"It's difficult to say it's a cause and effect," he said. "But it certainly seems that it's one indicator of change."
Park biologists' observations next summer will provide more clues, he said.
The park is also battling many unknowns, such as the future of the park's glaciers, Bobowski said.
Unlike other mountain parks across the West, Rocky Mountain National Park's glaciers aren't rapidly melting -- yet. Many are tucked away in shady nooks where sub-freezing temperatures most of the year keep them from dripping away.
"We haven't seen anything dramatic as of yet attributed to climate change," Bobowski said. But, "we're preparing for them to retreat."

Study warns of bee species extinctions; Climate change behind die-offs, scientists say

Climate change contributed to drastic declines in the population and diversity of bumblebees across North America and Europe, according to a long-term study of more than 60 bee species in the journal Science.
Researchers discovered bumblebees are disappearing at rates "consistent with a mass extinction."
The scientists said North America's bumblebee populations fell by 46% during the two time periods the study used - from 1901 to 1974 and from 2000 to 2014.
Bee populations were hardest hit in warming southern regions such as Mexico, because of more frequent extreme warm years, which exceeded the species' historical temperature ranges, according to the study.
"If declines continue at this pace, many of these species could vanish forever within a few decades," study lead author Peter Soroye, a Ph.D. student at the University of Ottawa, said in a statement.
"We've known for a while that climate change is related to the growing extinction risk that animals are facing around the world. In this paper, we offer an answer to the critical questions of how and why that is," Soroye said. "We find that (bee) species extinctions across two continents are caused by hotter and more frequent extremes in temperatures."
The study found that in the course of a single human generation, the likelihood of a bumblebee population surviving in a given place has declined by an average of more than 30%.
Bumblebees are the best pollinators in wild landscapes and the most effective pollinators for important crops such as tomato, squash and berries, Soroye said. "Our results show that we face a future with many less bumblebees and much less diversity, both in the outdoors and on our plates."
In an accompanying perspective article in Science, Jonathan Bridle and Alexandra van Rensburg of the University of Bristol wrote, "The new study adds to a growing body of evidence for alarming, widespread losses of biodiversity and for rates of global change that now exceed the critical limits of ecosystem resilience."
Soroye concluded, "We have now entered the world's sixth mass extinction event, the biggest and most rapid global biodiversity crisis since a meteor ended the age of the dinosaurs."

Sea changes come to sports; Climate change heats up debate about ocean warming, effects on recreational life

If you are among  the estimated 86 million people who will visit a U.S. beach this summer, the impact of climate change on sports and recreation is becoming very apparent.
Hurricanes are increasing in number and strength, beach erosion is wiping out dunes and waves are becoming too big for surfing and sport fishing, some climate experts say.
Higher ocean water temperatures are causing coral bleaching and the death of reefs that are the homes of many living creatures as well as popular sites for divers.
For oceans activist David Helvarg, the time for alarm has come.
"The (hurricane) destruction in 2004 and 2005 was no exception," says Helvarg, who heads the Blue Frontier Campaign and recently authored the book Fifty Ways to Save the Ocean. "We need to change Earth Day into Ocean Day. About 95% of the planet's living creatures are in the water. The rising temperatures in our seas can have major consequences for all of us."
As ocean temperatures change, Helvarg says, extreme weather events proliferate. That puts much of the nation's prime recreational real estate -- everything from the famous and picturesque greens at Pebble Beach in California to the "pipeline" surfing waves at Oahu's North Shore -- in danger.
The global implications for life -- and sport -- beyond the beach are just as serious.
Thailand's Phi Phi Island is literally on the other side of the world from the USA's Eastern Seaboard, but the interconnectivity of the planet's weather systems and the effects of climate change link North Carolina's Outer Banks surfers to local diving leader Prem Tinsulanonda.
Prem's  dive boat takes customers to some of the world's most beautiful undersea attractions, most near the bigger and better-known island of Phuket in the Malacca Strait.
Phuket and many of the nearby islands were hit hard by the Dec.26, 2004, tsunami, which killed more than 4,000 locals and tourists.
"The tsunami was a wake-up call for many of us," Prem says. "We came to understand how fragile our ocean can be.
"Things that happen far away can make a big change on us because we are all connected by the water. How we treat the sea is not just a Phi Phi problem but one for the world, because something bad in one area can quickly become a tragedy in another, even on the other side of the world."
Around-the-world sailor Sebastien Josse has seen almost all of the planet's oceans from behind the wheel of a sailboat.
From his current perspective as skipper of ABN Amro Two in the nearly completed Volvo Ocean Challenge, Josse says, "It is the health of the sea that determines the well-being of the land. Man has created the means to damage the sea, so man must make it right."
Cause and effect
The United Nations' International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that global temperatures will rise 2.5-10 degrees by 2100. The National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., projects an average 5-degree increase by the end of the century.
The IPCC estimates  rainfall will increase up to 20% in wet regions, causing floods, while decreasing 20% in arid areas, causing droughts. The Environmental Protection Agency says melting glaciers and warmer ocean waters probably will cause an average 2-foot rise in sea level on all U.S. coasts by 2100.
Most experts now agree  the cause is too much "greenhouse gases" -- mostly carbon dioxide -- in the atmosphere, which trap solar heat the same way greenhouse windows keep heat indoors.
Some scientists, including Helvarg, believe this heating has led to bigger and stronger storms.
The 2006 hurricane season officially begins Thursday, and the early forecast from  William M. Gray of Colorado State University's Department of Atmospheric Science is for 17 named storms that will result in nine full-blown hurricanes. That's down from 2005's record of destruction wrought from 28 named storms, 15 of which became hurricanes.
But surfers, anglers and sailors whose lives and livelihoods depend on accurate forecasting know the delicate and complicated factors that go into storm formation.
The interaction between weather systems is mind-boggling. The hurricanes that rock the Southeast U.S. and Gulf areas are spawned by multiple  variables that range from the fickle African Easterly Jet that forms off the western coast of Africa to the Saharan Air Layer, a dusty air mass that sometimes leaves a film of desert dust on cars in Miami and is believed to slow the growth of tropical storms.
But even those forces are influenced by the powerful hot-water El Nioo and cold-water La Nioa in the tropical Pacific as well as a subtropical high pressure system that has been parked  just off North America for the last two years and has been blamed by some climatologists for steering storms into the East Coast instead of moving into the Atlantic. The forces are complex, but the result is clear.
"We are already seeing the effects," Helvarg says. "2005 was the hottest year ever, turning our oceans into a hot pool of water. Even with the modest expectation of a 2-foot rise in sea levels, a lot of coastal areas will become even more dangerous."
He sees a bleak future where many beachside communities will have to pull back, some as far as 40 miles, to avoid the wrath of super storms.
"In the 1980s, 17 of the nation's fastest growing counties were coastal. One in four homes with FEMA flood insurance are within 500 feet of the water. Think of what that could do to the businesses that depend on ocean access. Sport fishing could be decimated in many areas."
Not all scientists agree with Helvarg's dark projections.
Robert C. Balling Jr., director of the Office of Climatology and a professor of geography at Arizona State University, says while it is true that sea levels are rising, it is a process that has been "going on for the last 8,000 years" at a consistent increase of only 1.8millimeters a year.
"There's no evidence of an acceleration of that rate, and to blame it on global warming is quite a stretch," Balling says. "The Earth cooled from 1940 to 1980, yet sea levels continued to rise at that rate."
Balling, co-author of the 2000 book The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming, concurs that it is the nature of the planet's oceans to be influenced by atmospheric conditions in other parts of the world.
"A huge event in one area will certainly have an effect in the others," he says. "But there is no evidence that events such as Hurricane Katrina are the result of global warming. Yes, eventually recreation and sports will be affected by rising sea levels, but that will take hundreds of years. There is a visible increase in damage to recreation areas simply because there are more people recreating, just as there is more damage to property because people are building closer to the water than ever before."
Changing behavior
The vast majority of greenhouse gases come from industrial sources. The booming economies of China and India -- which, along with the USA, have not ratified the Kyoto Protocols on reducing emissions -- will not be throttled back anytime soon.
"We know the solution," Helvarg says. "We need a transition from carbon fuels.
"One hundred and fifty years ago, we were dependent on whale oil. Entire industries and communities were based on it. Then we made the transition to rock oil. We survived that, and we will survive the next transition. But first it has to start in your heart."
Or because of your heart.
"It's hard to realize the need for change inside an air-conditioned box on wheels, but the transition away from the automobile-centric lifestyle is inevitable," says Michael Browne, editor of Dirt Rag, a magazine that examines cycling culture.
"But the answer is probably hanging in your garage. So start riding your mountain bike now -- your health and that of future generations depends on it."

LETTERS
President Obama last week rejected the Keystone pipeline extension. He justifies his action by saying that it has become too political and that he is trying to mitigate climate change ("Obama administration rejects Keystone pipeline," USATODAY.com, Friday).
However, there is nothing particularly political about the Keystone decision except  Obama's desire to cater to environmentalists. And transportation of oil by an extension of the Keystone pipeline is more environmentally friendly than transportation of the same oil by rail or by tanker trucks. One other shortcoming of this decision is Obama's consistent failure to describe how this decision will in fact  limit or slow down climate change.
The American people deserve more facts and less presidential fantasy.
James F. Blackstock
Brentwood, Tenn.
The long battle over the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline came down to a central question: Is it in our national interest? It never was, and President Obama was right to reject it.
The pipeline project would have piped some of the dirtiest oil on the planet through the breadbasket of America to be refined on the Gulf Coast, mostly into fuels then shipped overseas. It always was a plan about big profits for big oil, not about helping our country. The State Department's own analysis determined that -- from wellhead to wheels -- tar sands fuel generates 17% more carbon pollution than conventional oil. That's 17% more -- gallon per gallon -- of the dangerous carbon pollution that's driving climate change.
Anchoring us to fossil fuels of the past for another 50 years is not where our country needs to go. We're already finding cleaner, safer and more efficient ways to power our economy. We're building more fuel-efficient cars, all-electric and hybrid vehicles, powering them more and more with electricity from the wind and sun.  Obama stood up to protect us from climate change and accelerate the transition to clean energy. That's the kind of leadership we expect of our presidents.

We asked what our followers thought about the Obama administration rejecting the Keystone pipeline.
This decision makes no sense at all. The oil is just going to be shipped by other, more dangerous, means.
@msmith586777
Thank you, President Obama, for saving the planet from greedy, selfish oil companies that only care about money.
@HenrettaIndia
More oil shipped by rail will mean higher prices for consumers and no change in the flow of oil.
@tomtabsand
Just because oil prices appear lower during his presidency doesn't mean we shouldn't be proactive!

Website puts target on climate change in Arctic; Time seems right to tackle this topic in an immersive style

I guess Lara Setrakian was serious.
Setrakian is the poet laureate of the deeply immersive, single-topic website perhaps best illustrated by her acclaimed Syria Deeply, which she launched three years ago. In March 2014, she told me that her second site would be Arctic Deeply, focusing on the melting polar ice caps and set to debut that summer.
Then the Ebola crisis erupted, followed by the California drought, and they became the topics for Deeplies No.2 and No.3.
Now, at last, Arctic Deeply  will debut Dec. 8, and Setrakian says she is "extremely excited."
The venture is a partnership with the Centre for International Governance Innovation, a Canadian think-tank.
"The Arctic has been a huge priority for us for quite a while," says Setrakian, a former correspondent for ABC News and Bloomberg TV.
The timing seems right: The United States chairs the Arctic Council, and the temperature in the Arctic is rising at twice the rate as in the rest of the world.
The Deeplies are designed to address an all-too-familiar phenomenon in the news business.
When a story explodes, there is saturation coverage. Then something else explodes, and the parade moves on, and the aftermath of Explosion No. 1 is too often ignored. That's what inspired Setrakian, a former Middle East correspondent, to create Syria Deeply, which was widely applauded from the start.
On its first day, Fast Company proclaimed, "SYRIA DEEPLY OUTSMARTS THE NEWS, REDEFINES CONFLICT COVERAGE."
Setrakian says there are many other subjects that have a "Syria problem."
Setrakian looks for topics that are "generally underreported and extremely consequential for our time."
Setrakian says the episodic approach "is how our industry is built. You can't cover everything at the same time." That said, "there are people who want to know what happens on Day Four. We're here to fill in the gaps."
Arctic Deeply will follow the model of its three predecessors.
It will offer a mix of original content, links to top-flight coverage from other news outlets, news summaries, maps, op-eds, backgrounders, timelines, data visualization, you name it. All on the Arctic.
Providing that original content will be Managing Editor Hannah Hoag, who has written about climate change for a variety of publications for more than a decade. Setrakian describes Hoag's role as "hyperactive beat reporter."
For Hoag, the mission is personal.
She has visited the Arctic, and she has witnessed the impact of climate change on the population, the rising sea levels and "villages falling into the ocean."
"I've seen the changes firsthand," Hoag says.
Though  she will be based in Toronto, Hoag plans to make frequent trips to the Arctic.
Hoag says she was attracted to Arctic Deeply because "it checked a lot of boxes for me."
She says that she sees the new gig as an opportunity to take her climate change reporting to a, yes, deeper level.
"I want to talk to the people affected by climate change," Hoag says. "It's a chance to focus on a niche issue that's really important now and in the future."
Setrakian says that, three years in, she's more convinced than ever that her approach works.
"We have fantastic engagement metrics," she says. "There has been a lot of validation of the single-topic model."
Though News Deeply has gotten some grants, it supports itself in part by building platforms for other companies.
It has eight full-time employees devoted to all of the sites, including copy editors and digital staffers, and eight employees for specific projects.
Though traffic spikes at times of crisis, Setrakian says, the sites maintain a devoted cadre of regular visitors.
"For the diehards, there is a home," she says.
Should we look for more Deeplies in the future?
Setrakian says, "Refugees Deeply is definitely on the agenda."

'Bird emergency': Two-thirds at risk; Climate change threatens almost 400 species in US

Two-thirds of America's birds will be threatened with extinction if global warming tops 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, according to a report released Thursday by the National Audubon Society.
"A lot of people paid attention to last month's report that North America has lost nearly a third of its birds," said David Yarnold, CEO and president of Audubon. "This new data pivots forward and imagines an even more frightening future. It's a bird emergency."
Three hundred eighty-nine out of 604 species are at risk of extinction from climate change, the report said. A few of the imperiled species include state birds such as Minnesota's common loon, New Jersey's goldfinch and California's quail.
To prepare the report - "Survival by Degrees: Bird Species on the Brink" - Audubon scientists studied 604 North American bird species using 140 million bird records, including observational data from bird lovers and field biologists across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
In addition to warming temperatures, the scientists also looked at climate-related effects  on birds across the lower 48 states, including sea-level rise, water level changes in the Great Lakes, urbanization, cropland expansion, droughts, extreme spring heat, fire weather and heavy rain.
"Birds are important indicator species because if an ecosystem is broken for birds, it is or soon will be for people, too," said Brooke Bateman, Audubon's senior climate scientist.
The report offered some hope, noting that if the greenhouse gas emissions that bring about climate change are reduced, then the odds of survival for many bird species can be lifted.
David O'Neill, Audubon's chief conservation officer, called the findings  "the fifth alarm in a five-alarm fire."

Peabody reaches climate-change deal; Coal giant agrees to disclose financial risks to investors

The world's largest publicly-traded coal company has agreed to make fuller public disclosures about the risks climate change poses to its business in a settlement of charges that it misled investors and the public.
Peabody Energy reached the settlement after a two-year investigation found the St. Louis-based company's public statements about the potential economic impact of climate change didn't always square with the firm's internal financial projections, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Monday.
Peabody shares closed up 3.43% at $15.09. The coal giant's stock has lost more than 87% of its value since a Feb. 25 high of $118.95-a-share amid a global plunge in energy prices. The agreement comes four days after Schneiderman opened a similar investigation of Exxon Mobil.
Peabody has agreed to file revised Securities and Exchange Commission disclosures affirming that "concerns about the environmental impacts of coal combustion ... could significantly affect demand for our products or our securities," said Schneiderman, who characterized the agreement as the first of its kind.
"As a publicly traded company whose core business generates massive amounts of carbon emissions, Peabody Energy has a responsibility to be honest with its investors and the public about the risks posed by climate change, now and in the future," Schneiderman said in a statement announcing the agreement. "I believe that full and fair disclosures by Peabody and other fossil fuel companies will lead investors to think long and hard about the damage these companies are doing to our planet."
The coal giant in a statement stressed that "there is no other action associated with this settlement, no admission or denial of wrongdoing and no financial penalty." Peabody also said "the company has always sought to make appropriate disclosures."
However, Peabody's past SEC filings regularly denied the company had the ability to predict the impact that potential regulation of climate change pollution would have on the firm's operations. The investigation found that Peabody and its consultants in fact "made projections that such regulation would have severe impacts on the company," Schneiderman's office said.
Additionally, Peabody's SEC filings and other public communications "provided incomplete and one-sided discussions" of the International Energy Agency's projections related to future world coal demand, the investigation showed.

In full thrust over climate change; GOP pushes back on Obama's plan that may clog Keystone pipeline

President Obama said Tuesday that his State Department should not sign off on the Keystone XL oil pipeline if it increases greenhouse gas emissions.
"Our national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution," Obama said during a major address on global warming at Georgetown University.
He made the statement on a warm day in Washington while outlining his new "climate action plan."
It  includes new rules to restrict what the president called "the limitless dumping" of carbon pollution from power plants, as well as the promotion of renewable energy sources and new energy-efficiency standards.
Obama said he would direct agencies to help brace the nation for existing effects of climate change, including hotter temperatures and stronger storms. He also pledged to seek new global agreements on climate change.
Warning that climate change threatens future generations, Obama told his college audience that "the question is not whether we need to act ... the question now is whether we will have the courage to act before it's too late."
In discussing efforts to reduce carbon pollution, Obama said he would direct the Interior Department to permit new wind, solar and other renewable energy projects on public lands, enough to power more than 6million homes by 2020.
Almost all of the president's plan involves executive actions that do not require congressional approval.
Republicans and members of the energy industry criticized Obama's climate change plan, saying it will lead to higher utility bills and less development of reliable energy.
The policies "will shutter power plants, destroy good-paying American jobs and raise electricity bills for families that can scarcely afford it," House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said.
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Obama's plan is a "war on coal" that translates to a "war on jobs."
Congressional Republicans are also major backers of the Keystone  pipeline, saying it will create jobs and increase the nation's energy supply. The project is being reviewed by the State Department because it crosses the U.S.-Canadian border.
Although Obama and aides said the State Department is making an independent judgment, Obama told the crowd at Georgetown that "the net effects of the pipeline's impact on our climate will be absolutely critical to determining whether this project is allowed to go forward."
Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck cited studies showing that the pipeline would not affect oil development in the Canadian tar sands and  would have little environmental effect. "The standard the president set today should lead to speedy approval of the Keystone pipeline," Buck said.
Obama  pledged to work with any willing Republicans but repeatedly criticized GOP members for ignoring or disputing the science behind climate change.
"We don't have time for a meeting of the Flat Earth Society," Obama said at one point.
Obama also disputed the Republican contention that environmental and climate regulations hurt the economy, saying they can actually encourage growth and innovation.
Environmental groups rallied around Obama's plan.
"Americans are already dealing with worse droughts, wildfires and coastal floods, and the practical realities of climate change are forcing political leaders to make this a priority," said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Insurers not so hot on climate change; Report: Most unprepared for mounting claims

Most insurance companies do not have comprehensive strategies to cope with climate change despite mounting weather-related claims, says a report out  Thursday.
Of 184 companies surveyed, only 23 had such strategies, and 13 of those that did were foreign-owned, according to a report by Ceres, a Boston-based non-profit that promotes eco-minded business practices.
The report says the most prepared tend to be the largest companies, with scientists on staff, and those that insure property rather than life or health.
Many companies "won't talk about climate change" and if they do, they use "hedged" language to avoid the controversial issue of whether it's man-made, says author Sharlene Leurig, senior manager of Ceres' insurance program. She says the issue is less politically divisive in Europe, where insurers are often better prepared.
The report comes as weather-related disasters cost an estimated $100 billion in damages last year,  and the U.S. government's latest National Climate Assessment  says climate change increases the risks and severity of heat waves, downpours, droughts and wildfires as well as the intensity of hurricanes.
The report's findings are based on responses by insurers doing at least $300 million worth of business in California, New York and Washington -- states that mandate they participate in a survey to disclose their plans.
Ceres evaluated the companies for how seriously they study climate-related risks and take steps to reduce them, such as lowering their own and their clients' energy use and greenhouse gas emissions.
Others say the insurance industry is stepping up to the challenge. It's made 1,148 efforts to adapt and mitigate climate change, according to a study released in December by Evan Mills, a scientist at the federally funded Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
He said insurers have introduced at least 130 energy-efficient products and services and paid claims encouraging their use in rebuilding after a loss.
Leurig says Mills looked at the largest global insurers, while her study evaluated both large and smaller companies working in the United States. Still, the industry says it's ready.
"They (insurers and re-insurers) have been dealing with climate variability and volatility in every corner of the globe for decades," says Robert Hartwig, president of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group. "The industry globally has never been stronger, despite record catastrophic losses in recent years."
Hartwig says the industry had no trouble covering the 1.5 million claims worth an estimated $25 billion in damage from Superstorm Sandy last year.
He says smaller insurers are no less prepared, because they can access the scientific expertise of their brokers and re-insurers.
Washington Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler agrees the industry is now financially solid but says it can  do more to prepare.
He cites its efforts to boost auto safety by advocating seat belts and air bags.
He says it could do the same with climate change by encouraging people to build more-resilient structures in less-risky areas.
Kreidler says he worries that insurers will react to major losses by  boosting premiums, adding exclusions or pulling out of devastated areas, leaving communities without coverage or taxpayers with the tab.
He says climate change can be that kind of "game-changer."

Latest climate change report puts deniers on the hot seat

One way to deal with a problem is to pretend it doesn't exist. This approach has the virtue of relieving you from having to come up with a solution, spend money or make tough choices. The downside, of course, is that leaky faucets and other problems rarely solve themselves and, in fact, usually get worse if ignored.
Such is the case with climate change, a threat that too many members of Congress, most of them Republicans, have decided to manage by denying the science. That head-in-the-sand approach avoids messy discussions of higher energy prices, but it just got harder to justify.
Late last week, the nation's pre-eminent scientific advisory group, the National Research Council arm of the National Academy of Sciences, issued a report called "America's Climate Choices." As scientific reports go, its key findings were straightforward and unequivocal: "Climate change is occurring, is very likely caused primarily by human activities, and poses significant risks to humans and the environment." Among those risks in the USA: more intense and frequent heat waves, threats to coastal communities from rising sea levels, and greater drying of the arid Southwest.
Coincidentally, USA TODAY's Dan Vergano reported Monday, a statistics journal retracted a federally funded study that had become a touchstone among climate-change deniers. The retraction followed complaints of plagiarism and use of unreliable sources, such as Wikipedia.
Taken together, these developments ought to leave the deniers in the same position as the "birthers," who continue to challenge President Obama's American citizenship  a vocal minority that refuses to accept overwhelming evidence.
The Climate Choices report didn't generate big headlines because its conclusions aren't new; they are consistent with the scientific consensus about global warming. That consensus acknowledges some uncertainty in the extent to which climate change is the result of human activity, and how bad global warming will be if nothing is done.
Even so, as the report says, "uncertainly is not a reason for inaction," and the most effective national response to climate change would be to "substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
If the deniers want a more legitimate basis for resistance, it is this: Even bold and costly national U.S. actions to limit greenhouse gases will be ineffective unless developing nations also curb their emissions. It's hard to imagine China and India acting, however, if the U.S. doesn't lead.
The Climate Choices report, requested by Congress, suggests investing in clean-energy technology, looking for ways to mitigate and adapt to climate change, and  most important  putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions. "Cap-and-trade," a complex but proven way to use market forces to reduce pollution, passed the House in 2009. Like health care reform, though, it has become so unpopular in GOP circles that at the first Republican presidential debate this month, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty abjectly apologized for once supporting the idea. "I've said I was wrong," Pawlenty groveled. "It was a mistake, and I'm sorry."
For now, his party's rejectionist stance is unrivaled among major political parties, including conservative ones, around the warming planet. The latest scientific report provides clarity that denial isn't just a river in Egypt. It paves a path to a future fraught with melting ice caps, rising sea levels, shifting agricultural patterns, droughts and wildfires.
Leaky faucets, indeed.

Mounting evidence proves that climate change is here and now

All too often, global warming is discussed as something that will affect future generations of people, penguins and polar bears. That it will. But a mounting body of evidence demonstrates that climate change is neither distant nor theoretical. It is here and now:
The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the internationally accepted authority on the subject, concludes that the climate system has warmed dramatically since the 1950s, and that scientists are 95% to 100% sure human influence has been the dominant cause. In the Northern Hemisphere, 1983 to 2012 was likely the warmest 30-year period of the past 1,400 years, the IPCC found. Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide -- have jumped to levels unprecedented in at least the past 800,000 years.
A year-long USA TODAY special report, "Weathering the Change," documents how climate change is already affecting Americans. Risk and intensity of heat waves, downpours, drought and wildfires are increasing. Sea levels are rising. The oceans are becoming more acidic. In Alaska, glaciers and permafrost are melting.
A report released in September by the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society analyzed 12 extreme weather events last year and found compelling evidence that human-caused climate change contributed to half of them. For example, the report concluded, about 35% of the extreme warmth experienced in the eastern U.S. in March-May 2012 can be attributed to man-made factors.
All this ought to be enough to shift the political debate, once and for all, from whether global warming is real to how to respond. Instead, the skeptics have seized on one piece of the 2,216-page IPCC report to renew their contention that concern is overblown.
The report found that the rate of surface warming over the past 15 years (1998-2012) was smaller than the rate calculated since 1951. This "pause" suggests some of the climate models that predicted faster warming are flawed, and natural climate variability is powerful. But it doesn't prove that warming has stopped or is inconsequential.
For one thing, much of the excess warmth being put into the climate system by greenhouse gases is sinking into the world's oceans. For another, 1998 was an extreme outlier of a warm year, thanks to El Niño, a warming of tropical Pacific water that can affect temperatures and weather around the world. Using 1998 as a starting point for a temperature trend is a bit like using Babe Ruth's 60 home runs in 1927 as a benchmark for power hitting.
Perhaps the most sobering part of the IPCC report is its conclusion that "most aspects of climate change will persist for many centuries even if emissions of carbon dioxide are stopped." This doesn't mean it's pointless to put a price on carbon pollution, or to negotiate cuts with China and other big emitters. But it shows that the response will also have to include adaptation, geoengineering research and investments in green alternatives to fossil fuels.
The latest findings ensure one other thing: In 50 years, Americans are far less likely to be talking about this month's budget follies in Washington than they are to be asking why this generation was warned about the risks of man-made climate change and didn't do more about them.

Pope links financial crisis, climate change

As President-elect Barack Obama prepared to take office at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, his then-chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, famously said that no serious crisis should go to waste, suggesting that it would now be possible to put in long-needed reforms.
But in the view of many critics, the crisis was indeed wasted, and the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform act, whatever its merits, fell short of the radical restructuring needed to forestall a repeat of the crisis, perhaps in the very near future.
"The financial crisis of 2007-08 provided an opportunity to develop a new economy, more attentive to ethical principles, and new ways of regulating speculative financial practices and virtual wealth," one of the newest critics of financial reform wrote last week. "But the response to the crisis did not include rethinking the outdated criteria which continue to rule the world."
This was not another broadside against the banks from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., or another blast at Wall Street from independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as he seeks the Democratic nomination for president.
This was the verdict of Pope Francis, who couched his urgent call for a more vigorous response to climate change in terms of subordinating economic growth and financial power to the welfare of humankind and the future of the planet.
The pope, a Jesuit and former archbishop of Buenos Aires, criticized the political response to the financial crisis in words that perfectly described the actions of the Obama administration.
"Saving banks at any cost, making the public pay the price, foregoing a firm commitment to reviewing and reforming the entire system," Francis wrote in his second papal encyclical, "only reaffirms the absolute power of a financial system, a power which has no future and will only give rise to new crises after a slow, costly and only apparent recovery."
Focusing on the need to combat climate change, the pope rejected the neoliberal mantra that uninhibited economic growth and unrestricted free markets are the keys to long-term prosperity.
"Some circles maintain that current economics and technology will solve all environmental problems," Francis wrote, "that the problems of global hunger and poverty will be resolved simply by market growth."
But their actions belie their words, he continued, "by showing no interest in more balanced levels of production, a better distribution of wealth, concern for the environment and the rights of future generations."
The pope's encyclical -- "Laudato Si', On Care for Our Common Home" -- is not intended as a dogmatic pronouncement but as a pastoral admonition, a moral call to action not only for Catholics but for society as a whole.
The pope's ready acceptance of the science on climate change -- Francis was trained as a chemist -- and his rejection of Darwinian capitalism strike progressive notes that create difficulties for Catholic politicians in this country who until now have looked to a reliably reactionary Vatican to support their conservative views.
Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush showed something less than the zeal of a convert in offhandedly dismissing the thoughts from his pastor in chief.
"I hope I'm not going to get castigated for saying this by my priest back home, but I don't get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinals or my pope," Bush said on the campaign trail in New Hampshire. "I think religion ought to be about making us better as people, less about things (that) end up getting into the political realm."
Other Republican hopefuls who are Catholic -- Marco Rubio, Rick Santorum, Bobby Jindal, Chris Christie -- have distanced themselves from the pope's message  or will likely do so when given the opportunity. As Bush implied, they will no doubt reject his thoughts on the economy and financial system as well. But in the pope's view they are all inextricably linked.
"The lessons of the global financial crisis have not been assimilated, and we are learning all too slowly the lessons of environmental deterioration," Francis wrote. He minced no words, saying it is "remarkable" how weak the political responses -- to the financial crisis, to climate change -- have been.
"The failure of global summits on the environment make it plain that our politics are subject to technology and finance," he says in the encyclical. "There are too many special interests, and economic interests easily end up trumping the common good and manipulating information so that their own plans will not be affected."
Ironically, it is Sanders, who is Jewish and who called the pope a "miracle for humanity" in a television interview Friday, who was the first of the presidential candidates to wholeheartedly embrace the pope's message.
It remains to be seen if the head of the Roman church has also struck a chord with a majority of Americans, who may well be ahead of their politicians in their concern for the environment and their dissatisfaction with the inequality resulting from an economy of greed.
Francis used the megaphone of the papacy to broadcast a message on the environment and the economy that will have repercussions in our own politics. As the 2016 election approaches, candidates will ignore it at their peril.

New Mexico gets taste of dry future; Some say this year's warm, parched weather is start of climate change projected for next century

New Mexico got a stark glimpse this year of what the future could be if steps aren't taken to curb climate change.
A state report last month predicted a possible rise of 8-12 degrees in New Mexico's average temperature by the end of this century. That would bring hotter summers and shorter, warmer winters with less snow, the 47-page study said.
New Mexico's chief environmental official says the forecast describes the state's plight already.
"In New Mexico this year, we have no ski areas operating on natural snow," says Ron Curry, secretary of the state's Environment Department. He notes the huge loss last year of pinyon pines -- the state tree -- because of a beetle infestation that was worsened by drought and warmth. "This just adds to the argument of what global warming is doing to the climate."
Climate scientists may debate whether severe drought in the Southwest is a sign that climate change is already here, but there is little dispute that drier, warmer conditions in the region are a taste of what life may be like if Earth's temperature continues to rise.
'Big ecological changes'
"The big ecological changes are really beginning ... in the West," says Tom Swetnam of the University of Arizona's Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research, which tracks climate change through tree growth. "We're seeing some of the effects already -- massive forest die-offs, outbreaks of severe forest fires. Whatever affects the watershed is potentially devastating."
Earth's average temperature rose at least 1 degree in the 20th century, according to the World Meteorological Organization. But the rise has accelerated since 1976. Last year tied with 1998 for the warmest on record, and nine of the 10 warmest years have occurred since 1995.
Swetnam, who serves on Arizona's climate advisory group, says those who blame periodic drought, not global warming, for forest destruction in the Southwest cannot ignore even worse conditions in British Columbia. Almost 50million acres of forest there are dead or dying from a bark-beetle infestation, as in the Southwest.
"It's tied to extraordinarily warm temperatures in that part of Canada, not drought," Swetnam says. "If that was happening in the northeastern U.S., maybe this would get some attention."
In New Mexico and several other Western states, it has.
When Gov. Bill Richardson ordered New Mexico's climate study last June, he also set targets for cutting "greenhouse gases," such as carbon dioxide from power plants and vehicle exhaust, which trap heat in the atmosphere. Nationally, those emissions have been growing an average of 1% a year since 1990. On Monday, the Environmental Protection Agency reported a 1.7% jump in carbon dioxide for 2004, the latest year data are available.
New Mexico's first goal is to curtail emissions in 2012 to year 2000 levels, when the state discharged 91.3 million tons of greenhouse gases. That reduction of about 10% would be the equivalent of removing about 150,000 vehicles from the state's roads. Subsequent cuts would aim for another 10% by the year 2020 and 75% less by 2050.
Richardson also named a climate advisory group to recommend by the end of this year how to begin cutting emissions. Last fall, he made New Mexico the only state to join the Chicago Climate Exchange, an experimental market of companies, non-profit groups and local governments that earn and trade credits for cutting greenhouse emissions.
Membership obligates the state government to cut its own discharges -- mainly from state-owned vehicles and buildings -- by 4% by year's end. If it can't, New Mexico must buy emission "allowances" from other members to offset what it fails to trim.
In December, Business Week's list of the world's top 20 "individual achievers" in cutting emissions named six Westerners, including Richardson and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Vickie Patton of Environmental Defense, says, "It's the classic American West ethic that we would step up and tackle global-warming pollution head-on. It's such a direct threat to our quality of life and our dependence on a fragile water supply."
New Mexico's climate-change report foresees less water for cities and towns, agriculture and other needs because less snow will accumulate in the mountains during shorter, warmer winters. New Mexico, like other states, relies on the snowpack's annual melting for most of its water supply.
Extreme weather and more
The report predicted extreme weather that includes floods and longer droughts, wildfires, water loss from evaporation, extinction of wild species, invasion of non-native plants, air pollution and disruption of agriculture, tourism and the environment.
"We do say it is 'potential,'" says Sandra Ely of the New Mexico Environment Department. "We're not making any bets on what the precipitation will be, but it's pretty darn clear temperatures are going to increase."
Stephen Saunders, president of Colorado's Rocky Mountain Climate Organization, says disruption of the West's snow and water will make it "harder to support our current population, let alone the growing population that everybody predicts in the West because this is such an attractive place."

Life after climate change

"Every single proposed solution will simultaneously improve life and decrease carbon emissions," said Noah Diffenbaugh, a professor of climate science at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who has provided testimony and scientific expertise to the White House, the governor of California and U.S. congressional offices.
These predictions presume that the shift to carbon-neutral energy, industrial and transportation systems will happen in time to slow and eventually reverse the effects of global warming the planet is already beginning to experience: rising oceans, more flooding, worse storms and increased heat waves and droughts.
Whatever happens next, experts said, depends entirely on how quickly we act. Many of these technological and policy changes have begun but need to be sped up, they said. Humans pour 37 gigatons of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere annually. People must shift away from those carbon emissions within the next 20 years to avoid "rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society," according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
A day in a new world
For Earth Day, let's presume we've  made that shift to a carbon-neutral world and you, your children or your grandchildren are waking up on a crisp fall morning sometime between 2050 and 2100. What's the day like?
Houses won't look all that different, though homes will almost certainly have solar power if it's appropriate for the area.  That will be especially important in hot and sunny parts of the country, to decrease the pressure on power production for cooling during the day. California has a law requiring that all  homes built after 2020 include solar panels.
Homes will still have heat and cooling, electric lights, lots of electronics and big windows, but the systems and appliances will be much more efficient.
This shift is already happening - refrigerators are about 20% larger but use one-quarter the electricity compared  with those sold 20 years ago. The LED lightbulbs you buy at the grocery store use 20% of the energy the incandescent bulbs of a decade ago did, said Jay Apt, a physicist and professor who directs the Electricity Industry Center at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
When  people get out of bed, the house will  be a comfortable temperature. Properties will probably still have a furnace or an electric heat pump, but they won't be used as much because homes will be much better insulated.
The systems used to heat buildings probably will look different from the ones we know. One example already used in some  buildings involves preheating or chilling water  when power is cheap,  then using it during the day when power is more expensive.
After getting out of bed, the next step might be to check the dishwasher to get out a cup for coffee. The dishwasher, along with most appliances, will probably be tied to a smart system in your house that knows the power cost at different times of the day. If the power company gets significant power from wind turbines, the cheapest power may be at night. If it's from solar, it might be cheapest during the day.
"Your dishwasher may very well communicate with the electric power grid and say, 'OK, Mr. Smith has decided that he only wants to run his dishwasher only when the price of power is less than 12 cents per kilowatt-hour,' so your dishwasher may decide to run at 2 in the morning," Apt says.
Or you might set an override to tell the appliance that whatever the price, the dishes have to be done by 6 p.m., in time for dinner.
Here a turbine, there a turbine
Coal, oil and many natural-gas-fired power plants will have long ago closed. The nation will probably be powered by a mix of nuclear, wind, solar and hydroelectric energy and some natural gas.
The power grid will have been rebuilt to accommodate more periodic power inputs, which will afford  better protection against physical and cyberattacks.
When people drive across America, the sight of large solar arrays or wind turbines will be common, much like  oil rigs are  an everyday sight now. You might run across tall arrays that pull carbon dioxide out of the air and turn it into fuel and the raw material for industrial uses.
Fun cars, fast charging
The car of the future will be electric because electricity is easy to generate from carbon-neutral sources such as wind, solar and nuclear. It's a shift that has begun.  In Norway, 58% of all cars sold in March were electric, according to Norway's Road Traffic Information Council.
That's a far cry from the less than 1% of cars in the USA that are electric. The experts presume the shift will happen relatively quickly. It won't be wrenching, said Chris Field, director of Stanford University's Woods Institute for the Environment.
"The electric car I have right now is the best car I've ever had. It's a Chevy Bolt. It's very practical, well thought out and fun to drive. It's a really great car," he said.
Those future cars will probably have a range between charges far greater than today's 225 miles. Estimates put it at 400 miles by 2028. There will probably be fast-charging outlets nationwide, just as there are gas stations today.
Already, homes in Atlanta must be built to accommodate electric vehicles.
Accessible cities
More people will live in cities, which produce far fewer greenhouse gasses per person than suburbs. The cities will be designed with the kind of human-friendly density being incorporated into plans across the globe.
Cities, which will have mostly apartment buildings and townhouses, will be walkable and have bike paths. Excellent mass transit will be available via electric buses and vans. Businesses and office buildings will be interspersed rather than plunked down miles out of town in office parks and malls.
People will choose space to spread out or cheaper land and housing, preferences made more sustainable because of the increasing ability to work from home or commute by electric vehicles.
Telecommuting for fun and profit
Work will be more integrated with living areas. Offices will  be built to high standards to reduce waste, save water and conserve energy.
More than 33,000 buildings in the USA have gotten LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification, marking them as highly efficient.
Not that everyone will go to an office every day. Telecommuting all or part of the time will become more common as the tools for doing so - fast Internet and good video connections - become cheaper, better and easier to use. More people will work from communal workspaces near their homes.
Big U.S. companies are beginning to do this. Amazon, Apple and Google have dozens of offices across the nation where people can work, so employees don't all need to move to Silicon Valley in California or to Seattle.
Many people are used to working from shared office spaces such as WeWork and ImpactHub.
Rethinking food
What's old will be new again in many ways when it comes to food and farming, experts said. The nation's food supply is likely to be fresher and more wholesome as growers and sellers become better at managing logistics to minimize travel time and loss.
"We've gotten into this mode that we expect to see blueberries and oranges every week of the year. As energy costs go higher and water becomes even in more short supply in the future, not every type of food will be available at every moment," said Robert Myers, a professor of agriculture at the University of Missouri in Columbia and an expert on climate change and sustainable agriculture.
Amanda Little, author of the forthcoming book "The Fate of Food: What We'll Eat in a Bigger, Hotter, Smarter World," said mankind will probably  eat the same kinds of food we eat today, but it will be produced differently and much more efficiently.
That's especially true of meat, which Little predicted will be either plant-based faux meat or vat-grown tissue that is identical to meat on a cellular level. "It's very inefficient to raise an entire animal just to eat the edible parts of it," she said.
Meat from animals, what we'll call "craft" or "specialty meat," will still be available.
Little said cell-based meat is closer than we realize. She had some vat-grown duck last week.
"It was chewy and greasy, but it tasted very meaty," she said. "For a very early stage lab meat product, it was very convincing."
Farms will look the same  as we drive by, but a closer look will show differences. Older practices, such as planting clover and other cover crops during the winter, will be more common to improve soil health, making the ground more able to withstand floods or drought and decrease the amount of fertilizer needed. Complex crop rotations, aided by computers, will make farming more efficient and cheaper because less fertilizer and pesticides will be required.
Fields might have drones buzzing over them or small robots running down the rows,  testing the soil for moisture and nutrients and  imaging the crops for weed or insect infestations. That information will be automatically fed to the farmer, who can use it to precisely water and care for each small land unit, rather than wasting expensive water and chemicals.
Those fields will probably incorporate wind turbines or solar panels to give growers additional income. Many farms in the Midwest  get rents of $3,000 to $5,000 per year to put turbines on their land, Apt said.
Energy for everyone
The world's air and water will be cleaner  once we stop using polluting energy sources. The planet's resources will become more equitable as carbon-neutral energy sources become cheaper and more efficient, which will make  them available to people in parts of the world where energy is  expensive and difficult to obtain.
It's all doable - no breakthroughs required, Stanford's Diffenbaugh said:  "The knowledge necessary for getting on that path is available."
What would life be like if we solved climate change? Better than today or worse? Mud huts and gruel, or flying cars and the Jetsons?  Comfy homes, good food, whip-smart appliances and robots hopping around on farms all seem pretty likely, experts queried by USA TODAY said. All in all, our living standard would be the same, only a lot greener and more efficient.  Their view is in stark contrast to a common complaint by those who object to making global-warming-based changes to the economy, suggesting such changes would destroy America's standard of living and force everyone to "live in yurts and eat tofu," as one commenter put it.

Al Gore's 'Inconvenient Sequel' brings climate change to the trump era; New film is an updated, more intimate view

On June 1, President Trump announced his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, an international agreement aimed at helping countries reduce the effects of climate change.
It was a devastating blow for former vice president Al Gore, a tireless environmental activist who drew heat for his Oscar-winning global-warming documentary An Inconvenient Truth in 2006. He's back with its follow-up, An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power (in theaters Friday in New York and Los Angeles, expands nationwide Aug. 4), which premiered at Sundance Film Festival in January to respectable reviews.
Despite having several conversations with the president, Gore has been unable to sway Trump, who has  called global warming an "expensive hoax."
"I tried as hard as I could, and even though hope springs eternal, I don't think there's any realistic prospect of Donald Trump coming to his senses on climate," Gore says. "I would love to be proven wrong, but I'm not going to hold my breath. We'll just have to work around him."
Like Truth, Sequel is loosely framed around a presentation Gore gives to environmental activists-in-training, listing findings about climate-related weather events and touting alternatives to burning fossil fuels. But the documentary also moves into the real world, as filmmaking duo Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk follow Gore across the globe as he meets with political leaders and typhoon survivors, and attends the United Nations' climate-change summit in Paris in 2015.
"For so long, it was very difficult for people in the environmental movement to personalize the issue and make it immediate for people's everyday lives," Shenk says. "As storytellers, we had an 'aha' moment of 'If we tell the stories of people who are actually suffering and dealing with the front-line issues of climate change, then it could be film drama.'"
It was jarring at first for the politician to be shadowed so closely.
"It does take a little adjusting to have them following your every move practically for two years," Gore says.
With the sequel, Gore wanted to show what's changed, both good and bad, in the decade since Truth. At the original film's release, he was criticized for using a  simulation depicting the flooding of lower Manhattan to illustrate how  cities could feel the effects of  rising sea levels. That  came to pass in 2012, when the World Trade Center memorial was underwater during Hurricane Sandy.
But Gore has reason to be optimistic. As shown in the film, Georgetown, Texas, is one of the first cities in America to be 100% powered by renewable energy, with others such as Atlanta and Pittsburgh pledging to follow suit.
"The will to survive is itself a renewable resource," Gore says. "With Mother Nature playing an increasingly prominent role in the discussions about the climate, more and more people are realizing if the president won't lead, the American people must."

Climate change: A civil rights issue for blacks

Climate change is more than an environmental issue. It is a human rights and economic justice issue. Why? Because though climate change impacts all of us, different nations, and different communities within nations, experience the effects of climate change in varying ways, some worse than others.
This point was clearly made at last month's U.N. climate change conference in Copenhagen, where it quickly became evident that the rich and powerful nations -- particularly the U.S. and members of the European Union -- dictate the debate at the expense of poorer countries. That needs to change.
I was part of the only African-American delegation at the conference as a member of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies' Commission to Engage African Americans on Climate Change. We were there because African Americans have a dog in this fight. We produce less greenhouse gas emissions (about 20% less than other Americans, according to a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation study),  but we bear a greater burden in terms of pollution and climate change.
Robert Bullard, who runs an environmental justice program at Clark Atlanta University, has noted that the adverse impacts of climate change fall most heavily on people of color who are concentrated in urban centers, coastal regions and areas where the air quality is poor.
After Copenhagen, the U.S. has committed to reduce emission levels and has begun the slow transition to a low-carbon economy. But these policies are likely to increase the cost of gasoline and electricity, which disproportionately impact people of color. The non-partisan Center for Budget and Policy Priorities says that even a modest 15% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions would cost the poorest fifth of Americans an average of about $750 a year per household.  While both the Senate and House  energy bills include proposals to offset costs to help the poor, the aid allotted is less than is necessary to fully protect low-income consumers.
According to a Joint Center poll on global warming, 54% of African Americans considered it a major problem and 24% a moderate problem. Awareness, however, has not resulted in activism.
If African Americans are not fully engaged in the climate justice movement, and if the differential impacts of new policies are not explored, the poor will pay from their pocketbooks and with their health. That is why climate change is not just an environmental issue, but an important civil rights issue for people of color.

Obama to call for carbon cuts at power plants; Game plan to address climate change likely to take a long, global view

President Obama plans to announce new rules today to restrict carbon pollution at new and existing power plants, part of what he calls a comprehensive plan to combat climate change.
In a speech at Georgetown University, Obama will also direct the Interior Department to permit new wind, solar, and other renewable energy projects on public lands, enough to power 6-million-plus homes by 2020.
New energy-efficiency projects are also part of the climate change plan, according to a blueprint provided by the White House.
In a video announcing the speech, Obama said he would lay out "a national plan to reduce carbon pollution, prepare our country for the impacts of climate change and lead global efforts to fight it."
Although "no single step" can reverse the existing effects of climate change, Obama said that "when it comes to the world we leave our children, we owe it to them to do what we can." He also will outline plans to prepare the nation for the impact of global warming and to seek new international agreements to address climate change on a global scale, the blueprint says.
Most of the climate change plan involves executive actions that don't require congressional approval. The president could have a difficult time getting his environmental agenda through Congress,  given a U.S. House run by Republicans and a Senate in which the GOP has enough members to mount effective filibusters.
Republicans and members of the energy industry are likely to criticize Obama's climate change plan, saying it will lead to higher utility bills and less development of reliable energy.
The president is not expected to discuss another major environmental issue in his speech: the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada into the U.S., a project still under review by the State Department.
According to the White House blueprint, Obama will direct the Environmental Protection Agency to work with states, industry and other stakeholders to establish new carbon pollution standards for new and existing plants. He also plans to direct federal agencies to help state and local governments with existing problems caused by climate change -- such as improved flood protection for roads and other infrastructure, better hospitals to respond to increasingly powerful storms, and drought relief.
Calling for action on climate change in his State of the Union Address on Feb. 12, Obama said that "some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms."
As part of a global approach to climate change, Obama plans to call for an end of  federal support for public financing of new coal-fired plants overseas. Exceptions would be made "for the most efficient coal technology available in the world's poorest countries, or facilities deploying carbon capture and sequestration technologies," according to the blueprint.

High and dry in Texas; Water fights (and not the fun kind) are plaguing the Lone Star State as climate change raises the heat -- and the stakes.

In this browning patch of land in central Texas, C.J. Teare could be fined for using fresh water to keep her decades-old oak trees alive, so she relies on soapy water left over from washing clothes.
"I've never seen it like this before," says Teare, a grandmother who has lived in her modest Lakeside Beach ranch for 20 years. Her community has been under emergency water restrictions since January 2012, when it became the first to run dry during Texas' ongoing three-year drought. It stays afloat with six daily truckloads of water.
Thirty miles southeast near Austin, Pete Clark had to close one restaurant along Lake Travis, and the other has lost 75% of its business since 2011. Water levels are so low that Carlos n' Charlie's, once a popular floating Tex-Mex watering hole, is no longer even lakeside.
An hour upstream along Lake Buchanan, Rusty Brandon is filing for bankruptcy. He says potential customers say "never mind" when he tells them there's no water for boating or fishing at his Hi-Line Lake Resort. Whatever its cause, he says, "I'm literally on the front line of experiencing climate change daily."
These are the faces of drought in the Lone Star State, where water has become such a Texas-size problem that some desperate residents do rain dances while others hope for tropical storms.
USA TODAY traveled to the Austin area, where nightly city patrols issue fines to residents who violate water restrictions, as the fifth stop in a year-long series to explore places where climate change is changing lives.
Though drought has several causes, climate scientists say global warming is a long-term contributor that could be exacerbating conditions, especially in the already-arid Southwest. They say it will probably do more damage. Why? Higher temperatures cause more water to evaporate, and unless there's enough rain to offset that, the ground dries up.
More heat is on the way, too. U.S. temperatures are expected to rise 3 to 10 degrees by 2100, partly because of the heat-trapping greenhouse gases emitted in the burning of fossil fuels, according to a draft copy of the third National Climate Assessment, a federal report compiled by hundreds of government and academic scientists. As a result, the report expects summer droughts to intensify in most U.S. regions as well as enduring water shortages in the Southwest, Southeast and Hawaii.
Drought, which struck as much as two-thirds of the land in the lower 48 contiguous states last year, still afflicts 44% of that area and 87% of Texas, the U.S. Drought Monitor reports. The National Weather Service predicts it will persist or intensify in much of the western USA, including the western half of Texas where drought caused billions of dollars in damage in 2011 from crop failures, herd die-offs and wildfires.
"Climate change is likely prolonging the duration and severity of naturally occurring drought in the Southwest," says Martin Hoerling, a research meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. He says the main cause of U.S. drought is a lack of rainfall, but by century's end, the key culprit might be higher temperatures.
Texas, prone to drought, is particularly vulnerable. Its supply of water is shrinking while its demand for water is rising amid a boom in population and fossil fuel production. In hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, huge amounts of water are blasted underground to break apart rock and retrieve oil or gas trapped inside.
Tiffs over fracking
Conflicts are flaring between frackers, who are giving what landowners call "mailbox money" for the right to tap their water wells, and residents whose wells are running dry. Tiffs have arisen even within families, as some take the money and others don't. Much of Texas fracking is done in the northern Barnett Shale near Fort Worth and the southern Eagle Ford Shale.
In the Austin area, where fracking isn't an issue, lawsuits have been filed over water distribution as business owners upstream compete with rice farmers downstream.
"This drought has affected everyone, up and down the basin," says Ryan Rowney of the Lower Colorado River Authority, a quasi-state agency that runs local water systems.
Last year and again this spring, the LCRA cut off water to most rice farmers because reservoir levels reached record lows in Lakes Travis and Buchanan. Rowney says levels are "rivaling those of the 1950s drought -- the drought of record," a seven-year dry spell that caused agricultural and other losses estimated at $22 billion.
"Things are likely to get worse," says Robert Mace, who directs water science and conservation at the Texas Water Development Board. Statewide, he says, reservoir levels are at their lowest since at least 1990. By year's end, 29 Texas communities could follow Spicewood Beach and adjacent Lakeside Beach in running out of water, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, a state agency.
That's left many wondering what the future holds as temperatures rise.
"I'm not a firm believer that men are a source of climate change," says Brandon, who's laid off all workers at his deserted "lake" resort. Still, whatever its cause, he sees its impact:
The link between climate change and drought is complicated. Drought has multiple causes that include year-to-year climate patterns such as La Niña and decadal shifts in ocean temperatures. Climate scientists say it remains a challenge, despite improved computer models, to figure out what portion of drought can be attributed to global warming.
"This is not quite like rocket science," Hoerling says, adding that climate modeling is more "interpretive."
He co-authored a report, released in April, that says global warming played little, if any, role in last year's historic drought in the central Great Plains. He says the main cause was a lack of moisture that usually sweeps up from the Gulf of Mexico.
Other climate scientists, acknowledging the role of these weather patterns and natural variability, say climate change exacerbated the 2012 drought partly by helping to keep the jet stream north.
"All these three factors combine to contribute to the dry conditions in Texas and elsewhere in the Southwest," says Gerald Meehl, senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a federally funded laboratory.
Despite year-to-year fluctuations in these areas, he says, "you have this long-term trend toward dryness."
Global warming, by raising temperatures, made the 2011 Texas drought "distinctly more probable" than would have occurred 40 to 50 years ago, says a study led by David Rupp and Philip Mote of Oregon State University.
Another study, co-authored by Hoerling and Texas' state climatologist, Texas A&M professor John Nielsen-Gammon, says this warming made the drought slightly worse. The researchers say it didn't affect precipitation but accounted for about 20%, or 1 degree, of the 5-degree jump in temperature above the summer norm.
What's straining the supply
What's exacerbating water worries in parts of Texas is water-intensive fracking, which is taking off in some of the state's driest areas.
Fifty-one percent of Texas' oil and gas wells were in "high or extremely high water stress" regions, according to a report in May by Ceres, a Boston-based non-profit group that promotes corporate sustainability. Nationwide, the report says, 47% of these wells are in water-stressed areas.
In Texas, water for fracking jumped 125% in three years -- from 36,000 acre-feet in 2008 to about 81,500 in 2011 -- and will continue to increase before leveling off in the 2020s, according to a University of Texas-Austin study this year by research scientist Jean-Phillippe Nicot.
The UT study says oil and gas drilling accounts for less than 1% of water use statewide. But a similar 2011 study, also by Nicot, found it accounts for at least 20% of water in some counties where fracking is big.
Hugh Fitzsimons, a Dimmit County bison rancher, suspects fracking has depleted nearby wells so much that one of his wells is running low. "I've had trouble irrigating," says Fitzsimons, whose herd has dropped from 400 in 2007 to 100.
Further east, the water-intensive process of rice farming has also generated concern.
Bob Reed, who has grown rice in Bay City since 1980, says he has been unable to plant because rice farmers were cut off from municipal water supplies the past two years.
"You can't do it without irrigation," he says, adding his land is ideally suited to rice -- not other crops.
He and other rice farmers got federal crop insurance, which Reed says covered about a third of his losses.
Mike Burnside, 65, who has grown rice on 1,000 acres in Bay City, says it's risky to buy equipment and switch to row crops such as corn, milo or soybean, because they're dependent on rain.
"I'll continue to farm," he says. "It's a calling. I'll probably die on the farm, until my wheels don't work anymore."
Clark hopes for a storm. In his 26 years of doing business along Lake Travis, nearly 56 feet below capacity,  he's seen other droughts -- and floods -- but never anything this bad.
"Droughts are a slow, painful death," Clark says, noting he might be forced to close Carlos n' Charlie's. He tries to remain optimistic, recalling how the lake once rose 36 feet in 24 hours during a storm.
"It is possible," Clark says. "That's why we stay in business, because technically it (drought) shouldn't last forever."

Unity doomed apartheid. Next up: climate change

The intense debate about dealing with climate change has mostly taken place in rich countries. The United States, European Union and China have driven negotiations, and every top-level conversation has been about what's thought to be possible -- and often what's convenient -- for these strong forces.
But as the countdown begins to the decisive Copenhagen climate talks in December, new voices are making themselves heard. These victims have become more demanding as the realities of climate change have become more apparent. Maplecroft, a global risks security group, lists 28 countries as most vulnerable to climate change, and 22 of them are in Africa.
Last month, the African Union's chief negotiator at the climate talks, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, said Africa not only would demand fair compensation for climate damage from the countries that caused the problem, but would also demand that rich nations cut emissions and hold global warming to as few degrees as humanly possible.
Science on our side
The new African assertiveness stems from new science. After Arctic sea ice melted dramatically in 2007, scientists began re-evaluating their predictions. It became clear that basic survival was at stake for many countries. The low-lying islands of the Maldives, though poor, have begun saving a portion of each year's national budget to buy a new homeland if, and when, their current home sinks beneath the waves. Kenya's ongoing drought vividly illustrates what uncontrolled climate change might bring to the African continent.
Many top scientists agree that there's a number the world needs to know. It's 350 -- as in 350 parts per million of the heat-trapping gas carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The growing consensus is that it's the most carbon we can have in the atmosphere without causing terrible climate havoc. Since we're already past that level, at 390 parts per million, it also implies that we need much swifter political action than governments have supported in the past to reverse this trend. It also means, among other things, that we need a rapid effort to replace the burning of polluting coal with cleaner energy sources everywhere.
350 and counting
Normally, voices from places such as Ethiopia, the Maldives and Kenya are sidelined in international forums. But this time, it might be different because a determined movement is building around the world.
This Saturday,  350.org, an organization that I support, will coordinate thousands of events and rallies in 170 countries to bring the number 350 to global attention.
Sharing the goals of 350.org will be internationally prominent messengers, including the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Rajendra Pachauri,  and NASA's top climate scientist, James Hansen.
Groups will gather in the world's most iconic places -- from Table Mountain in Cape Town to the tops of Himalayan peaks. Across the planet, churches will ring their bells 350 times that day. Last weekend, Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed led 13 Cabinet members in an underwater meeting to highlight the country's rising sea levels. People in almost all the nations of the earth are involved. It's the same kind of coalition that helped make the word "apartheid" known around the world.
In South Africa, we showed that if we act on the side of justice, we have the power to turn tides. Worldwide, we have a chance to start turning the tide of climate change with just such a concerted effort today.

This will only get worse; Louisiana is shrinking as climate change softens up the already-vulnerable Gulf Coast

Pelicans and pickups roam the beach, where the waves roll in and return, lapping over the open water of the Gulf of Mexico.
The water covers land that was once beach, and it has devoured land that was once marsh tucked behind this 6-square-mile barrier island, a speed bump for hurricanes headed north from the Gulf.
On this sunny day, the Tarpon Rodeo -- billed as "the oldest fishing tournament in the United States!" -- is underway, with fishing boats and truck-bed hot tubs competing in nearly equal numbers on the road. But beneath the sunshine here on the edge of this vanishing wetland, human mistakes are adding up.
Indeed, the in-your-face transformation -- a product of climate change and the rewiring of the Mississippi -- is threatening the spawning grounds for much of the nation's seafood, the pit stop for the Gulf's oil industry and the home of the beloved bayous and fishing "camps" that make life here unlike anywhere else. With every bit of wetlands lost -- each day a football field's worth -- the people and places of the Gulf Coast become that much more vulnerable to the next hurricane.
"I revel in every moment I'm out on the beaches, the bayous, the ponds," says Al Duvernay, 61, a life-long Louisianan. A retired oil industry worker, Duvernay now volunteers for efforts to rebuild the land sinking under the waves, a retreat he has seen firsthand over the course of a lifetime spent on the Mississippi River Delta. "Another part of me is compelled to come back here, because I know it is all going away."
In the past eight decades, Louisiana has lost 1,880 square miles of coastal marshes, or an area about the size of Manhattan every year. With another hurricane season upon us, it is land that Louisiana and the nation can ill afford to lose. The same threat of lost barrier islands and wetlands stalks more than half of the coastal properties of the continental United States, extending from Maine to Texas. But here in southeastern Louisiana, it's at its worst.
USA TODAY traveled to this place where the Mississippi meets the Gulf of Mexico as the sixth stop in a year-long series to explore places where climate change is changing lives.
"The sea is rising and the land is sinking," says Louisiana's state climatologist, Barry Keim, based at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. "The two together mean that wetlands are disappearing here at unprecedented rates worldwide." Add in the threat of more powerful hurricanes spurred by climate change, Keim says, "and you have to worry about the past repeating itself here."
"Louisiana is in many ways, one of the best examples of starting to see some of the near-term implications of climate change," says environmental policy expert Jordan Fischbach, of the Pardee RAND Graduate School in Pittsburgh, part of the team that last year developed tools for the state to decide what coastal restoration projects to pursue. "In some ways, I feel like it is the canary in the coal mine because they are seeing effects that change people's day-to-day lives."
Cemeteries are sinking and washing away in towns like Leeville, La., on their way to becoming isolated spits of land. Onetime orange groves and cotton fields are waterlogged.
Change here is constant but not subtle, so authorities have embarked on ambitious projects to, actually and figuratively, turn the tide. In May, the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) announced 39 projects it hoped to see reverse the damage, part of a 50-year, $50 billion plan. They range from restoring marshes to spilling fresh river water into the delta to rebuilding barrier islands.
Every 3 miles of wetlands restored means 1 foot less of  storm surge, the water wall pushed ahead of storm winds that is often one of the biggest killers in a hurricane, Keim says. "I worry a 50-year plan isn't enough, that it won't be enough," he says. "If we were talking about a 500-year plan, or a 1,000-year plan, that might be enough to bring things back."
The storm surge in Hurricane Katrina reached a record 25 to 28 feet, where it hit hardest in Mississippi. It killed 1,200 people and caused $75billion in damages, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
"Once you go through something like Katrina, you are never the same," says Duvernay, who spent the day after the storm in his fishing boat rescuing his neighbors, trapped in the upper floors of drowned homes. "You never want to see that again."
MISSISSIPPI MISTAKE
Driving along Louisiana State Highway 1, more a bridge than a road from New Orleans to Grand Isle, Hilary Collis of the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana looks across wide-open lakes and estuaries, a few slivers of sand and mud dotted with marsh grass and short, squat mangrove trees. She then points to what isn't there anymore.
"All the open water you are seeing was once wetlands," Collis says. "Just a few millimeters at a time it sank, and now it's gone." Unlike the vanished cypress trees that once dotted the marsh lining the bayou that parallels the highway, the mangroves have migrated from farther south, thriving in today's brackish water and warmer temperatures.
How did it happen? For one thing, the Mississippi River has stopped doing its job: building wetlands. A massive levee program beginning in 1927 rerouted the Mississippi and put it "in a straitjacket," Keim says, kept its freshwater and mud from spreading across the Mississippi River Delta and replenishing the marshes. So without the silt, the marshes started to sink.
"They turned off the sand and mud machine that built up the wetlands," is how Duvernay puts it.
At the same time, the sea has risen about 7 inches globally in the past century, driven by climate change, alongside an increase of Earth's average surface temperature of more than 1.4 degrees. The increase is largely due to heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, emitted into the air by burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels, boosting temperatures, according to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. On the world's coasts, the result has been a change from the past 1,900 years of stability, as a warmer ocean expands and warmer air melts glaciers, leading to higher seas.
Along Louisiana Highway 1, which carries travelers the last 60 miles from Lockport, La., to Grand Isle, the results are clear. Dead cypress trees killed by saltwater still stand in isolated spots, ringing ponds that have become brackish lakes.
"I watched it all happen, places where I could fish and camp as a child are now just open water," Duvernay says.
Keim, also a Louisiana native, sheepishly admits that he grew up as a child thinking that cypress trees just looked that way, dead. "It took a little education to figure out that the intrusion of saltwater had killed them all in the years before I was born," he says.
Louisiana 1 is also the only road to Port Fourchon, the southernmost port in Louisiana, which supports 90% of the nation's offshore oil and gas rigs. Vulnerable to flooding, the highway is the key to 18% of the nation's oil production, according to January's draft of the federal National Climate Assessment report. "Every time there is a high tide or any storm, that road goes out," Fischbach says.
And one final problem: Four major hurricanes -- Katrina (2005), Rita (2005), Gustav (2008) and Ike (2011) -- have battered the region since 2005. Eroded, inundated, cut up by oil company canals and even gnawed to the roots by invasive South American rodents called nutria ("They eat marshland in its entirety," Keim says), the wetlands' ability to halt these goliaths' storm surges has been undermined.
The same warming ocean waters that are slowly rising also look likely to deliver more powerful hurricanes to these shores. A 2010 Nature Geosciences study led by Thomas Knutson of NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, N.J., concluded that future storms would be as much as 11% more intense in this century, dropping about 20% more rain within 60 miles of their center.
On the plus side, global warming might mean that fewer storms form -- as many as 34% fewer -- in the years ahead. So we might see fewer, meaner storms, across the planet. Though the frequency question is one of the many unsettled areas of climate science, as some experts such as MIT's Kerry Emanuel predict a proliferation of storms with these warmer conditions.
The debate matters not, Keim says.
"We don't need to know the answer to look at the data and know that hurricanes have hit the Gulf Coast hard in the past," Keim says. "And the numbers tell us that where something has happened in the past, it will happen again."
WHAT CAN BE DONE?
Once a stomping ground of the pirate Jean Lafitte, Isle Grand Terre is a patch of sandy scrub curving before the Gulf of Mexico next to Grand Isle, a barrier island that shelters salty lagoons, marshes and bayous from the open sea. The island is home to five abandoned scientific buildings, the ruins of a Confederate fortress and mosquitoes that swarm visitors. It's also the home of a dune rebuilding project sponsored by local brewer Abita, which Al Duvernay volunteered for earlier this year. He and other helpers were brought in by barge in shifts to plant the dunes.
"This is success," says Collis, pointing to a strip of dune grass stalks that extends several hundred yards along a newly installed beach fence, set about 40 yards back from the surf. Sand has already started to pile up against the fence, burying slats 2 inches deep, the start of a new dune guarding the beach. Volunteers had planted 18,000 stalks in the sand over two days in March, and now they stood erect, their roots bidding to become another bulwark against a future storm.
"The idea is the dune and the dune grasses grow together, becoming larger and larger," Collis says. "If someday a hurricane comes and digs it all up then at least it will have done its job of taking some energy out of the storm."
Even so, volunteer projects -- planting grasses on dunes, or mangroves in lagoons -- go only so far. The state coastal authority's industrial-scale projects are now beginning after more than two decades of planning, arguing and voting. They received overwhelming support last year from the state Legislature. Interestingly, the state's plan doesn't mention climate change; it just assumes it will happen. The estimated rise in sea levels form the backdrop against which projects are picked for priority.
At Port Fourchon, just a few miles down from Grand Isle on the oft-flooded Louisiana 1, for example, a $5.4 million "Geotube" project now underway is stuffing 6-feet-wide fabric tubes with sand nearly a mile down the beach.
But not everything is proceeding seamlessly. The fight over the coastal restoration plan has inevitably headed to the courts. Some oyster farmers are suing the state's coastal restoration project for Mississippi freshwater diversions that could harm oyster beds. The goal of the diversion is to restore delta-building sediment to sinking parts of the region and counter the saltwater creeping ever farther inland.
The state's levee authority last month sued oil and gas companies for decades of cutting canals willy-nilly through wetlands and letting saltwater in from the Gulf. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, is disputing the levee authority's right to file the lawsuit.
CROWDING THE COASTS
Yet the legal issues often fold into the environmental ones, and those concerns lead to another place of concern along the U.S. coastlines: overdevelopment. About 39% of the U.S. population (works out to about 123 million people) now live in shoreline counties, according to Census data. The deluxe camps on Grand Isle -- seemingly almost daring the next hurricane's wrath -- are just one symptom of this rush to the coast
"Global warming doesn't make people buy beachfront condos," Keim says, pointing to another piece of the hurricane dilemma.
A quiet period for hurricanes that ended in the 1990s lured the nation toward beach living, sparking a coastal construction boom that is still underway. From Louisiana's camps and vacation homes perched high on stilt-like piers, to New Jersey's shore towns, Americans still can't get enough of warm waves and soft sand and are often undaunted by the dangers building on our coasts.
Those who are taking up this fight, though, see a silver lining in these dark clouds.
"I am happier than I have been in a long time that some places will be saved," Duvernay says.
He cites not his own volunteer efforts, or his fishing habit, but the realization that officials are starting to pay attention to this changing world.
"I'm happier there is a plan with some funding," Duvernay says, "but I still worry it might be too little, too late."

It was great to read a thoughtful conservative argument for getting on the right side of climate change politics ("Conservatives need to thaw on warming," Opinion, Friday).
Bob Inglis, a former Republican congressman, makes solid points gently but firmly, from suggesting we stop listening to "pundit-entertainers" who "tell us what we want to hear," to applying the "simple and sound principle of accountability" and finally recommending that we "attach costs to all fuels to make energy pricing transparent and inclusive."
That last part is exceedingly important. As we've seen in the living laboratory of our economy, when fossil fuels are dirt-cheap, consumers use more. Conversely, when they cost more, they use less. The best way to capitalize on this simple free-market principle is to replace our current maze of regulations and subsidies with a simple, predictable rising carbon price on fossil fuels, and then recycle all of the money right back to the taxpayers as a highly visible, equal per-capita carbon dividend.
As Inglis points out, that will encourage investors and entrepreneurs to "deliver innovation" in droves. It's high time for conservatives, liberals and everyone in between to roll up our sleeves and solve climate change together.

I suspect many  GOP politicians believe in global warming . It's just that  they are getting paid by powerful  donors to keep their mouths shut. Once businesses acknowledge global warming, they would have to make changes in how they operate,  which would affect their bottom lines.
Damon Walton
Changes in the climate are normal, natural and beyond our ability to control.
Felipe Gonzales
Adding costs to fuels is not going to solve the problem. That's robbing the poor to feed the rich businesses, which will just pass the cost down to customers.
Environmentalists wring their hands over the global climate, and the solution is for the Average Joe to pay more or use less? Get serious.

'Climate change is a medical emergency'

Global warming is making us sick.
The proportion of Earth's population that's vulnerable to heat-related death and disease continues to grow around the world because of human-caused climate change, according to a report released this week.
"Climate change is a medical emergency," said report co-author Renee Salas, a doctor of emergency medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. "It is truly harming the health of Americans and especially the most vulnerable ... children, the elderly, minorities and the poor."
Growing populations of older people, people living in cities and people with diseases are the prime reasons for the increasing vulnerability, according to the report, which was released Wednesday and published by The Lancet, a British medical journal. Last year, about 157million vulnerable people were exposed to heat waves globally. That's 18million more than in 2016.
"We're seeing increases in the frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves," said  report co-author Kristie Ebi of the University of Washington. "As our populations age and as they move into cities that have got urban heat islands, we're seeing a large increase in the number of people who are vulnerable to high temperatures."
She said another concern is that the potential geographic range of the mosquito, which can carry diseases such as dengue fever and Zika, has increased dramatically in higher temperatures.
Climate change, aka global warming, is caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the Earth's atmosphere and oceans. This has caused the planet to warm to levels that cannot be explained by natural factors.
The report, officially titled "The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change," said that in 2017, 153 billion hours of labor was lost worldwide because of heat exposure.
In 2017, the report said, there were 16 extreme weather disasters in the USA, from powerful hurricanes to catastrophic wildfires,  each of which caused more than $1 billion in damage and together cost more than $313 billion.
"While each type of disaster poses different threats to human health, they all can lead to death," according to the report. "The official death toll was estimated at 3,278 lives, though the actual number is likely much higher, highlighting the need for better surveillance."
In an editorial that accompanied the report, The Lancet warned that in the next few decades, "heatstroke and extreme weather will have redefined global labor and production beyond recognition. Multiple cities will be uninhabitable, and migration patterns will be far beyond those levels already creating pressure worldwide."
The report was written by experts from 27 academic institutions, the United Nations and intergovernmental agencies from every continent.

Come hell or high water; Climate change deniers risk both the planet and their place in history

The campaigns to remove the names of 19th century racists and colonialists from buildings and monuments raise a troubling question for today's political and business leaders: How will history judge those who would consign future generations to a world severely damaged by climate change?
When U.S. Sen. John Calhoun described slavery as a "positive good" in 1837, abolitionists had already documented the many ways in which slavery was anything but good.
When the British businessman and politician Cecil Rhodes wrote in 1877 that "it is our duty to seize every opportunity of acquiring more territory," colonialism was already under attack as immoral and counterproductive.
If any issue is as morally fraught today as slavery and colonialism were, it is climate change. Scientists have been warning for more than three decades that continued release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere will lead to catastrophic changes in the Earth's climate and ecosystems. Yet humans are now releasing about twice as much carbon from fossil fuels as in 1980.
Laws of physics
Betting against the predictions of climate scientists essentially amounts to betting against the laws of physics. As the atmosphere becomes more opaque to the infrared radiation given off by the Earth's surface, the planet inevitably will warm. Sure, a small group of contrarian scientists thinks that some sort of countervailing mechanism will offset the warming. But they have little or no evidence to support their convictions.
As essential life support systems begin to fail, people will ask whether the crises they are confronting could have been averted. Inevitably, they will focus on the politicians and business leaders who impeded action when the warnings became clear. If those decision-makers are already dead, they will be condemned posthumously, as Calhoun, Rhodes and other past leaders are being condemned today. If they are still alive, they will be asked to account for their actions.
I recently came across a similar case of retrospective condemnation, though on a smaller scale.
When Mount St. Helens began to rumble and spout ash and steam in the late winter of 1980, the governor of Washington, the prominent scientist Dixy Lee Ray, established danger zones around the mountain to keep people away from potential eruptions. But the zones were much too close to the volcano, largely because Ray and other government officials did not want to disrupt the Weyerhaeuser Co.'s logging of the old-growth forests it owned right next to the mountain.
When Mount St. Helens erupted on May 18, 1980, only three of the 57 people who died were inside the danger zones, and two had permission to be there. Ironically, the only victim of the volcano who was breaking the law was the one person people tend to remember from the eruption: the cantankerous octogenarian Harry R. Truman, who refused to leave his lodge on the northern flank of the mountain.
Tarnished legacy
Ray's failure to establish adequate safety zones tarnished her legacy as the first woman governor of Washington. But Ray, who died in 1994, was lucky. If the volcano had erupted on a weekday rather than a Sunday morning, 10 times as many people could have died, including hundreds of Weyerhaeuser loggers in the surrounding woods.
Today's climate change deniers cannot expect to be so lucky. Exactly how climate change will play out remains to be seen.
Already, troubling signs of the traumatic and often unexpected consequences of a warming world are appearing: massive die-offs of starfish off the coast of the Pacific Northwest, a geologically sudden increase in sea level, enhanced flows of refugees from parts of the world stressed by warmer temperatures and drought.
Leading Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz have also led the field in their resistance to climate science and remedies. If one of them is elected and blocks action, the consequences -- for him and for the planet -- could be severe.
In her new book Great Tide Rising: Towards Clarity and Moral Courage in a Time of Planetary Change, Oregon State University philosopher Kathleen Dean Moore calls for the use of moral reasoning, where people "affirm what they think is true or good or right and then, the crucial step, back their claims with reasons."
Future generations will apply that standard to us. We would be wise to apply it to ourselves.
Steve Olson is a Seattle-based science writer. His latest book, Eruption: The Untold Story of Mount St. Helens, was published this month.

Climate change is visible in these 10 places

Earth Day, the annual celebration to support environmental protection, falls on Monday, but for travelers, every day can offer a chance to learn about the planet.
As the climate changes across the globe, some tourism spots are in flux, says Mike Gunter Jr., a professor at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida. In his new book, "Tales of an Ecotourist: What Travel to Wild Places Can Teach Us about Climate Change" (SUNY Press, $25.95), he aims to break through misunderstandings.
"It tells stories about climate change underway and stories about amazing places," Gunter says. "It's a call to learn from travel."
He shares some examples:
Galapagos Islands, Ecuador
El Niño, a cyclical pattern of Pacific storms caused by warm water, has become stronger in recent years, researchers say. That has affected the famed Ecuadorian islands known for bird, reptile and sea life. "The El Niño years can be more intense," Gunter says. The change has even affected finches, which have evolved in a few years to adapt to the changing environment. galapagos.org
Dead Sea, Israel and Jordan
The lowest place on earth is shrinking, Gunter says. In the past 40 years, the famed salt-laden sea has diminished by a third and dropped 80 feet. Much of the change is due to increased use of water for irrigation from the Jordan River. "That's the key component," Gunter says. visitjordan.com
Venice, Italy
Flooding has long plagued the famed canal city, but it has intensified in recent years, and some areas are regularly inundated at peak high tides.
"It's a regular event, it's not just something hypothetical that we're anticipating," Gunter says. The city is developing plans to build flood walls and other barriers to keep the sea at bay. veneziaunica.it/en
Fairbanks, Alaska
A drunken forest may sound like something out of a "Harry Potter" book, but in fact, it's a change caused by rising temperatures. As permafrost, the layer of permanently frozen ground, disappears in Alaska, trees begin to tilt. "There are forests that are leaning like a hurricane blew them. They look like they've had too much to drink," Gunter says. explorefairbanks.com
Antarctic Peninsula
When climate changes, not all species react the same way. On the southern continent, gentoo penguins thrive because they build pebble nests on shorelines newly exposed by melting ice. Adelie penguins are having trouble because they fish from floating sea ice, which is less plentiful. "There are winners and losers," Gunter says. icecube.wisc.edu/pole/tourism
Greensburg, Kansas
Although not well-known, this south-central Kansas town is an environmental survivor, Gunter says. It was nearly destroyed by a tornado in 2007 but was rebuilt as one of the most eco-conscious places in the world. It was the first U.S. city to fully adopt LED street lights, and it gets 100% of its power from renewable energy.  "It's rebuilt itself stronger than before," Gunter says. greensburgks.org
Acadia National Park, Maine
Gunter worked with a scientist last year collecting data in the popular Atlantic Coast park. The area's lobster population is predicted to migrate north to seek cooler waters, as will the whales that pass by offshore. "You're seeing a shift in the types of species that exist there," Gunter says. nps.gov/acad
The Alps
Europe's famous mountain range still looms over the continent, but warming temperatures are taking their toll. Not only are its glaciers receding, but its plant life is changing as lowland species gain a foothold. "The Alps sit lower in elevation than the Rocky Mountains, so they're more susceptible," Gunter says. visiteurope.com/en/ destination/the-alps
Florida Keys
Coral reefs face pressure from warming water and a shift in the chemical composition of oceans that has bleached out color. "There's more carbon in the water," Gunter explains. "Some corals are more resilient than others. You'll see parts of a reef that look really good," but in others, change is noticeable. fla-keys.com
Glacier National Park, Montana
The glaciers that give the park its name have been in retreat for many years, peaking in the 19th century at the end of a period called the Little Ice Age. Since then, the number of glaciers in the park has dropped from about 150 to several dozen. "It's striking," Gunter says. nps.gov/glac

Facebook is tackling climate misinformation

Facebook says it's moving aggressively to counter climate-change misinformation with a Climate Science Information Center that launched Tuesday and aims to  connect users with science-based facts.
"Climate change is real," the company said. "The science is unambiguous and the need to act grows more urgent by the day."
The announcement comes just days after emergency responders in the Pacific Northwest had to fight misinformation on Facebook along with catastrophic wildfires, and ahead of Climate Week, a conference run by international nonprofit the Climate Group, in association with the United Nations and the city of New York.
"Our goal is to help people get authoritative information about climate change, and we are taking it seriously," Facebook chief product officer Chris Cox told USA TODAY. "This is one step, and there will be many more."
But climate scientists and environmental groups say the new effort does too little to rein in climate-change falsehoods and conspiracy theories.
For years, Facebook has allowed forces that reject climate science to pushed false, misleading or disputed information on the platform, such as the discredited theory that the government is using "chemtrails" to manipulate the weather, they said.
"The consequences are that the public is far less informed about climate change than they need to be," Michael E. Mann, director of Penn State University's Earth System Science Center, told USA TODAY. "It is very convenient for polluting interests who don't want to see climate policies move forward."
Mann says all social media companies must do more to combat rampant climate change misinformation and disinformation on social media, but he singled out Facebook.
"Facebook is particularly problematic as they have taken very few steps to deal with it, making it easy for bad actors to promote misinformation," he said.
Friends of the Earth, the Sierra Club, Greenpeace and other environmental organizations also accused Facebook of taking "half measures" to crack down on climate science misinformation.
"This new policy is a small step forward but does not address the larger climate disinformation crisis hiding in plain sight," the groups said in a joint statement.
If anything, the success of Facebook's COVID-19 Information Center which has directed more than 2 billion people to information from health authorities shows that the company has not been limited by technology but by a lack of will, according to John Cook, a research assistant professor at the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University.
"At best, they have been slow to react to climate misinformation," Cook said in an email. "At worst, they have actively reversed fact-checking efforts by climate experts, consciously enabling climate denial organizations to continue to publish their misinformation."
Distrust from the climate science community grew in September 2019 when the C02 Coalition, which claims that carbon dioxide from humans is beneficial for the planet, succeeded in getting a fact-check removed from a post that Facebook then labeled as "opinion."
Cox says Facebook roots out misinformation, working with 70 independent fact-checking organizations to identify and reduce the reach of falsehoods about climate change.
Now, when bogus claims threaten public safety, such as rumors that Oregon wildfires were being set by the far-right group the Proud Boys or leftist activists known as antifa, Facebook takes down these posts, Cox said.
"We are very aggressively removing content that could lead folks into harm's way, and we are surfacing more content that can get them the help and support that they need," he said. "During any weather-related or disaster-like event, we have teams pay a lot closer attention to what's going on in those areas to understand what's happening to the information ecosystem. And that's just part of the work we do to make sure the platform is providing the right information in times of crisis."
The Climate Science Information Center began appearing at the top of news feeds Tuesday. It aims to offer  authoritative information on climate change internationally and in users' backyards, plus tips on what users can do to help fight climate change.
It also will encourage Facebook users to join the #OurPlanetChallenge to show their communities what they're doing to help the environment, and to nominate friends and family to do the same. When 100,000 people join the challenge, Facebook will donate $100,000 to the Arbor Day Foundation.

Obama to speak 'frankly' on 11-day climate change tour

President Obama will log more than 14,000 miles on Air Force One over the next 11 days in a tour on climate change  that will take him from the desert West to the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Circle.
In Las Vegas, New Orleans and in the small Alaska fishing village of Kotzebue, Obama will deliver a three-pronged message: The U.S. needs to increase the use of alternative energy sources, make coastal communities more resilient and urge a global response to climate change.
The three major climate-themed events are part of an  effort by Obama to speak "frequently and frankly" about the issue over his second term, said Brian Deese, a senior Obama adviser who handles environmental and energy issues for the White House.
They come three weeks after the White House launched a plan for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 32% over 25 years.
In Las Vegas on Monday night, Obama was likely  to tout new executive actions to make alternative energy sources more affordable in a speech to the National Clean Energy Summit. On Monday, the Department of Energy announced it would issue $1billion in loan guarantees for "distributed energy" projects -- technologies that allow consumers to generate their own electricity or obtain it from a nearby source.
The idea, officials said, was not just to invest in new technologies, but to make it easier for those technologies to get a foothold in the market. For example, the Federal Housing Administration announced a policy Monday that will allow the buyer of an energy-efficient home to assume the cost of those improvements through assessments using a federal mortgage.
In New Orleans on Thursday, Obama will mark the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. And while climate change won't be the sole focus of the trip, Obama is expected to talk about the need to rebuild from disasters in ways that make communities more resistant to the effects of rising seas, more frequent storms, deeper droughts and increased wildfires.
"We've all tremendously increased our focus on how we build our modern infrastructure to be more resilient to all kinds of risks, including that of extreme weather," Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said.
In a three-day trip to Alaska next week, Obama will crisscross the state, visiting the villages of Seward, Dellingham and Kotzebue to meet with local communities -- including Alaska Natives -- about the effect that melting glaciers and softening permafrost are having.
His visit to Kotzebue, a largely Inupiat native village 33 miles above the Arctic Circle on the edge of the Chukchi Sea, will mark the northernmost trek of any sitting president of the United States.
"I'm going because Alaskans are on the front lines of one of the greatest challenges we face this century: climate change," Obama said in a video released by the White House.
"It's our wake-up call. The alarm bells are ringing, and as long as I'm president, America will lead the world to meet this threat before it's too late."
He'll address the State Department's Conference on Global Leadership in the Arctic, also known as the Glacier Conference, which is bringing together leaders from Arctic nations to grapple with climate issues.
The Arctic trip also highlights some of the tensions in Obama's energy policy. Environmental groups have been sharply critical of the Interior Department's granting of permits to Royal Dutch Shell to drill for oil in the Arctic Ocean, with the final permit coming last week.
Deese brushed off that criticism Monday, saying Shell was operating under a lease granted under the George W. Bush administration, and the Obama administration had delayed and narrowed the permit, allowing a single well with "unprecedented, high levels of safety standards for Shell or any other company to meet."

California is bracing for another fire threat; Windy conditions could prompt cuts in customer power

SAN FRANCISCO - Dry, windy weather posed an extreme wildfire risk Wednesday in Northern California, where massive blazes have destroyed hundreds of homes and killed or injured dozens of people.
The National Weather Service issued a red-flag warning for extreme fire danger from 5 a.m. through Friday morning. Amid bone-dry conditions and wind gusts possibly hitting 55 mph, Pacific Gas & Electric warned that it might cut power to as many as 54,000 customers in 24 counties.
The dangerous weather conditions developed after most of the huge fires that erupted over the past eight weeks have been fully or significantly contained and skies once stained orange were blue again.
Preemptive electricity cuts are a strategy aimed at preventing fires from being started by power lines that have been damaged or knocked down by high winds. "We really view it as a last resort option," said Mark Quinlan, PG&E's incident commander.
The utility deployed generators to keep electricity flowing in areas that might lose power, Quinlan said.
About 200 people in Humboldt County in the far northern part of the state could lose power Thursday afternoon as winds affect that area, PG&E said.
All power should be restored by late Friday night, the utility said.
The outages would include regions hit by massive wildfires. The Glass Fire that ravaged the wine country of Napa and Sonoma counties was nearly surrounded after destroying more than 1,500 homes and other buildings.
PG&E said it could cut power to more than 9,200 customers in Napa and about 1,800 in Sonoma.
Farther north, the Zogg Fire in Shasta and Tehama counties was 99% contained. Four people died in that blaze. PG&E said its cuts could affect nearly 4,700 customers in Shasta and about 1,200 in Tehama.
More than 8,500 wildfires have burned more than 6,406 square miles in California since the start of the year - mostly since mid-August. Thirty-one people died, and more than 9,200 buildings were destroyed.
Studies have linked bigger wildfires in America to climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Scientists said climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable.
PG&E said last month that it would shorten power shutoffs after receiving widespread criticism last year when it turned off electricity to 2 million people to prevent its equipment from sparking wildfires.
PG&E's aging equipment has sparked some of the state's largest wildfires, including the fire that destroyed much of the town of Paradise and killed 85 in 2018.
The utility pleaded guilty in June to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter; one death was ruled a suicide. The utility paid $25.5 billion in settlements to cover the losses from power-line-sparked catastrophes.
Wildfires will remain a threat in California indefinitely.
"We have had a historic fire season this year," PG&E meteorologist Scott Strenfel said. "We are and will continue to be in the peak of fire season until the rain and snow returns. And all of us here hope that it returns sooner rather than later."

Most endangered 2020 US river; Climate change leaves Upper Mississippi in peril

The Upper Mississippi River is the nation's "most endangered river" of 2020, according to a report released Tuesday by the environmental advocacy group American Rivers.
According to the group, "the Upper Mississippi River is critical to the nation's economy and is a globally significant ecosystem. However, climate change is driving more intense rain storms, leading to more frequent and prolonged flooding in the Upper Midwest. This new reality puts people, habitat and infrastructure at risk - and communities along the upper Mississippi are dangerously unprepared."
The rivers on the list aren't the nation's "worst" or most polluted rivers. According to American Rivers, three factors put rivers on the list:
The magnitude of the threat.
The significance of the river to people and nature.
A critical decision point in the coming year.
"There is no environmental threat of greater magnitude today than climate change, the key factor affecting the fates of the Upper Mississippi, the Lower Missouri and the Big Sunflower River (in Mississippi), the number one, two, and three rivers on the 2020 list," American Rivers said.
"Mixing poor river management with climate change has created a recipe for disaster," Bob Irvin, president and CEO of American Rivers, said in a statement. "Lives, businesses and property are at risk. It's time for our leaders to prioritize solutions that protect rivers and strengthen communities. Our health and safety depend on it."
Flooding threatens upper Mississippi and lower Missouri communities right now. Federal forecasters from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predict major or moderate floods in 23 states through the end of May.
Flooding during the coronavirus outbreak would create unprecedented risks for public health and safety, according to American Rivers.
As the coronavirus rages, does this list really matter?
American Rivers said yes: "We need clean water and healthy rivers more than ever now. Rivers provide the clean water that is absolutely vital to combat infectious disease; they keep our bodies hydrated, our hands and surfaces at home and in the workplace clean and disinfected.
"In a time of social distancing and the lonely disconnection it fosters, rivers can provide solace and nourish the spirit, even if it's only the daydream of a walk along the banks with a loved one, the perfect cast or the ideal trim of a kayak."
Over the years, publicity about the top 10 list has helped spur many successes, including the removal of outdated dams and the prevention of harmful development and pollution.
In addition to the 10 most troubled rivers, American Rivers named the Delaware River as the "River of the Year." The title celebrates the progress in cleaning up the river, which the group called "an extraordinary example of restoration."
American Rivers has compiled an annual list of the nation's most endangered rivers since 1984; the latest:
Upper Mississippi River (Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin)
Lower Missouri River (Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas)
Big Sunflower River (Mississippi)
Puyallup River (Washington)
South Fork Salmon River (Idaho)
Menominee River (Michigan, Wisconsin)
Rapid Creek (South Dakota)
Okefenokee Swamp (Georgia, Florida)
Ocklawaha River (Florida)
Lower Youghiogheny River (Pennsylvania)

Cities combat climate change; 'Adaptation' is name of game in fighting adverse effects

In Chula Vista, Calif., new waterfront buildings will be required to have higher foundations because of an expected rise in sea levels.
In Chicago, where flooding is predicted to worsen, residents can get rebates for putting rain barrels, compost bins and native plants in their yards.
And in New York City, where rising tides are also projected, wastewater treatment plants will elevate their pumps.
While some members of Congress debate the scientific validity of climate change, these U.S. cities are going beyond efforts to mitigate it with lower greenhouse gas emissions. They're at the forefront of an emerging trend: adaptation.
"It's a new field," says Brian Holland, director of climate programs at ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability USA. His association launched a Climate Resilient Communities program last year to help cities study effects of climate change and finance ways to adapt.  Nearly 600 local governments, representing one-fourth of the U.S. population, have signed on.
As extreme weather continues to sweep the nation and Americans struggle to deal with heat waves and flooding, Holland says many are convinced they need to act. "We're already seeing consequences of climate change," he says, "and those will only intensify."
An increasing number of cities have begun vulnerability assessments, and some -- notably Chicago -- are already taking steps to counter adverse effects.
"We're mostly at the study and planning phase," says Michelle Mehta, co-author of the "Thirsty for Answers" report this month by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), which looks at how a dozen U.S. cities will be affected.
The NRDC report says coastal cities such as New York and San Francisco anticipate "serious challenges" from sea-level rise, while Southwestern cities such as Phoenix will face water shortages and Midwestern cities, including Chicago and St. Louis, can expect more intense storms and flooding.
Climate change skeptic David Kreutzer, a research fellow in energy economics at the conservative Heritage Foundation, says there have always been "variations in weather" so it makes sense to prepare for storms. But he says cities may waste money if their regulations are based on "hysterical" projections of sea-level rise.
Scott Huth, public works director for Coronado, Calif., a beach town of 25,000,   says the planning is  not about politics or being liberal or conservative, it's simply about taking seriously "our duty to make sure that we're informed for things that might potentially happen."
Mehta says some projects meet immediate needs but will also help cities cope with problems exacerbated by climate change. Among them are elevating homes and rebuilding levees in New Orleans, which is steadily sinking. Other projects are more tailored to climate change:
Seattle has developed a climate tool,  now being tested, that allows users to input variables such as the location and timing of a proposed project to learn how it will be affected.
San Francisco plans next year to build devices in three locations to prevent salty bay water from overflowing into the city's combined storm-water and wastewater system. Rising sea levels already cause four to seven overflows each year that harm water treatment, says David Behar of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. "We expect a nuisance will become a problem," he says, adding: "Sea-level rise is inexorable."
Chicago is planting trees and replacing impervious surfaces such as concrete sidewalks with permeable materials to allow rain to seep into the ground. It has more than 600 green roof projects completed or underway.  "We're making the city resilient to climate changes right away," says Karen Weigert, the city's chief sustainability officer.
Chula Vista approved a climate plan in May that calls for more shade trees and "cool" or reflective roofs. Citing a study that sea levels -- already up 6 inches since 1900 -- will rise 12 to 18 inches more in the next 40 years, it also requires  that new waterfront projects account for this projected increase.
Norfolk, Va., is doing a feasibility study on measures such as dam structures to deal with the area's 14.5-inch rise in sea level over the past 80 years -- whatever the cause. "The city is trying to be as proactive as possible without engaging in the hyperbole of climate change arguments," says John White, the city's engineer for storm-water systems.
New York City is not only planting a million trees, it also has a $1.5 billion, 20-year plan for green infrastructure to help manage storm-water runoff from increasingly powerful storms.
Financing such projects is a challenge now for local governments, but not all needed changes require extra cash, says David Bragdon, director of long-term planning and sustainability for New York City.
"It's altering the way we're doing things," he says. "It's building something to fit the likely conditions of the future."

For them, climate change summit is God's work; Religious groups are active players in debate

COPENHAGEN -- Sunday started like any other day for Sister Joan Brown -- with a period of prayer and meditation just before dawn at her home in Albuquerque.
Then, instead of going to Mass, the Franciscan sister boarded a plane to Copenhagen. When she arrives today, she'll join 20,000 other attendees at a United Nations summit on climate change, where she hopes to persuade leaders including President Obama to reach a worldwide agreement to cut pollution levels.
"Many people can't afford to make this trip," says Brown, who is using frequent-flier miles and staying with a Danish family to cut costs. "But all our voices are needed, and this is one small way I can speak to the greatest moral and spiritual issue of our time."
She will be among numerous preachers, rabbis, ministers and other faith-based figures who are bringing a spiritual presence -- and, often, a strong point of view on the political issues -- to Copenhagen. At a time when political leaders are struggling to pass environmental legislation in the USA and elsewhere, in large part because of the potential economic costs, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon says religious leaders "can have the largest, widest and deepest reach" when it comes to influencing the outcome of the summit.
The main goal in Copenhagen is to forge a long-range global deal to cut emissions of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide, which climate data suggest is causing the Earth to warm. Representatives of 192 countries will attend, including Obama, who plans to arrive next week.
So how does Brown, an ecology minister in  the Archdiocese of Santa Fe, plan to make her voice stand out? For starters, she and a crowd of supporters held a candlelight vigil before her departure and wrote letters to New Mexico's U.S. senators, expressing concern over climate change.
Once she's in Copenhagen, she'll blog. And she'll do her best to navigate the dizzying two weeks of conferences, side events, parties and concerts that will make Copenhagen seem almost like the Woodstock of the environmental movement.
"I'm going to speak the truth to the delegates there, and try to educate people back here," she says. "It's our obligation for posterity to leave a world that exudes the beauty of the Creator for future generations."
Other religious leaders in Copenhagen will include Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury and spiritual head of the Church of England and the worldwide Anglican Communion; Richard Cizik, a former vice president of the National Association of Evangelicals; Jim Ball, head of the Evangelical Environmental Network; South African cleric and Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu; and representatives from the National Council of Churches (NCC), which encompasses more than 100,000 Protestant, Anglican, Orthodox, Evangelical and other congregations with 45 million members across the USA.
In all, as many as 100 religiously affiliated representatives from the USA plan to attend the summit, estimates Tyler Edgar, assistant director for the environmental arm of the NCC. Worldwide, she says that number will likely run "in the hundreds."
There is a wide range of views among -- and within -- different faiths as to the fundamental questions in the environmental debate: to what extent climate change is occurring, whether human activity is responsible for it, and what, if anything, should be done as a result.
Some are actively pushing against Copenhagen's agenda.
E. Calvin Beisner, a founder of the Cornwall Alliance, a coalition of clergy, scientists and academics, says recent data show the human role in causing global warming is minimal or non-existent. Religious figures who say otherwise, without a full background in science and economics, "risk an abuse of their moral authority," Beisner says.
Edgar, who also is traveling to Copenhagen, sees things differently. Broadly speaking, America's religious communities have shed their long-standing suspicion of the environmental cause "as that hippie, tree-hugging thing," she says.
In the past three years or so, many have rallied behind the belief that "we are all called upon to protect God's creation and God's people" by acting to stop climate change, Edgar says.
It's unclear whether such lobbying will be able to overcome a rough couple of months for the green cause.
In Copenhagen, Obama plans to present a goal of cutting U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by about 17% compared with levels in 2005. But to make good on that target, he'll need the Senate to pass an energy bill next year over the objections of many Republicans, who say it could result in dramatically higher energy costs for businesses and consumers. The legislation has been stalled for months.
Then there's the "Climategate" controversy, in which hackers recently obtained and published e-mails exchanged among prominent scientists who say the Earth is warming. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., is seeking congressional hearings into whether the e-mails show the scientists deliberately censored opposing views, and manipulated data in order to exaggerate their claims.
If anyone can help move the debate, it's faith-based leaders, says Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.
"This is a very religious country. God the Creator still does better in polls than any politician," says Lieberman, who backs legislation to mandate lower carbon emissions.  He says he first began to embrace the environmental cause 20 years ago because of his own spiritual beliefs.
Lieberman, who is Jewish and has deep ties with evangelicals, says religious leaders and constituents could still help swing some Senate votes, especially among Republicans. "This helps put the issue in the broader context ... of exercising our responsibility to protect God's creation ... and that helps us," he says.
'A profound moral issue'
Ball, who arrives in Copenhagen on Friday, says he plans to spend most of his time "hanging out in the hallways" of the Bella Center conference hall, where international delegates will be negotiating a deal. He'll be looking to speak with senior Obama administration officials and members of Congress.
Ball's pet cause is a proposal for rich countries, including the USA, to send poorer countries money -- at least $10 billion a year will be needed, the U.N.'s Ban says. The funds would help the countries overhaul their economies to pollute less, and cope with possible consequences of climate change such as lower agricultural yields, or rising seas that could devastate island nations.
"Our role is to remind (politicians) that this is a profound moral issue, and that the basic moral teachings of religion apply to these environmental problems," Ball says.
Such talk is relatively new. It wasn't long ago that, broadly speaking, religious and environmental groups were at odds -- an echo of the age-old tension between religion and science, exacerbated by the Bill Clinton-era culture wars of the 1990s.
Fletcher Harper, executive director of GreenFaith, a New Jersey-based group, cites two recent turning points -- the 2006 release of An Inconvenient Truth, the environmental movie featuring former vice president Al Gore, and the devastating impact the previous year of Hurricane Katrina, which Gore and others argue was made more deadly by warmer ocean water.
"When religious communities see human beings, particularly poor human beings, getting whacked like that, it's a real wake-up call," Harper says. "People saw the humanitarian side of this issue in a way they'd never seen before."
The debate is playing out worldwide. Last month, Harper attended a summit called "Many Heavens, One Earth" at Britain's Windsor Castle that sought to rally global religious leaders ahead of Copenhagen. The conference brought together leaders from nine major faiths -- Bahai Faith, Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Shinto and Sikhism.
The power vested in those groups is enormous. Together, the world's churches and other faith groups control 7% to 8% of the world's habitable land, are involved in more than half of all schools, and hold more than 7% of global financial investments, according to the Alliance of Religions and Conservation, the British group that organized the Windsor conference.
That explains why religious groups are uniquely positioned to not only influence the political debate, but also be an active part of environmental solutions, says Olav Kjorven, an assistant secretary-general at the U.N. who was at Windsor. He says religious institutions can use their influence to promote investment in industries that emit less carbon, support education on environmental issues in schools, and make places of worship more environmentally friendly.
"We hope to spread that message to Copenhagen," Kjorven says. "The faiths are ready to move on these issues."
Concerns about cost
There are others in the religious community who believe the proposals on the table at Copenhagen would hurt, rather than help, the world's poor.
Beisner, a theologian, says "efforts to control future temperatures by reduced use of fossil fuels would cost trillions of dollars, condemning future generations in poor countries to abject poverty."
Sen. Inhofe says that efforts to bring churches into the "liberal environmental lobby" are failing, at least in his home state.
"I can't find one pastor of an evangelical church who isn't fired up on my side of the issue," Inhofe says.
Indeed, recent polls suggest some of the public urgency on the issue is fading. A survey completed in October -- before the "Climategate" scandal broke -- by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press found that 65% of Americans believe that global warming is a "serious" or "very serious" issue, down from 73% in April 2008.
That's still a majority, says Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech University and co-author of A Climate for Change, which examines the global warming debate, and potential solutions, from a faith-based perspective. She says a better understanding of science has compelled senior religious leaders to join the environmental cause, even if some within their own congregations remain unconvinced.
"If you look at the heads of all major denominations -- even Southern Baptists -- you'll see that there's a real movement toward acknowledging the role that human activity is playing in climate change," she says.
Byron Johnson, director of the Institute for Studies of Religion at Baylor University, says there is evidence of a generational split on environmental issues among Evangelicals.
In a recent poll, his institute found that 73% of young Evangelicals agree with the statement that "Global climate change will have disastrous effects" -- compared with 59% of older Evangelicals.
That's no big surprise, Inhofe says. "These young ones, their entire lives, all they've heard is that global warming doctrine," he says, shaking his head.
"The schools are just filling their heads with this issue."
The political debate
Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., says he has been "touched" by the role that religious leaders are playing in the environmental debate -- and says they may help forge some kind of middle ground.
Brownback says he is not fully convinced that man-made climate change is occurring, but welcomes "prudent" steps recommended by some religious leaders to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
"I think their premise is right," Brownback says. "The question becomes: How do you tackle the issue?"
He ruled out passage of the energy bill that passed the House last spring, saying it would damage the economy -- a stance echoed by Inhofe and many other Senate Republicans.
Brownback says he prefers a focus on innovative technology that he says could be just as effective in reducing greenhouse gases.
The White House -- as well as governments in the European Union, China and much of the developing world -- says anti-pollution efforts will be insufficient unless they set firm targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Whatever happens, people of faith around the world will be watching closely, says Mary Dickey, a spokeswoman for Odyssey Networks, a media organization that is sending a three-person video crew to Copenhagen to cover religious implications of the debate.
"You wouldn't believe how passionate people are about this," Dickey says.
"Faith leaders are going to be a big part of the debate at Copenhagen, and beyond." 

Religious figures are weighing in
Since 2006, several religiously affiliated organizations and individuals have issued statements saying they believe man has an obligation to limit climate change.
They include:
*Pope Benedict XVI
*U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops
*Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians
* Rick Warren, evangelical pastor and author of The Purpose Driven Life
*Bishop Charles Blake, presiding bishop of the Church of God In Christ
*Jesse Miranda, president, AMEN (National Alliance of Evangelical Ministries)
* Frank Page, former president of the Southern Baptist Convention
*Royce Money, president, Abilene Christian University

We asked followers what they thought about Pope Francis weighing in on climate change.
The issue of climate change is of such importance that all support is needed. Efforts by President Obama are also very good.
@ZCarlander
The left will use the pope as a metaphorical club in the climate debate, but the real impact is a damaged, politicized papacy.
@ZanzibarBMcFate
It's not political. It's the future of our world. The politicians made it political pandering to their campaign donors.

In USA TODAY's article "With stroke of pen, pope could alter climate debate," Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum says the pope should stay out of the climate change debate. He says,  "We probably are better off leaving science to the scientists" (News, Monday).
If that's the case, Santorum and other Republicans need to follow his  advice. Scientists have spoken on the issue. The debate is really over.
Almost unanimously, climate scientists agree that climate change is occurring and that man is a contributing factor.
Leaders would serve us better by addressing this issue rather than denying it.

As temps rise, and ground thaws, Alaska slowly sinks; In many ways, the 'last frontier' is ground zero for climate change

Up the road from Santa Claus Lane, past the candy cane-striped streetlamps, Cathy Richard's backyard has a problem that not even elves -- or the big guy in red -- could fix.
The wood deck moves up and down, like a slow-motion sleigh. "You leave for work and when you come home, it can be 7 inches higher," says Richard, 36, a married bookkeeper and mom of three children.
She knows the Grinch involved. Her home in this Fairbanks suburb, built in 2007, sits on land that thaws and refreezes so the concrete pillars holding up her deck have crumbled. The front walkway and garage floor are also cracking, and the lumpy lawn has fissures.
Bad news for Richard -- and, for the rest of us. Warmer temperatures are thawing the surface layer of land that covers most of Alaska and is known as permafrost (frozen below for at least two years in a row.) This thawing not only damages roads, buildings and airport runways, but also releases vast amounts of greenhouse gases that further warm the atmosphere -- not just over Richard's house but worldwide.
The nation's last frontier is -- in many ways -- its ground zero for climate change. Alaska's temperatures are rising twice as fast as those in the lower 48, prompting more sea ice to disappear in summer. While this may eventually open the Northwest Passage to sought-after tourism, oil exploration and trade, it also spells trouble as wildfires increase, roads buckle and tribal villages sink into the sea.
USA TODAY traveled to the Fairbanks area, where workers were busy insulating thaw-damaged roads this summer amid a record number of 80-degree (or hotter) days, as the eighth stop in a year-long series to explore how climate change is changing lives.
The pace of permafrost thawing is "accelerating," says Vladimir Romanovsky, who runs the University of Alaska's Permafrost Laboratory in Fairbanks. He expects widespread degradation will start in a decade or two. By mid-century, his models suggest, permafrost could thaw in at least a third of Alaska and by 2100, in two-thirds of the state.
"This rapid thawing is unprecedented" and is largely due to fossil-fuel emissions, says Kevin Schaefer of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo. He says it's already emitting its own heat-trapping carbon dioxide and methane, but the amount will skyrocket in the next 20 to 30 years. "Once the emissions start, they can't be turned off."
Telltale signs are common -- from huge potholes in parking lots to collapsed hill slopes and leaning trees in what are called "drunken forests" in Denali National Park, home of the majestic Mount McKinley -- North America's tallest peak.
"You can see and hear the ice melting," says Ted Schuur, a permafrost expert at the University of Florida who's doing field studies in central Alaska. He says permafrost contains soil and plant matter as well as chunks of ice as big as cars. When the ice melts, the ground sinks.
He's seen it with his own cabin near Fairbanks, which was listing until he leveled one side with adjustable foundation piers.
Ruth Macchione, an 84-year-old grandmother in Fairbanks, has also witnessed the damage.
She and her late husband raised nine children in a home he built more than 50 years ago with logs that he sanded and polished. He lived there until his death in 1986 and she stayed until 2000, when she was forced to move to a small new house next door.
"Everything's tilted," she says, gazing at the old family home that is sinking into the ground. For years, she put furniture and other items on blocks to try to level them, but it got to the point where she could no longer open or close the doors.
"It's a shame," she says sadly of her partly submerged homestead. "It was well-built."
'Like burning fossil fuel'
Permafrost has existed for eons. During the last Ice Age, it swept as far south as Missouri and Illinois. Today, most of it is  in Russia and Canada, but the United States accounts for 6% of the world's total -- almost all of which exists in Alaska.
It has a top "active" layer that thaws and refreezes each year and a deeper layer that remains frozen and stores organic carbon from decaying plants and animals -- possibly twice as much carbon as in the atmosphere.
As air temperatures rise, the top layer thickens and more thawing occurs; its pace depends on local conditions. Some areas such as Fairbanks are particularly vulnerable, because the ground temperature now hovers near the thaw point so the permafrost is less stable and thaws less evenly.
The perils of permafrost have long been known. Back in the early 1970s, government scientists insisted that parts of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline be built above ground with refrigerated supports. The pipeline's oil is hot and, if buried underground in permafrost, could help thaw the top layer and cause potential spills.
Yet scientists have just begun in the past five to 10 years to figure out how much carbon is stored in the permafrost and what its accelerated thawing will mean for climate change -- and vice versa.
"It's like burning fossil fuels," says Schaefer. He and other permafrost experts have varying estimates on how much carbon dioxide and methane will be released into the atmosphere from thawing. Yet they agree climate change is exacerbating the problem and creating a "feedback loop" or vicious cycle in which thawing then exacerbates global warming.
"We're on the edge of a major transition point," Schuur says, pointing to a 2013 report he authored that found tundras worldwide may already be emitting more carbon than they absorb. He says global permafrost emissions will be significant -- akin to those from current deforestation -- but probably much less than those from power plants, cars and other burning of oil and gas.
These emissions weren't included in the global warming estimates developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and released in September as the first part of its Fifth Assessment Report.
The report, which said with heightened certainty that humans are responsible for the planet's rising temperatures, serves as a basis for negotiating future climate treaties.
Many Alaskans are skeptical about the climate link.
"Permafrost has been thawing since the last Ice Age," says Jeff Curley, an engineer for the Alaska Department of Transportation, saying its amount depends on naturally-occurring variability. He notes the state's temperatures have fluctuated every 30 or so years.
"When I'm in Alaska, I stop talking about climate change," Schuur says, adding the term has become politically charged. Still, he says Alaskans are deeply concerned about permafrost changes.
"In our region, roads affected by permafrost thawing are very common," Curley says. "There are places around Fairbanks where there's asphalt 10 feet thick, because they were filled in to keep leveling off the road on an annual basis."
Sea ice loss poses problems
Permafrost isn't Alaska's only climate problem. As its temperatures rise (up 3.4 degrees Fahrenheit year-round in the past 60 years and 6 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter), there's not enough rain to offset the higher amount of evaporation, so surface soils dry up -- a drying amplified by thawing permafrost. The result? Increased risk of wildfires.
"All climate impacts are connected to each other," says Sarah Trainor, who directs the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy at the University of Alaska, noting the state has had more large wildfires in the past two decades than in the prior 40 years.
Declining sea ice creates another vicious cycle. Most of the world's sea ice is in the Arctic, and since it reflects sunlight (seawater absorbs it), its loss will accelerate northern warming. And, in turn, higher temperature will melt more ice.
This has happened dramatically in the past 30 years, according to measurements in September, when the extent of sea ice reaches its annual low after a summer of heat. Arctic sea ice hit an all-time low in Sept. 2012 but recovered somewhat last month.
"We could be looking at summers with essentially no sea ice on the Arctic Ocean only a few decades from now," Mark Serreze, director of the University of Colorado-Boulder's National Snow and Ice Data Center, said in announcing its 2013 satellite measurements.
The loss of sea ice offers tantalizing trade opportunities, because it could make the Northwest Passage navigable more often in summer. This sea route across the Arctic Ocean hugs Alaska's coast and can now be crossed only about every seven summers. Sought by explorers for centuries as a short-cut between Europe and Asia, it could be about 50% fewer nautical miles than a trip via the Panama Canal.
Yet while the loss of sea ice could open coastal Alaska to more oil exploration, tourism and shipping, it's not likely to help native Alaskans, says Laurence Smith, a geography professor at the University of California-Los Angeles.
He says melting ice may open up the sea but close off the land. Because much of Alaska is traversed in winter by ice -- rather than paved -- roads, he says its interior will become less accessible.
"We're more likely to see an abandonment of these northern landscapes," says Smith, author of The World in 2050: Four Forces Shaping Civilization's Northern Future.
Schuur sees sea ice loss as a huge problem but worries more about permafrost, because the latter is not as well monitored. "It's a sleeping giant that affects us all."

California restaurants add climate change tax; Money goes to farmers to help them reduce carbon dioxide

Eating out is already getting more expensive, as restaurants nationwide raise prices to cover rising rents and employee costs.
Now, some California diners will get hit with a climate change tax.
Spurred by a Bay Area restaurateur, eateries across the state will have the option this fall of joining the Restore California Renewable Restaurant program, which adds 1% to the bill.
The program is optional for restaurants and consumers alike. Funds from the initiative go to help farmers make changes in their fields that would help capture carbon dioxide. CO2 is considered  among the chief contributors to climate change.
"Across the country, restaurants are an $800 billion business and represent 1 in 10 U.S. workers, which is too much money and people to not be part of the solution," says Anthony Myint, co-founder of Mission Chinese, a local restaurant that has been adding an optional 3% surcharge to its bills since last summer.
The new initiative comes against a backdrop of rising dining prices. In January, full-service restaurant prices were up 2.7 percent from a year earlier, well above the 1.6 percent annual rise for inflation overall, according to the consumer price index.
But Myint is convinced adding a few cents to a bill for a good cause won't make customers balk.
"Since we started adding 3% last summer, zero people have opted out," he says.
The genesis of the new tax is Myint's deep passion for combining entrepreneurship with social activism. A few years ago, he started the Perennial Farming Initiative, a non-profit aimed at helping restaurant owners go carbon neutral -- which means finding ways to offset the carbon dioxide produced by a business by investing in enterprises that take CO2 out of the atmosphere.
So far, 25 restaurants globally have signed on to the initiative's so-called Zero Foodprint pledge. On a $50 check, a 3% surcharge would be $1.50, and a 1% charge is 50 cents.
California has long been on the forefront of ecological issues, from land conservation to early solar power adoption. State leaders, including Gov. Gavin Newsom, have vowed to make the state carbon neutral by 2045.
For restaurant owners, the easiest way to help with carbon sequestration is to help farmers adopt measures, often initially costly, to make their fields retain rather than emit carbon. These include adding compost to improve soil health, planting cover crops in between cash crops, and planting hedgerows with woody plants that store carbon in their roots.
"Ingredients represent 65% of where an average restaurant's carbon footprint lies," Myint says. "So you have to look carefully at how the ingredients you use are produced."
Myint's local effort went statewide after he connected with officials from the California Air Resources Board and the California Department of Food and Agriculture during a Global Action Climate Summit here last September.
"Anthony wanted to provide even more confidence to his customers around where this surcharge was going, so he approached CARB and us about a collaboration," says Karen Ross, secretary of the state's Department of Food and Agriculture.
"The state uses its expertise around carbon sequestration farming practices we've vetted, to do that accounting and add transparency.
"This could maybe serve as a model for other businesses and investors to use their buying power to do similar things."
To receive a government cap and trade grant, farmers can apply directly for funds in exchange for committing to actions that include upgrading old farming equipment and installing renewable energy power options.
In contrast, the new 1% climate change tax would give restaurant owners the ability to distribute the funds directly to growers that they work with for their produce.
Myiant, who also has Mission Chinese locations in New York, says that if 1% of California's nearly 100,000 restaurants were to successfully adopt the new climate change surcharge,  $10 million a year would be raised.
Those funds would supplement a variety of existing California programs that farmers can avail themselves of when trying to improve the health of their soil, says Renata Brillinger, executive director of CalCAN, the California Climate & Agriculture Network, a coalition of sustainable agriculture organizations.
"Over the last 50 years, farms moved toward the chemical management of their fields, which resulted in a series of air, water and climate problems," Brillinger says.
"But now, we here in California, and in other parts of the country, are seeing consumer taking more interest in where their food comes from and how it's grown. Restaurants are driven often by consumer trends, so this new optional tax should appeal."
Just how the state's restaurants will react remains to be seen.
"It's too early days," says Sharokina Shams, vice president of public affairs for the California Restaurant Association.
"These days, bill surcharges are nothing new, whether its to help with employee pay and benefits or for a cause like the wildfires. So this seems like a group of well-intentioned people finding another way to use a surcharge.
"California restaurants ring up 10 million transactions a day, so working through them can be an effective way to raise consumer awareness."

Climate change linked to suicides; Study suggests rates could rise with temps

Rising temperatures linked to human-caused climate change could lead to increasing suicide rates in the United States and Mexico, a study suggested Monday.
By comparing historical temperature and suicide data going back decades, researchers found a strong correlation between warm weather and increased suicides, according to a report published in Nature Climate Change, a peer-reviewed British journal.
Researchers have known for centuries that conflict and violence tend to peak during warmer months.
"Now we see that in addition to hurting others, some individuals hurt themselves," said Solomon Hsiang, study co-author from the University of California-Berkeley. "It appears that heat profoundly affects the human mind and how we decide to inflict harm."
The study found climate change could lead to 9,000 to 44,000 additional suicides across the United States and Mexico by 2050.
"This may be the first decisive evidence that climate change will have a substantial effect on mental health in the United States and Mexico, with tragic human costs," Hsiang said.
The study found suicide rates increase 0.7 percent in U.S. counties for each 1.8-degree  increase in monthly average temperature.
"The thousands of additional suicides that are likely to occur as a result of unmitigated climate change are not just a number, they represent tragic losses for families across the country," said lead author Marshall Burke of Stanford University.
In the United States, suicides claim nearly 45,000 lives a year, twice the number of homicides, and they are the 10th-leading cause of death. Suicide rates in the U.S. have risen nearly 30percent since 1999, according to a report in June from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Globally, about 800,000 people die as a result of suicide every year, the World Health Organization said.
"Suicide is one of the leading causes of death globally, and suicide rates in the U.S. have risen dramatically over the last 15 years," Burke said. "So better understanding the causes of suicide is a public health priority."
Mental health experts caution other factors should be considered when studying suicide rates.
Medication, prescription costs and  the economy are key parts of the equation, said Daniel  Reidenberg, executive director of Suicide Awareness Voices of Education, a non-profit organization.
"If in fact suicide rates were truly corresponding to the temperature, would that suggest that we keep people who are suicidal in cooler climates or temperature-controlled settings, and that would reduce the risk of their death?" Reidenberg said.
Study co-author Burke said hotter temperatures are "clearly not the only, nor the most important, risk factor for suicide."
"But our findings suggest that warming can have a surprisingly large impact on suicide risk, and this matters for both our understanding of mental health as well as for what we should expect as temperatures continue to warm," he said.
The  past three years have been the globe's hottest on record, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said, just as carbon dioxide levels are at their highest in 800,000 years.
A study last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that "warming temperature trends over the last three decades have already been responsible for over 59,000 suicides throughout India."
Looking at social media, the authors found higher monthly temperatures also were associated with an increased use of "depressive language" on Twitter. Looking at more than a half-billion Twitter posts, they found that tweets contain language such as "lonely," "trapped" or "suicidal" more often during hot spells.
Daniel J. Reidenberg, executive director of Suicide Awareness Voices of Education, a non-profit organization dedicated to preventing suicide, raised some red flags about the study. He said  the authors should have considered other variables such as medication, prescription costs and economic factors.

Climate change could foul up precipitation; Study warns of redistributed rain around the world

Last month alone, climate change was blamed for sleepless nights and trees moving west. Now there's a new problem: weird rainfall.
A study in the journal Science Advances suggests climate change will alter where rain falls around the world, making wet areas wetter and dry areas drier, especially in the summer.
The world's rainiest areas may push north during the winter, said study lead author Aaron Putnam, a glacial geologist at the University of Maine. The redistribution of rainfall is worrisome, he said, as it would affect water availability for people around the world.
The shift isn't unprecedented: It's happened before, but that was because of natural climate change.
Researchers studied ancient climate history to see how a warming climate changed rainfall patterns. About 14,600 years ago, a shift in temperature changed where precipitation fell over the entire planet, much like the predicted effect of man-made global warming over the next few decades.
Global warming occurs when heat-trapping carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are emitted into the air by burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels, which boosts world temperatures to levels that scientists say cannot be explained by natural factors.
The study "adds to the large body of evidence that climate change is going to mess with the large-scale motions of air and water in the atmosphere," NASA climate scientist Kate Marvel, who wasn't involved with the study, told Wisconsin's Beloit Daily News. "And this matters, because those patterns largely determine where it's rainy or arid, broadly speaking,"
According to NASA, rising temperatures will intensify the Earth's water cycle, increasing evaporation. This increased evaporation will result in more storms but also contribute to drying over some land areas.
As a result, storm-affected areas are likely to experience increases in precipitation and increased risk of flooding, while areas far away from storm tracks are likely to experience less precipitation and an increased risk of drought.

Rising temperatures take increasingly deadly toll; Warming climate that helps drive them unlikely to leave any major US city untouched

Jack Esry died alone in his metro Phoenix home on July 25, 2019.
Phoenix and other fast-warming cities
The average temperature in Phoenix has increased by 4.35 degrees since 1970, according to a 2019 report by Climate Central. Cities including Burlington, Vermont; Chattanooga, Tennessee; and Helena, Montana, are right behind Phoenix as members in Climate Central's top 10 fast-warming cities list, experiencing temperature rises of more than 4 degrees.
As temperatures soared close to 110 degrees, his son Bill, who lived out of state, worried that his aging father, who had  been injured in a serious fall, would be affected by the extreme heat.
His dad's air-conditioning unit had failed and Jack had delayed getting it fixed. He kept his windows closed, fearful his cats would escape. Finally, a friend called Bill to say his dad had missed a weekly chat.
Bill called authorities and asked for a welfare check.
When police arrived, the house was a scorching 99 degrees inside.
Jack Esry had succumbed to the heat.
Esry, 80, was one of a record 197 people in Maricopa County who died from heat-related causes in 2019. That surpassed the previous record of 182 deaths in 2018, which surpassed the record of 179 deaths in 2017.
As of Tuesday, the Maricopa County Health Department has confirmed 106 heat-related deaths this year. The agency is investigating 234.
The death toll rises in a way that would drive dramatic headlines if tied to a single weather event. Hurricane landfalls typically claim far fewer lives.
Instead, heat deaths happen one at a time, over the growing number of weeks and months each year when the weather turns dangerous. They are tied not to a single event but to an ongoing one, the rising temperatures that affect all seasons.
Over the past 30 years, heat has accounted for more fatalities on average than any other weather-related disaster in the U.S., according to the National Weather Service.
And while heat deaths may be more acute in the desert city of Phoenix, the warming climate that helps drive them is not likely to leave any major American city unscathed.
Hot days, hot nights
In the undeveloped desert, temperatures fall when the sun goes down, but in Phoenix, the heat seems relentless.
More than once this summer in Phoenix, the official thermometer still read 100 degrees at midnight and for more than seven days in July, the temperature never dropped below 90 degrees, setting a new record.
The region also contends with longer summers as days grow hotter earlier, sometimes as soon as April, and stay hot well into October.
And summers won't grow more temperate any time soon. Climate change has increased the average temperature in Phoenix by 4.35 degrees since 1970, according to a 2019 report by Climate Central.
The expanding urban heat island hoards heat in asphalt, concrete and tall buildings during the day and releases it at night, which has resulted in nighttime temperatures soaring as much as 10 degrees above historical records.
These factors contributed to Phoenix's status in the report as the fourth fastest-warming city in the U.S. With an average of 169 days per year with temperatures of 90 degrees or higher and an average midsummer high temperature of 106.1 degrees, Phoenix was also ranked as the hottest big city in the U.S.
As if to underscore the trend, the average temperature in Phoenix during July was 98.9 degrees, which made July the hottest month on record. The record was broken 31 days later when August ended with an average temperature of 99.1 degrees. The summer was also the hottest ever recorded.
But it's not just desert cities like Phoenix that are threatened by hotter summer temperatures. Deadly heat is on the rise across the United States. Cities including Burlington, Vermont; Chattanooga, Tennessee; and Helena, Montana, are right behind Phoenix as members in Climate Central's top 10 fast-warming cities list, experiencing temperature rises of more than 4 degrees.
Chattanooga experienced what one meteorologist called a "death ridge" during a May 2019 heat wave. The city and surrounding region experienced record temperatures - Chattanooga's high temperature was more than 10 degrees above normal for late May. The Tennessee Valley city's summer temperatures stretched into fall, reaching 100 degrees in October for the first time since weather records have been kept.
Even Minneapolis, known as the coldest large city in the U.S., has seen a 3.72 degree temperature rise.
"We are seeing more intense and longer heat waves, and while everywhere is used to dealing with seasonal extreme heat events for their given city, many northern areas may not able to adapt fully to extended periods of heat the same way as the south," said Jennifer Vanos, professor of sustainability at Arizona State University.
"When heat combines with humidity over many days, like we see in much of the Great Lakes region," Vanos said, "it can become particularly dangerous."
As highs and lows continue their inexorable rise, long-running factors including poverty, homelessness and isolation for the elderly have begun to intersect with new effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may limit incomes and shutter the facilities that help some people escape the heat. The combined effects could lead to a higher death toll this year.
'Like being in a steam room'
As the air temperature rises, so does the body's temperature, said Mona Sarfaty, director of the Program on Climate and Health in the Center for Climate Change Communication. In response, a person begins to sweat.
"The sweat evaporates from the skin as long as the air isn't too humid," Sarfaty said. "So you would expect that sweat to evaporate and cool things. It's the body's way of cooling itself."
Without an opportunity to cool the body down, she said, people begin to feel the first symptoms of heat illness.
"You get headaches," Sarfaty said. "You may just start to feel kind of dizzy or lightheaded. You may have some cramping, either abdominal cramping or muscle cramping."
The longer someone is overheated, the worse the body's response. If a body's core temperature reaches 104 degrees or higher, the heart starts to pound and breathing speeds up. Eventually, the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver and brain will become damaged.
When that occurs, without immediate medical treatment, lifelong damage or death can occur within 24 hours.
'Like being in a steam room'
Rising humidity also factors into more dangerous summer days across the nation. The intersection of temperature and humidity can turn deadly with a thermometer reading as low as 100 degrees if the humidity rises to 35% or higher.
Weather and climate experts measure the effects of heat and humidity with what's called a heat index. Excessive heat warnings are issued when the heat index is expected to reach 105 or higher for at least two days, and nighttime temperatures will be 75 degrees or higher.
Colin Raymond, a researcher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said adding humidity into a hot day affects the body's ability to cool itself.
"It's like being in a steam room," Raymond said. Days of higher temperatures coupled with higher concentrations of water vapor in the air can cause people to fall ill in large numbers, although he said more research is underway to more fully understand the effects.
A report by the Union of Concerned Scientists said if warming proceeds without any action to reduce heat-trapping emissions, one-third of the nation's 481 urban areas with populations of more than 50,000 people will experience an average of 30 or more days per year with a heat index registering more than 105 degrees.
"We know that we are the hottest county in the U.S.," said Vanos, at ASU. "We're also the fastest-growing county in the U.S., so we should have the smartest policies and programs for reducing public health impacts that are associated with heat."
Vanos said existing programs don't seem to be effective at protecting the area's most vulnerable, like people who don't have air conditioning. Seniors and homeless people are also succumbing at increased rates. And transit riders in the metro area are greatly challenged as they deal with little shade and heat radiating off asphalt.
Too costly to stay cool
Summer in Phoenix typically starts with stifling heat with low humidity. Once the summer monsoon pattern sets in, that sense of being dry-roasted gives way to steamy, oppressive heat that is inescapable even at night.
Most people would rely more on their air-conditioners, but many low-income families don't have that luxury.
Tucked into a largely Latino neighborhood in south Phoenix, one family has struggled to keep cool yet not run out of money during the torrid summer monsoon.
Blanca Abarca, her husband and 14-year-old daughter, Isabella, lack the means to cool off that many people take for granted: air-conditioning. The Abarcas rely on a different technology - two evaporative coolers - in their  1950s-era brick home.
The coolers reduce air temperature by blowing water-charged air through the house. But a swamp cooler, as it's often called, becomes ineffective once the dew point, a combination of temperature and moisture in the air, reaches 55. Abarca's husband, a handyman, installed ventilators in the ceiling and floor to circulate more air, but during the monsoon, being indoors can be almost unbearable.
Abarca showed off her outdoor kitchen and dining area in a backyard alive with big shade trees, three dogs, several chickens, a vegetable garden shaded to keep the hot sun off her tender plants. The kitchen is essential when it's too hot to cook indoors, she said through an interpreter.
The Abarcas take at least three showers a day to cool off. And, Abarca said, "We drink about 6 or 7 gallons of water a week just to hydrate."
They purchased two tiny room air-conditioners for the bedrooms, but Abarca said they carefully ration their usage to just a few hours at night, so they can sleep.
"During the summers, we pay $200 a month at most," said Abarca, a stay-at-home mom. That's still a lot of money to a family with just one breadwinner.
"Some people pay $400 or $500 a month," she said. "One lady got a $1,500 bill, but even after talking to the company and finding there was a mistake, they still had to pay $600. Oh my gosh, I don't have that kind of money!
"My husband said that if we put an air-conditioner on the house, that he'd have to get another job," she said. "I see other families that finally got AC units, but now both parents have to work just to afford the electric bills."
Heat on the street
Nearly half of victims of heat-related or heat-caused illness in 2019 were homeless, with another 14 who likely lacked a place to call home but whose housing status wasn't clearly stated in medical examiner's reports.
Some of the victims had burns from lying on hot concrete or asphalt, while first responders reported body temperatures of up to 112 degrees in people who were still alive when they arrived at the scene.
Rebecca Legate counts herself lucky to not be such a statistic. In 2016, Legate was struggling to survive what, at the time, was the third-hottest year in Phoenix. Daytime temperatures reached as high as 118 degrees, and 19 days hit record high temperatures.
More dangerous were the 16 nights during that hellish summer when temperatures never dipped below 89 degrees. To add to her misery, Legate was pregnant.
After a traumatic experience that caused her to flash back to when she was trafficked as a child, Legate said she regressed from a long-term period of sobriety.
"I ended up living in a condemned house with no electricity, no water, in the middle of the summer, pregnant," she said. "I had three of my older kids with me at the time."
The heat also affects transit riders in Phoenix. Rosetta Walker, 60, has been using public transit for the past eight years as she pursues her post-retirement passion of volunteerism. She's unable to drive because diabetes-related glaucoma left her legally blind. She takes the bus and light rail to the federal courthouse every Friday to register new voters after the weekly naturalization ceremony.
She faces up to a 20-minute walk to a bus stop, depending on which direction she's heading that day. There's very little shade along the way and rarely any at the bus stops she frequents.
The city needs "more shade at the stops," she said. "The shade is welcome when it's 110 degrees out."
David Hondula, assistant professor at ASU's School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning, agrees that shade structures can make a difference to pedestrians in the summer. Hondula also notes that quality of life issues could be more closely explored to develop heat mitigation and adaptation.
"Is our ice cream not melting as we're walking home from the grocery store? Can people choose active modes of transportation like public transportation?" he said.
Beating the heat
Over the past several years, public and private agencies have begun to take a more coordinated approach to addressing what has become an invisible, slow-moving public health crisis.
One such approach is the Maricopa Coalition on Climate Change and Public Health. Since 2015, the coalition has worked to build a strategic plan to address the ever-growing issue of hotter summers and how to support those who are most vulnerable.
The coalition includes the Heat Relief Regional Network, a county-wide system of emergency cooling centers and water distribution sites. The cooling centers - at community centers, libraries and churches - operate on the hottest days. Many are located along bus routes, but some can only be accessed by walking several blocks.
The cooling centers have their limits. They close when the facility does, usually during the hottest part of the day.
Phoenix is looking at how to improve the cooling centers, said Mark Hartman, chief sustainability officer for the city.
"We want to ensure that our cooling centers are actually in places that people will want to go," Hartman said.
In December 2019, the Institute for Sustainable Communities, an organization that helps build resiliency and economic sustainability, received an environmental community action grant that it will use to help facilitate the coalition's implementation of its strategic plan.
"Maricopa County is more advanced compared to other regions in dealing with extreme heat," said Steve Adams, director of urban resilience at the institute. He said many programs to address climate change tend to operate at local jurisdictional levels; he likened such programs to how local governments respond to citizen calls to fix potholes in a pragmatic fashion.
One such public-private partnership is beginning to bear fruit, or, rather, mesquite beans. Tucked in the shadow of glittering new development in downtown Phoenix, the Edison-Eastlake neighborhood swelters during the summer.
ASU partnered with the Nature Conservancy, county and city agencies, and local residents to develop a plan to make this working-class neighborhood more walkable and less hazardous to health.
"Phoenix is one of the hottest areas around the world," said Diana Bermudez, director of special projects for the Nature Conservancy. "But this is one of the hottest areas in terms of temperature in Phoenix."
After holding workshops with residents, the coalition identified 12 "hot spots" that needed to be addressed. One such corner recently was the site of the first installation to relieve the heat: planting mesquite trees and other indigenous plants at the Trans Queer Pueblo on a corner in South Phoenix.
Jonathan Beebe Giudice with the Pueblo said not only will the trees and cactuses provide needed shade for pedestrians, they also symbolize a return to ancestral foods and show people in the community how they can continue to self-develop on their own terms.
"I think one of the things that is very important is that people feel that there is not much that they can do when it comes to heat," said Bermudez. "But the truth of the matter is that there are things that can be done, and that nature can play a very important role in that."

13 firms back plan for climate change; Apple, Walmart, GM among those offering support for Obama

The Obama administration recruited some big-name corporate help Monday to help push its climate change plans in the United States and across the globe.
Thirteen major companies -- from Alcoa to Walmart -- made anti-pollution commitments that mirror the president's plans and agreed to back the administration's efforts at climate change talks later this year.
"They're setting an example for their peers and their industries," White House senior adviser Brian Deese said.
In making what the White House calls the American Business Act on Climate Pledge, companies agree to reduce their carbon emissions and invest in more clean-energy alternatives, the White House said in a statement.
In addition to Alcoa and Walmart, other participants are Apple, Bank of America, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Cargill, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Goldman Sachs, Google, Microsoft, PepsiCo and UPS.
Their commitments add up to more than $140 billion in "new low-carbon investment" and more than 1,600 megawatts of new renewable energy, the White House said in a statement.
Company leaders met Monday at the White House with Secretary of State John Kerry and other administration officials.
The 13 companies also agreed to support the Obama administration as it seeks a global climate change deal later this year in Paris.
Republicans said it's fine for companies to explore energy alternatives voluntarily but that Obama's policies will put excessive burdens on small businesses. Cory Fritz, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said the private sector "creates growth, opportunities and environmental progress" better than any government.
Obama has pushed his climate change agenda through executive actions, including new restrictions on power plants, and with bilateral agreements. Last year, the United States and China announced a bilateral efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Overall, the administration's climate change plan "will cut nearly 6 billion tons of carbon pollution through 2030, an amount equivalent to taking all the cars in the United States off the road for more than four years," the White House said.

Experts postpone arguing climate change; Meteorologists want to have discussion -- once people are safe

While unknown numbers of people are dead, missing or displaced, writing about a potential link between a national tragedy such as Hurricane Harvey and man-made climate change is an understandably touchy subject.
"If you think appropriate time to do so is while floodwaters are continuing to rise, then that opportunism reflects your personal values," tweeted WeatherBell meteorologist Ryan Maue. "What we need right now is an informed, reasoned, intellectual debate on climate change and extreme events."
Another meteorologist, Marshall Shepherd of the University of Georgia, said he had concerns. "I am uncomfortable discussing as a human tragedy unfolds, but when the dust settles, the conversation needs to happen -- and a recent National Academies report on attribution is a good place to start. Attribution studies on Harvey will happen."
Climate change remains a polarizing issue in our divided country.
Whenever a huge weather event such as Harvey occurs, a debate rages in the meteorological community about whether it is appropriate to discuss potential links between climate change and that event.
The report that Shepherd referred to, which was released in 2016, said there is no evidence that the number of tropical cyclones (tropical storms, hurricanes and typhoons) has increased in recent decades as the planet has warmed.
There has been "marginally significant increases in the frequency of Category 4 and 5 storms."
Harvey was a Category 4 hurricane at landfall Friday night, the strongest storm to hit the USA in 12 years.
The report warned that "tropical cyclones are projected to become more intense as the climate warms."
Precipitation in tropical cyclones is likely to increase because of the increased water vapor content of the atmosphere, similarly to other extreme precipitation events, the report said.
The theory goes that a warmer atmosphere would make hurricanes more intense than they would otherwise be. "Climate change is making even heavier rainfall possible," noted John W. Nielsen-Gammon, a Texas A&M University meteorologist and the Texas State Climatologist.
Another expert, Adam Sobel of Columbia University, said that "based on many previous studies of extreme precipitation events, as well as our overall scientific understanding, it is plausible to expect that they (tropical cyclones) will show some amplification due to increased water vapor in a warmer atmosphere."
Sobel said Harvey would have been a huge disaster in Houston with or without global warming. This is because of the specific meteorological situation of Harvey (the positions of the high-pressure systems and the jet stream), and the location of a major city.
"There are ideas about how the meteorological situation could have been influenced by warming, but those are much less robust and well-understood, and at this point, I view it as a natural occurrence by default," Sobel said.

Obama to cut more carbon emissions; Climate change effort will face opposition

The Obama administration is set to announce steeper-than-expected cuts in carbon pollution from power plants, part of a stepped-up push to emphasize climate change in the weeks ahead.
The new Clean Power Plan -- certain to be challenged in the courts and in the Republican Congress -- will require power plants to reduce carbon emissions by 32% from 2005 levels between now and 2030.
That's a 9% increase from the rules as proposed a year ago, according to the White House.
In a video announcing the revamped plan, Obama called it "the biggest, most important step we've ever taken to combat climate change."
The revamped rules will be formally released Monday, Obama said.
The plan also calls for a faster transition to renewable energy sources by 2030.
Obama plans to sell this and other climate change plans in a series of high-profile events over the next several months.
He plans to address a National Clean Energy Summit in Nevada and will become the first president to visit the Arctic area of Alaska.
Climate change will also be a major topic when Obama meets with Pope Francis at the White House in September.
Later this year, Obama aides and government officials from other countries will negotiate the details of a global climate agreement.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other Republicans have said that Obama's proposed emission cuts are unrealistic and will slow business growth and job creation.
Members of the energy industry have  announced plans to sue over the new emission cut rules, saying the administration lacks the legal authority to impose them.
In his video, Obama said that climate change is causing hotter summers, rising sea levels, longer wildfires and more destructive extreme weather events, and is contributing to more asthma cases.
The administration has moved in previous years to limit greenhouse gas emission for cars, trucks and heavy-duty vehicles.
Yet, Obama said in the White House video, "existing power plants can still dump unlimited amounts of harmful carbon pollutants into the air we breathe."

Dissent dwindles on climate change

President Obama, Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan don't see eye to eye on a lot of things. But they don't differ on this: Humankind is warming the planet, and we need to do something about it.
As for climate scientists, it's not too much to say that virtually all of them are on board with the idea that man-made fossil fuels caused by burning coal, oil and gas are heating planet Earth.
It wasn't ever thus, this overwhelming feeling that those who would deny man's influence on rising temperatures are simply wrong and not part of the conversation, whether in the negotiating rooms at Le Bourget, where United Nations climate talks are taking place through Dec. 11, or the wider debate around the world.
In Copenhagen in 2009, the last time world leaders congregated on this scale -- 150 of them were in Le Bourget on Monday, a record outside the U.N. Assembly in New York -- to try to forge a global plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions, the "deniers" were hardly a majority. They were on the margins. But they still loomed large over the proceedings in a way that filtered down to how the event was portrayed by the international news media, myself included.
I recall making the journalistic effort to inject  "balance" into the stories I wrote by pointedly stating that there were individuals and groups that disputed the human contribution to climate change. They were vastly outnumbered and outgunned, but the dissent seemed to deserve some recognition in the interest of journalistic balance.
About a month before the summit in Copenhagen, the Climate Research Unit email controversy, or inevitably "Climategate," concentrated the minds of these dissenters.
A cadre of deniers had hacked into a database belonging to Britain's University of East Anglia and claimed to have uncovered evidence  showing that some scientists made up data to prove global warming existed. That evidence never fully materialized, but the alleged revelation cast a mini-shadow over those talks, at least in the public imagination.
It's early days for the two-week conference  in Paris, but it seems obvious that six years and a lot of hand-wringing later, climate change skepticism has been further relegated to the shadows. The evidence, scientists agree, is that clear.
Unless, of course, you are one of the leading contenders for the Republican Party's nomination to be the next president of the United States. "I consider it to be not a big problem at all," front-runner Donald Trump has said. Ben Carson, another top candidate, has said, "There is no overwhelming science that the things that are going on are man-caused and not naturally caused."
Still, this time around, I have yet to notice the balancing qualifiers so prevalent in the climate coverage of the past. Balance is not balance if it's simply wrong. It's faux balance.
The global scientific community says human-fueled climate change exists. The world's governments say it exists. The case seems clear, and decisive.
Although not to everyone. One group is showcasing its global warming doubting wares in Le Bourget's exhibition halls. The Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, or CFACT, will debut this week in Paris a documentary called Climate Hustle, billed (by CFACT) as the most important take on climate change since Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth in 2006. David Rothbard, the film's executive producer, also the president of the organization, says in a news release that the documentary "debunks the (global warming) scare and clears the way for a return to sound science and rational debate."
In the face of near unanimity from scientists and world leaders, his is a lonely crusade.

Obama finally fighting on climate change

Russ Blinch, The Huffington Post: "President Obama is set to announce new measures on Tuesday to battle climate change in what many are hoping will be a big, broad plan that will stand as his legacy for his final years in office. ... Obama will no doubt outline how the planet is in crisis from global warming, which it is. But he also needs to sell Americans on how tough new standards for carbon polluters can lead to innovation in the broader economy. And in his Sputnik moment, he needs to say the United States risks falling behind its modern-day competitor, China, if it does not act."
Connor Simpson, The Atlantic Wire: "Obviously, the White House is also hoping tackling climate change will get them some decent press in the wake of that pesky surveillance scandal. ... The president is expected to use his executive powers to adopt a wide array of climate change measures, but no one is 100% sure what those measures are just yet. ... Nothing is going to come easy for Obama when it comes to the environment, or any other issue for that matter. There's no indication as to whether or not Obama will approve the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. That move would certainly appease Republicans and make the entire climate change slate go down easier, but it would also infuriate climate change activists."
Amy Harder, National Journal: "After putting climate change on the back burner since his legislative efforts failed in Congress three years ago, Obama appears ready to again expend political clout on the issue. ... Obama is signaling that he does, indeed, want to make this a legacy issue for his administration as he had said in both his inaugural and State of the Union addresses. ... Combating climate change via regulation is the least popular and efficient way to go, analysts say, but it may be the only tool Obama has left. The plan is already inciting political backlash on Capitol Hill."
Investor's Business Daily, editorial: "Whatever happens, though, is nothing more than political theater. It's about ensuring votes from the left, paying off support from that side and digging at the foundations of economic growth. And for what? There's no global warming dragon to slay. It has been as much a myth as any fire-breathing lizard from a children's book. A world that was supposed to be sick with a human-induced fever has gone 17 years and four months without any statistically significant warming."
Andrew Restuccia, Politico: "If Gina McCarthy (nominee for administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency) didn't already have a target on her back, she does now. The president's high-profile climate change speech Tuesday -- which will include a directive to the EPA to get moving on climate change regulations -- only intensifies the already-complicated politics surrounding her confirmation. ... The president's decision to refocus on climate change sends a message to Republican members of Congress that their opposition to climate regulations and McCarthy's nomination isn't going to stand in the way of administrative action."
Bridget Johnson, PJ Tatler: "With scandals still brewing, the Senate rushing toward a vote on a massive immigration reform bill, and 'reset' Russia having facilitated the flight of NSA leaker Edward Snowden, the White House is naturally turning its focus this week to ... climate change."

Snowboarders raise their voices; Athletes sending Trump message on climate change

With Donald Trump not yet in office in early January, the advocacy group Protect Our Winters sought a way to reach out to the then-president-elect. So it tried to engage Trump on his turf -- Twitter.
Protect Our Winters, or POW, launched a Twitter campaign encouraging the incoming president to keep the Paris Agreement, an international effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Some of the top athletes in snow sports -- including Olympians Devin Logan, Alex Deibold, Elena Hight and Danny Davis -- echoed the message.
"There was really no direct line to him through like the White House switchboard," said Chris Steinkamp, executive director of Protect Our Winters. "Then we realized, my god, he's on Twitter all the time, and nobody's really used that medium in reverse. He's very famous about trying to let us know what's going on, but we've never really messaged to him."
Steinkamp says the #keepparis campaign reached 11 million people, although it did not get a response from Trump. The hashtag was tweeted 24,000 times Jan. 5-6, when POW was leading the campaign, according to Twitter.
"As you know, these athletes don't give a damn. They stand up for what they want to stand up for," Steinkamp said. "The steeper the hill for these guys, the better."
They recognize the steepness of the challenge now. Trump made comments in the past and during his presidential campaign that climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the Chinese. He has said he is considering backing out of the United States' commitment to the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
Now past Trump's inauguration, those involved in snow sports generally -- and snowboarding in particular -- have tried to further advocate on issues they've long supported. That's primarily, but not exclusively, been around climate change, an issue many athletes have partnered with POW on for years.
"I wouldn't say that I see a renewed focus, but what I do see is almost sort of like buckling down," said Deibold, a bronze medalist in the 2014 Sochi Games. "I think that we realize that the work we're doing now is more important than ever because we're fighting such an uphill battle."
Steinkamp says POW has had an "outpouring of people" wanting to get involved and donate since Trump's election. Donations are up 50% to 75%, he said. The organization says it has more than 130,000 supporters worldwide.
For the athletes involved, the story is not just theoretical. POW was founded in 2007 by professional snowboarder Jeremy Jones, and athletes have long been a part of the organization's voice. It has the support of athletes across snow sports, including skiing, ice climbing and mountaineers.
Anecdotally, the athletes see the impact that the scientific community, which has reached a consensus in man's role in climate change, finds in data. Scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported last month that 2016 was the USA's second-warmest year on record. NASA said 16 of the 17 warmest years have occurred since 2001.
"When there's someone in power who cares about that stuff and whatnot, you have a little less feel to be involved," Davis said. "And then when you have someone maybe like now, you almost feel the need to be more involved and voice it out, educate people."
Steinkamp and Donna Carpenter, who is the CEO of Burton, which makes snowboards and apparel, and a member of POW's board of directors, said athletes' voices resonate in a way advocates' voices sometimes can't. For example, an Olympian might be able to get POW a meeting with a senator rather than a chief of staff.
And they see a role for that advocacy in snowboarding's history, one in which it grew up in opposition to the ski industry, whose resorts initially barred snowboarding.
"I think snowboarders and snowboarding is in a position to say no, we speak truth to power, and the truth is we're better off with a diverse community and we're better off obviously addressing climate change, and we're better off facing the fact of globalization," Carpenter said.
Carpenter sees a role for businesses in the way some decided not to move to North Carolina after the passage of HB2. The law, known as the bathroom bill, prevents cities and counties from passing protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity and mandates that public schools require bathrooms or locker rooms be designated for use only by people based on their biological sex.
The NBA pulled its 2017 All-Star Game from the state, and the NCAA moved its championships.
Carpenter said companies like hers that are invested in snow sports would be wise not to invest in or move to states whose representatives deny climate change.
For Carpenter, the advocacy doesn't end there though. She spoke to USA TODAY Sports at the X Games a week after she personally sponsored about 30 Burton employees to attend the Women's March the day after Trump's inauguration.
"We're the rebellious adolescents of the ski industry," she said. "We look at things a little bit differently and a little irreverently. We question authority, and we always have."

Climate change could turn into a "catastrophic" threat to national and global security in the coming decades, warns a report released Monday.
"Even at scenarios of low warming, each region of the world will face severe risks to national and global security in the next three decades," the report says. "Higher levels of warming will pose catastrophic, and likely irreversible, global security risks over the course of the 21st century."
The report, titled "A Security Threat Assessment of Global Climate Change: How Likely Warming Scenarios Indicate a Catastrophic Security Future," was released by the Center for Climate and Security, a nonpartisan security policy institute.
To avoid such dire impacts, the report recommends "quickly reducing and phasing out greenhouse gas emissions."
Human-caused climate change is caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal, which release heat-trapping greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere. This has caused the planet to warm to levels that cannot be explained by natural factors, scientists say.
The globe has warmed about 2 degrees Fahrenheit since preindustrial times, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.
The report identifies major threats, including heightened social and political instability and risks to U.S. military missions and infrastructure, as well as security institutions  worldwide.
In North America, under a low-warming scenario (1.8 to 3.6 degrees by 2050), the region "will experience more intense, extreme events like storms and wildfires, with significant impacts on life, property, security infrastructure and democratic institutions," the report said.
"The assessment is clear - climate change is a pressing risk to national and global security and will evolve to become a severe and systemic threat the more we allow global temperatures to rise," said report co-author Sherri Goodman, a former deputy undersecretary of defense.
"Our panel's analysis shows that no region of the world will be left unaffected, and climate impacts will interact in dangerous ways in even near-term, lower levels of warming," Goodman said.
The report says, "Climate change will present significant threats to U.S. military missions across all of its geographic areas of responsibility as well as to regional security institutions and infrastructure that are critical for maintaining global security."

In the column "Global warming alarmists shouldn't exploit hurricanes," Myron Ebell claims that talking about the role of climate change amid the death and destruction of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma is insensitive and inappropriate.
However, nothing could be more callously insensitive to future hurricane victims than knowing that America did not take this moment to take lifesaving action to prevent future climate-change driven disasters.
Allan Margolin

After years of not having storms hit the U.S., we have a couple of hurricanes. Hurricane Harvey was a tragedy, but its torrential rainfall was due to blocking high pressure systems, not climate change. Whether you believe in climate change or not, a couple of storms hitting the U.S. doesn't mean anything.
Heidi Borden
I think it's clear that warmer water causes stronger hurricanes. It's also clear that the climate is always changing. Lastly, it's clear that pollution is bad for the environment. What is not clear is that climate change is man-made.
Scott Simpson
The global climate change discussion always neglects to offer realistic global climate solutions, assurances of success and their costs.
Mike Smith
I just want to point out that 97% of scientists agree that there is climate change and man is affecting it, and you need to look long and hard at who is funding the other 3%.
Bob Crawford
Instead of politicizing the issue, come up with a solution: Either beef up the infrastructure in areas prone to such disasters if you're going to live there, or stop building cities in those areas. Same goes for California: Don't build neighborhoods on mountain passes where wildfires regularly occur, and you won't have as much death and destruction.

Global warming cuts have a price; That's why there will be no treaty out of U.N. Climate Change Conference
USA TODAY
November 24, 2009 Tuesday, FINAL EDITION

How much would you pay to save the world from the threat of global warming? We might find out soon.
"Everything we do is tied to energy and climate," says climate economist Graciela Chichilnisky of Columbia University. "Not just the electric bill -- that's a minuscule part of it. Not just the food bill. Everything."
Come Dec. 7-18, representatives of 192 nations are set to meet in Copenhagen at the United Nations Climate Change Conference. It's by far the most significant attempt at changing the course of global warming since world leaders met in 1997 in Japan to craft the Kyoto Protocol, which aimed 37 industrialized nations at cutting emissions of six greenhouse gases (such as the carbon dioxide emitted from burning coal, oil and natural gas, aka fossil fuels) by 5.2% from 1990 levels. It was never ratified by the U.S. Senate and expires in 2012.
But despite predictions that time is running out to corral greenhouse gases, expectations already have been dashed that the Copenhagen sessions will produce a successful replacement for the Kyoto Protocol.
One reason: Technologies to cut back carbon dioxide emissions from factories and vehicles that feed the global economy add costs to fuel, food and more, an option that appeals neither to industrial nations struggling with the global economic meltdown or developing nations trying to ramp up  economic growth.
President Obama and China's Hu Jintao signaled as much when they spoke Nov. 17. Obama endorsed a "two-step" plan for Copenhagen -- agree to emissions limits there and worry about a legal treaty next year -- and neither leader stated his limits.
"Copenhagen does not need to come up with the fine print of a climate-change deal," Yvo de Boer, head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said Nov. 4 in Barcelona. "But it needs to ensure that the heart of an agreed outcome is functional and the implementation can begin swiftly."
Still, many observers feel pressure to act sooner than later.  Global temperatures have increased about 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit since 1906, according to the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Without a new treaty to halt carbon dioxide emissions, world temperatures could rise an additional 7.2 degrees by 2100,   raising fears of widespread crop failures, climate "refugees," rising seas and desertification for regions such as the Southwest.
Greenhouse gases  trap heat and warm  the atmosphere. A United Nations Environment Programme report in September found effects such as drought, melting sea ice and ocean acidification arriving ahead of, and looking worse than, the IPCC's 2007 projections.
"Business as usual" leads to an increase of more than 8 degrees, "truly a catastrophic world,"  says Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, D.C. "We've spent two decades putting this off. We won't get a second chance."
Such forecasts, though, met renewed skepticism this week with the disclosure of e-mails stolen from England's University of East Anglia, including climate researchers privately bad-mouthing critics and struggling to explain if global warming is real, why recent years' temperatures didn't exceed 1998 and 2005 levels, the warmest on record. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., says the e-mails show scientists "cooked the science"  and has called for an investigation. Climatologist Gavin Schmidt of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, however, said on the RealClimate website that the e-mails contain "no evidence of any worldwide conspiracy," just "a peek into how scientists actually interact."
Now vs. the future
Still, what is at stake at Copenhagen, Meyer and other observers say, is the world's choice for the future: one where nations hedge now against the foreseeable risks of warming or gamble today that they won't happen tomorrow, and keep on burning coal and oil.
So what would a good Copenhagen deal look like?  The United Nations'  de Boer says it would hold:
*Greenhouse-gas emission goals for industrialized nations.
*Emission-free energy goals for developing nations.
*Promises of money and machinery from industrialized nations to meet those goals.
*Agreement on how to meet those goals and commitments.
"The issue is not whether you are for or against climate change, but rather how much are you willing to sacrifice to slow climate change," says Yale economist Robert Mendelsohn.
The U.S. Senate is contemplating bills that might lead to a 17% to 20% cut in U.S. emissions by 2020. In June, the Congressional Budget Office estimated the costs of creating a carbon "market" to achieve such cuts would be about $175 a year by then for the average household. With efficiency measures added, the Environmental Protection Agency says the bill proposal would actually lower energy costs for households but cause huge changes in the energy business -- with fossil fuels falling from about 85% of U.S. electricity generation today to 30% by 2050 -- costing jobs at coal plants while adding them in solar, wind and nuclear energy.
A flurry of meetings have led up to Copenhagen, starting with the 2007 session in Bali, where the Bush administration committed the nation to taking part in Copenhagen. The road to Copenhagen really started, however, in 1992, when the USA signed on to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, agreeing to keep global warming effects below "dangerous levels."
So what's dangerous? In March, a Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences report updating earlier danger estimates found nothing but negative consequences should global temperatures rise more than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
The present concentration of carbon dioxide, the biggest player in global warming greenhouse gases, in the atmosphere stands at about 388 parts per million, compared with roughly 270 ppm prior to the Industrial Revolution. At the atmospheric equivalent of 450 ppm concentrations, the world faces a 50%  chance of seeing global temperatures rise more than 3.6 degrees.
"The meeting's challenge is to get developed nations on line to economies that are low-carbon, and get developing nations investing in energy technologies that allow them to grow without entering the carbon-emitting trap," says Frances Beinecke, author of Clean Energy Common Sense: An American Call to Action on Global Climate Change. "Copenhagen has to send them a signal that we are serious."
In the U.S. Senate, that signal, a clean-energy bill, looks unlikely to pass this year as legislators look at the details, says  Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., a sponsor of one leading proposal.  The bills all center on creation of a national "cap-and-trade" system, where rights to emit greenhouse gases are capped, and then sold and traded among industries.
Meanwhile, de Boer says, industrialized nations would more likely have to cut emissions about 80% to not cross the 450 ppm danger line. In 2007, the IPCC estimated such a cut would trigger a 3% reduction of the global economy, an impossible proposition amid a global recession, says David Victor of the University of California-San Diego.
"As soon as we put a price on carbon, the increased price will pass all the way down (to consumers)," says Jae Edmonds of the Joint Global Change Research Institute at the University of Maryland. "When I consider my home heating-oil bill, my natural-gas bill in the winter, the prices will drive decisions."
A practical approach
Doing nothing costs, too. In October, for example, a National Research Council panel estimated that burning fossil fuels costs $120 billion in health expenses nationwide every year, mostly from at least 18,000 premature deaths caused by pollution, with a "middle ground" estimate of climate damages of $350 billion from storms, drought, wildfire and related effects.
"President Obama was just stating the obvious. There is no use in pretending that a full and final treaty will be ready by Copenhagen," Victor says.   Expecting 192 nations  to agree on anything realistic, he adds, seems like a bad strategy.
Instead, he suggests the major nations releasing greenhouse gases, particularly China and the United States, cut direct deals to save time.
"I just think that is the most practical approach," he says.
Chichilnisky says this idea won't work, because poor nations will then barrel down the fossil fuel path to industrialization without a global treaty that gives them a reason to invest in low-emission power.
In 2006, a British government report, the "Stern Review," estimated that addressing climate change through efficiency, low-emission technologies and a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gases, among other steps, would subtract about 1%  from global Gross Domestic Product in 2050, as opposed to a roughly 5% to 20% cost to global GDP if nothing were done. Mendelsohn and other economists criticized this high cost estimate and its all-or-nothing response to climate change, rather than a step-by-step one.
"People seeking such a stringent policy that ensures global warming will not be harmful will demand such an expensive strategy that no one will agree to do anything," Mendelsohn says. "In contrast, if we sought a moderate policy that will eventually lead to substantial reductions of greenhouse gases, it is very likely one could get global agreement in Copenhagen." 

Powerhouse topics of discussion
The International Energy Agency (IAE) says global energy will grow 40% by 2030. Fossil fuels make 75% of energy today, but some technologies can cut greenhouse emissions.
Coal power
-- "Clean" coal, with carbon dioxide emissions shunted to underground reserves, is  crucial to cutting future greenhouse gases,  according to the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  A big task, it will add to energy bills and require 50% more pipelines than today's U.S. petroleum industry uses.
Natural gas
-- Natural gas is the lowest-impact fossil fuel for greenhouse gases and is the fastest-growing energy source nationwide. Even if Copenhagen produces limits on  global greenhouse gas, natural-gas use is likely to increase --  perhaps 17% worldwide by 2030, IAE says --  because of its low rate of greenhouse emissions.
Wind power
-- The renewable-energy source seeing the biggest short-term increase is wind power, with  U.S. wind farms raising their capacity 50% in 2008 --  more than  8,500 megawatts.  Texas, Iowa, California, Minnesota and Washington lead the nation  in wind power, says the American Wind Energy Association.
Leaders vs. global warming
Copenhagen hosts global climate treaty talks in December. Some world leaders have offered up greenhouse gas cuts already, and some haven't:
USA: President Obama has pledged to "take significant mitigation actions and stand  behind these commitments" at Copenhagen. But no hard numbers yet. Congress contemplates 17% to 20% cuts.
China: President Hu Jintao pledged "notable" cuts in growth of emissions by 2020.  No hard numbers. But China has signed clean- energy agreements and has stricter gas-mileage rules than the U.S. has.
United Nations: Yvo  de Boer, executive  secretary of the United  Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, says industrialized nations need 80% cuts compared with 2005 emissions.
Maldives: President Mohamed Nasheed pledges his nation will be "carbon neutral" with effectively zero emissions by 2050 and looks to grow algae to store carbon emissions for climate credits.
Japan: Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama pledges a 25% cut, compared with 1990 levels, by 2020. The campaign pledge revitalized moves toward a world climate agreement in September.

UN: Climate change greater threat than coronavirus

The planet is "way off track" in dealing with climate change, a new United Nations report says, and experts declared that climate change is a far greater threat than the coronavirus.
"It is important that all the attention that needs to be given to fight this disease does not distract us from the need to defeat climate change," U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Tuesday, according to Agence France Presse.
Although emissions have been reduced with travel curtailed because of the virus, Guterres noted that "we will not fight climate change with a virus. Whilst the disease is expected to be temporary, climate change has been a phenomenon for many years, and and will remain with us for decades and require constant action."
The report confirmed that 2019 was the second-warmest year on record and the past decade the hottest in human history.
Last year ended with a global average temperature that was 1.1 degree Celsius above estimated preindustrial levels, second only to the record set in 2016, when a very strong El Niño event contributed to an increased global temperature atop the overall warming trend.
"We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5°C or 2°C targets that the Paris Agreement calls for," Guterres wrote in the report.
"Greenhouse gas concentrations are at the highest levels in 3 million years - when the Earth's temperature was as much as 3 degrees hotter and sea levels some 15 meters higher," said Guterres at a joint news conference with World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas at U.N. headquarters in New York.

To fight climate change, start with celebs, pols

If climate change is really such a crisis, and if sacrifice on our part is needed to stop it, why aren't we seeing more sacrifice from people who think it's a problem?
As one person asked on Twitter, "What if climate scientists decided, as a group, to make their conferences all virtual? No more air travel. What a statement!" And what if academics in general -- most of whom think climate change is a big deal -- started doing the same thing to make an even bigger statement?
What if politicians and celebrities stopped jetting around the world -- often on wasteful private jets instead of flying commercial with the hoi polloi -- as a statement of the importance of fighting climate change?
And what if they lived in average-sized houses, to reduce their carbon footprints? What if John Kerry, who was much put out by President Trump's withdrawal from the non-binding Paris agreement, gave up his yacht-and-mansions lifestyle?
What if, indeed? One reason so many people don't take climate change seriously is that the people who constantly tell us it's a crisis never actually act like it's a crisis. Some might say that's why we need laws. I have some proposals that take climate change seriously indeed.
First, we need to tax the "blue zones." That is, we need to impose steep taxes on property in coastal areas that will be flooded by the sea-level increases that global warming is supposed to bring. By discouraging people from living or building there now, we'll save ourselves from big problems in the future. Sure it'll drive down property values, but those values should go down -- that property is going to be flooded anyway, remember?
Second, we need to ban taxpayer-funded air travel to conferences. State legislatures could ban reimbursement for travel outside their states; Congress could require that no federal grant money be spent on air travel to conferences and similar events. A lot of academic conferences would fail, but that's a small price to pay for saving the planet.
Third, we need to ban private jet travel. It's nice that Leonardo DiCaprio can jet around the world speaking against climate change, but the carbon emissions involved set a bad example that outweighs anything he might say. So no more private jets. Bigshots will just have to fly commercial like everyone else, the way they did in the 1950s. Politicians, too, should have to fly commercial. No more government-funded "executive jets" for them.
Fourth, we need a luxury tax on mansions. Any home more than twice the size of the average American home should be taxed at 25% of its value per year.
I'm sure enterprising members of Congress and state legislatures can come up with more ideas. But the important thing is to set a good example: Treat climate change like the crisis you say it is, and maybe more people will believe it really is a crisis.

Why you should sweat climate change; More asthma, heat strokes and flooding (and that's just the warm-up act)
USA TODAY
March 1, 2013 Friday, FINAL EDITION

More American children are getting asthma and allergies, and more seniors are suffering heat strokes.
Food and utility prices are rising. Flooding is overrunning bridges, swamping subways and closing airport runways.
People are losing jobs in drought-related factory closings. Cataclysmic storms are wiping out sprawling neighborhoods. Towns are sinking.
This isn't a science-fiction, end-of-the-world scenario. Though more anecdotal than normal -- today, at least -- these scenes are already playing out somewhere in the United States, and they're expected to get worse in the years ahead. In fact, a remaking of America is likely in our lifetimes -- a flicker in geological time. This will transform how and where we live, work and play.
Massachusetts' climate will start to look more like North Carolina's, and Illinois will begin to feel like Texas. Montana's Glacier National Park, a glorious site that draws tourists from around the world, will likely lose its glaciers.
Climate change is partly the culprit. Scientific research shows that it's increasing the risk and intensity of heat waves, downpours, drought and wildfires. A key factor: the burning of fossil fuels. With these changes come rising sea levels and acidified oceans. So when Superstorm Sandy struck New York harbor in October, the flooding that killed scores of people, ruined thousands of homes and closed subways as well as airports came amid already rising seas.
As the planet edges this year toward what some scientists say will be the highest concentration of heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions in at least 800,000 years, USA TODAY reporters will travel the country to explore places where climate change is already affecting lives.
Not all of it is bad news. As with any change, there will be winners and losers, especially at the local level. There will be longer growing seasons, lower heating bills and fewer cold-related deaths. Melting Arctic sea ice is opening the Northwest Passage off Alaska's coast  to tourism, maritime shipping and oil exploration.
Yet on a national level, the losers will probably outnumber the winners, according to a draft report of the third National Climate Assessment released by the U.S. government in January.
Americans can adapt to some climate change, and indeed already are, but a continuing rise in global carbon emissions will make adapting increasingly costly and difficult -- especially in developed coastal areas.
Some potential impacts, such as higher flood-insurance premiums for luxury waterfront homes or more bald spots on ski slopes, might seem trivial. Others -- lower home values on the coasts, heat-related deaths in the Midwest or the relocation of entire villages in Alaska -- not so much.
The effects of this new world are reverberating from coast to coast:
"Who's going to hire me now?" asks Barbara Roberts, 56, who lost her job of 36 years a month ago on Feb. 1 when a Cargill beef-processing plant in Plainview, Texas, closed. The facility, which employed 2,000 people, was starved of cattle because of the drought. Roberts, who earned $13.70 an hour plus benefits, says she hurt her back after 20 years on the production line, leaving her unable to lift heavy items. The only other large, decent-paying employer in town, she says, is Walmart.
"My house isn't straight anymore. It's tilted," says Jeff Miskill, a contractor in Norfolk, Va., where rising sea levels have contributed to repeated flooding throughout the city and a shifting of the ground under his home.
"You can feel it inside. You feel like you're walking uphill." Miskill says neighbors aren't worried about the semantics of what's happening, whether climate change or flooding. "Call it what you will," he says, "but we have a water problem."
"My windows and doors are rotted away," says Stanley Tom, 52, the tribal administrator of Newtok, Alaska, a place where severe flooding is always a risk. The area's infrastructure was built on permafrost -- soil saturated with frozen water -- that because of higher temperatures is now melting into mud. Roads and runways have been ruined, and water supplies are contaminated.
All of Newtok's 350 or so residents are being relocated from the eroding coastline to higher ground because, as Tom says, "the village is sinking."
Inside 'the mixed bag'
Scores of politicians and millions of Americans are skeptics. After all, no single storm, heat wave or wildfire -- unlike longer-term patterns -- can be linked directly to climate change. These esteemed scientists don't have all the answers, particularly as their projections stretch far into the future. Although almost all agree on the broad contours of human-induced climate change, they continue to refine the details as new data and better tracking technology -- such as a series of NASA satellites launched in 2000 -- become available.
"It's a mixed bag," says Kerry Emanuel, a climate scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, about the link between extreme weather and climate change. Though Emanuel once doubted the evidence, he now says the world is clearly warming beyond its natural variability.
Emanuel, author of What We Know About Climate Change, says rainfall may have the clearest climate link. He says it now occurs less often, but when it does rain, downpours are more likely. So wet regions will be wetter, causing flash flooding. Dry ones will get drier, resulting in drought. Heat, of course, is another consequence. So a heat wave that used to occur once every 100 years now happens every five years.
An indicator of that warming is the rising concentration of carbon-dioxide emissions in the atmosphere -- now at 396 parts per million, according to January data by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It was about 275 parts per million two centuries ago, and research by British Antarctic Survey's Eric Wolff suggests that it probably hasn't exceeded 400 ppm -- likely within the next few years worldwide -- in at least 800,000 years. Leading climate scientists, including NASA's James Hansen, warn that concentrations above 350 ppm risk planetary perils, including melting ice sheets and rapidly spreading drought.
The most recent decade was the nation's hottest on record, and 2012 was the hottest single year. The average U.S. temperature has risen 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since reliable record-keeping began in 1895 -- 80% of that has occurred since 1980. The increase might seem small, but scientists warn that a ripple effect can trigger "tipping points," beyond which the planet may not be able to recover.
For example, the warmer the air, the more summer Arctic sea ice is lost. The more sea ice that's lost, the more warming occurs because ice reflects sunlight while water absorbs it. As the atmosphere warms, it holds larger amounts of water vapor, which could help energize everything from hurricanes to snowstorms. And the cycle continues.
Average U.S. temperatures will likely rise at least another 2 degrees to 4 degrees in most places in the next few decades and between 3 to 10 degrees by 2100, depending on the amount of oil, gas and coal we burn, according to the draft of the 2013 National Climate Assessment. The report, written by 240 private and government scientists, is based on hundreds of studies published in science journals.
Higher temperatures mean higher sea levels, too. The reason's simple: As water warms, it expands. While global sea level has risen 8 inches since 1900 and is projected to rise another 1 to 4 feet by 2100, the problem is worse along the U.S. Atlantic Coast  because of differences in ocean currents, salinity, water temperatures and land movements.
The economic costs of all these changes are enormous -- not only for those directly affected but also for the nation's taxpayers, who are stuck with the bills for disaster relief, national flood insurance and drought-related crop losses. In February, for the first time, the non-partisan General Accountability Office said climate change puts the U.S. government at "high risk "of financial exposure. NOAA says 11 extreme weather and climate events last year alone in the United States cost more than $1 billion each.
At the heart of it: Water
For Jimmy Strickland, climate issues aren't theoretical. They're business. He owns an accounting firm with a one-story brick office building two blocks from Norfolk's waterfront. During his 35 years in the Hague section of town, three huge storms have struck -- all in the past decade. Each time, his building flooded and had to be closed at least two months for repairs that cost his insurance company about $250,000.
"You lose time, and time is money," Strickland says.
While Norfolk is second only to New Orleans for sea-level rise, partly because its land is naturally sinking, other coastal U.S. cities -- Boston; Charleston, S.C.; Miami; New York; Seattle; San Francisco; Tampa -- are vulnerable, too.
"It's a harbinger of things to come," says Leonard Berry, a geoscience professor at Florida Atlantic University, of the regular high-tide flooding on Miami's streets. The Army Corps of Engineers expects that South Florida's sea level will rise 3 to 7 inches by 2030; the range jumps from 9 to 24 inches by 2060.
While there's too much water in some places, there's not enough in others. Drought afflicted as much as 65% of the contiguous lower 48 states last year and still lingers in more than half of the country. Corn, wheat and soybean crops were decimated, prompting higher food prices. Nearly two dozen ethanol plants in 13 states halted production because they lacked a key ingredient: corn.
In Plainview, Texas, Cargill's plant closing took workers by surprise.
"They didn't tell us 'til that day," Roberts says. "It was 10:45 a.m. when the announcement came: 'Everyone off the floor.'" She says they went to the cafeteria for the news. "We didn't go back to the floor. We went home."
"The U.S. cattle herd is at its lowest level since 1952," Cargill Beef's president, John Keating, said in announcing the closure. He said the company held off "as long as possible," hoping the drought would break. "Unfortunately," he added, "the drought has not broken."
But heat alone is a hazard
Others have suffered from, if not drought, the heat itself.
"It's the silent killer," says Laurence Kalkstein, a University of Miami professor who studies the effect of heat on health. He says if climate change brings hotter -- but still variable -- weather, more heat-related deaths will likely occur.
Riley Kimble was found dead in a tiny, stifling apartment without air conditioning in Chicago last July on a day when outside temperatures reached 103. The city's medical examiner said heat stress contributed to his death and that of at least two dozen others. He was 59.
His stepdaughter, Nicole Hughes,  says he suffered from schizophrenia. As a young man, before his illness struck, she says, Kimble was a college student and avid reader who helped her with homework. He was the only dad she ever knew.
Ernestine Williams says she's struggling to "keep it together" since her daughter Mary, then 56, died in the same Chicago heat wave. She lives on a widow's pension but has taken in Mary's three young adult children, who she says took the death "real hard.  No one was prepared for that."

3 debates, and barely a mention of climate change

Aside from the possibility that mankind will blow itself up, no issue is more important to the long-term future of the planet than global warming. Rising sea levels, devastating flooding, heat waves and droughts are already causing human misery and economic disruption. Yet discussion of climate change has been oddly lacking from the seemingly endless presidential campaign.
In the three  debates, the topic was mentioned only fleetingly. At the second debate, the red sweater worn by town hall audience member Ken Bone attracted far more attention than the candidates' response to his question about energy policy.
The lack of attention to the issue is disappointing, but not surprising. Human-induced climate change doesn't lend itself to brief sounds bites, and political systems are particularly unsuited to dealing with this kind of problem.
For one thing, global warming is a slow-motion crisis that will unfold, largely invisibly, over decades. No individual extreme weather event -- this week's record heat in the East, or the excessive rainfall in the Carolinas from Hurricane Matthew -- can be conclusively linked to human disruption of the climate.
Moreover, as with pension promises to public employees, today's politicians will be long gone when the worst effects manifest themselves. The powerful fossil fuel lobby resists change; it underwrites organizations that challenge the science and confuse the public. And no individual city, state or nation can solve the climate problem; that will take a global effort in which individual countries have economic incentives to cheat on their emissions-reduction pledges.
Given all these obstacles, the progress of the past year has actually been remarkable. Last year's Paris treaty to curb greenhouse gas emissions has been ratified by 81 parties and is set to take effect on Nov. 4. A narrower agreement limits emissions from jetliners. And, last weekend in Rwanda, more than 170 nations agreed to phase out powerful, heat-trapping refrigerants known as hydrofluorocarbons.
Continued progress depends in large part on U.S. leadership, the extent of which will depend on the outcome of the presidential election. As on so many other issues, the candidates have diametrically opposed positions.
Democrat Hillary Clinton thinks climate change is real; she says she'd work with international leaders to stabilize and reduce emissions, and with local leaders to invest in flood-protection projects.
Republican Donald Trump, meanwhile, has said that he's "not a great believer in man-made climate change," that he would cancel the Paris climate agreement, and that there are bigger risks to worry about.
Certainly, there is room for discussion about the precise degree to which human activity is contributing to global warming. There is also room for debate on the best ways to address the problem. But Trump's blithe dismissal of the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change is yet one more reason the Republican nominee ought not be president.

Skipping class today? Students will rally for climate change

SAN FRANCISCO - Tens of thousands of high school students in cities nationwide plan to skip classes Friday to attend Global Climate Strike marches calling for immediate action to end climate change. They will be part of a global joint protest aimed directly at the adults who they say are ignoring the destruction of the planet.
"We have to treat climate change as what it is - an emergency," said Audrey Maurine Xin Lin, an 18-year-old who's been one of the coordinators of the Boston school strike and march.
The events come out of a groundswell of worry on the part of young people about the future of the planet. Students in more than 800 locations around the United States plan to go on strike from school for the day to attend protests.
"It's going to be a really, really powerful day, the launch of a new era of climate movement. This is just the beginning for us," said Katie Eder, 19, who is the executive director of the Future Coalition, a youth-led nonprofit helping the groups coordinate.
The protests are timed to begin a week of activism at the United Nations, including a Youth Climate Summit on Saturday and a U.N. Climate Action Summit on Monday. A second strike is planned for Friday, Sept. 27.
Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, 16, put a face on the global movement beginning in August 2018 when she began skipping school on Fridays to stand outside the Swedish parliament holding a sign protesting inaction on climate change. She came to New York on a solar-powered sailboat to attend the strike in New York City and then the summit.
The movement is not led by her, but a broad group of young people who say they are frightened for their futures and angry that adults have done so little. Unlike the Vietnam War protests, which were mostly college students, the organizers of these events are mostly high school and even some middle school students.
"I want to emphasize that our entire organizing team is under 20. Young people and students have really been leading this," Lin said. She and four other teens were on a press call Wednesday describing the work they're doing and why it's important.
The young people said they want politicians to act as if the world's on fire and begin curbing carbon emissions and taking the fight against global warming seriously.
"We won't have the chance to make the changes we need to if we don't have the courage to fight," said Dulce Belen Ceballos Arias, 18, from Redwood City, California. She is helping plan the San Francisco march.
"I want to have children of my own and I want them to have a life better than me and I don't want that chance to be taken away from them," she said.
Young people aren't the only ones getting involved. Multiple companies, mostly on the smaller side, are shutting down for the day so employees can attend local marches. They include Ben & Jerry's, Patagonia, Burton and SodaStream.
But while the students say they're happy to have adults march and get involved, for them this is personal.
"It's our future that's at stake," said Gabriella Marchesani, 17, a Miami Strike youth leader.
While some school districts are giving students who attend the marches an excused absence, others aren't. In Florida, Miami-Dade County Public Schools is not, a district spokeswoman said.
Marchesani sees that as misguided in a city that is expected to be hit hard by rising sea levels in the coming years and where "our houses might be underwater soon."

Climate change no longer future threat: Disease, heat hurting us now, study finds

Climate change is already having an extraordinary impact on human health worldwide -- affecting the spread of infectious diseases, exposing millions to air pollution and heat waves and dramatically reducing labor productivity, according to a report released Monday.
"The human symptoms of climate change are unequivocal and potentially irreversible," the report by the British medical journal The Lancet says, and the situation is so serious that significant gains by modern medicine and technology are being undercut.
"The delayed response to climate change over the past 25 years has jeopardized human life and livelihoods," the report says.
While most previous similar studies have covered the potential impact of climate change on future public health problems, The Lancet report goes a step further and illustrates how it is no longer a future threat but a current one.
The direct effects of climate change "result from rising temperatures and changes in the frequency and strength of storms, floods, droughts and heat waves -- with physical and mental health consequences," it says.
For example, from 2000 to 2016, there has been a 46% increase in the number of weather-related disasters, the report notes.
Some of the findings:
Warming is exacerbating the spread of Dengue fever, the world's most rapidly expanding disease. In fact, two types of mosquitoes' ability to spread Dengue globally has increased by 9.4% and 11.1% since the 1950s.
An additional 125 million people around the world were exposed to heat waves each year from 2000 to 2016 (as compared with 1986-2008) and a record 175 million people were exposed to heat waves in 2015.
Rising temperatures have led to a 5.3% fall in labor productivity in the planet's rural areas since 2000, with a dramatic drop of 2% from 2015 to 2016. In 2016, this effectively took more than 920,000 people out of the global workforce.
Global exposure to dangerous levels of air pollution has increased by 11.2% since 1990.
Climate change is also worsening allergies in the United States. For example, Americans faced significantly longer exposure to ragweed pollen in 2016 compared with 1990.

Tough love is needed on climate change

Launching into coverage of climate change right now is like tuning into a football game that's half over and your team is on its way to losing. The only question is by how much.
Even if every word of last December's breakthrough Paris Agreement is implemented and global warming is slowed, according to climate scientists I've interviewed, nations might moderate the planetary abuse caused by generations of mankind pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, ocean, plants and soil.
At best, a catastrophe might be averted, they say.
But theirs is the joy of a patient learning that a diagnosis may not be terminal -- only crippling. It's a reality reflected in the hooded expression of my youngest son, Noah, when the topic arises. At 20, he realizes all too well the world we've left his generation.
"We're committed to a path that is taking us into parts unknown, and there's no turning back," says Gavin Schmidt, a NASA climatologist. "There are only choices about how much of an unknown situation we put ourselves in."
The Paris Agreement, since signed by 180 nations, would limit global warming by the year 2100 to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees F), compared with pre-industrial levels.
An added push for a 1.5-degree limit could make a huge positive difference for the planet.
But even at that stricter limit, Earth still will see rising sea levels, persistent droughts, species extinction and volatile weather patterns, the climate specialists say.
"The world has already signed itself up for some level of climatic impact," says Nick Nuttall, spokesman for the U.N. Climate Change secretariat. "The amount of pollution amassed over the two centuries of industrialization -- you can't just suck it up with a vacuum cleaner."
Oh, if only it were 1980, says Katherine Hayhoe.
Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University, says a Paris Agreement and the renewable energy efforts gaining speed today would have had a profound impact on a far less sullied planet 35 years ago.
"Our carbon dioxide levels now are over 400 parts per million," Hayhoe says, referring to what scientists says is a historic milestone reached this past year for a gas that is shrouding the planet like a blanket. "Our global temperature changes are already pushing 1 degree Celsius."
In the past, scientists warning of climate change were labeled alarmists. But most of their calculations are proving to be accurate.
If anything, they have underestimated the changes underway. A 2012 analysis at the University of Alberta in Canada found a scientific bias in climate research toward "erring on the side of least drama."
Climate scientist Michael Mann -- co-author of the new book The Madhouse Effect, about the threat posed by denialism -- says many uncertainties concerning global warming "appear to be breaking against us, rather than for us."
"Arctic sea ice is disappearing faster than the models projected," he says. "The continental ice sheets (in Greenland and the Antarctic) are losing ice faster than expected."
Another surprise was uncovered in a study Mann co-authored last year in Climate Nature Change.
It found disturbing evidence that a North Atlantic current crucial in controlling weather patterns was slowing, possibly because of an influx of fresh water from melting ice in Greenland.
So much needs to be done so quickly that the Paris treaty goals for limiting warming may already be unattainable.
"I would say people are pretty pessimistic about that. I've not found anybody that actually thinks 1.5 (degrees Celsius) is at all realistic" because too much of society remains unwilling or unable to act, says NASA climatologist Schmidt.
What's needed now is some tough love on the topic. "The earth is going to look like a different place," says Peter Tans, chief greenhouse gas scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. "It's very scary stuff."
"We need to be upfront with our children," Mann says. "Such a world would not be unlike the dystopian worlds depicted by Hollywood in movies like Soylent Green or The Hunger Games. Fortunately such a future is still avoidable. The challenge is to act. Now."

Climate change on center stage; Democrats' town hall caps big week for issue

There's perhaps no topic that more starkly divides Democratic hopefuls and President Donald Trump than the debate on climate change.
On voters' minds
74% of likely voters ages 18 to 29 disapprove of Trump's handling of climate change concerns
53% of likely voters agree that the government should do more to curb climate change even at the expense of economic growth.
Harvard University poll published in March
Democrats writ large see global warming as an existential crisis, while Trump has dismissed the issue.
Yet, until this week, global warming has remained largely on the back burner in an internal Democratic debate that has largely focused on who is best equipped to take on Trump in the general election and whether pursuing "Medicare for All" is the best way to fix health care in America.
That could be changing.
Top Democratic hopefuls this week tried to demonstrate how they would approach turning the tide on global warming should they become the next commander in chief.
"We see that now with Hurricane Dorian," said former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, who was among 10 leading Democrats invited by CNN to talk part in marathon climate town hall Wednesday and was among five Democrats this week to unveil a climate agenda. "The Arctic ice caps melting. The Amazon on fire. We don't need climate scientists to tell us what we see with our eyes."
There is little disagreement among the Democratic hopefuls who joined Castro on stage - Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, California Sen. Kamala Harris, former Vice President Joe Biden, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker - that climate change is a mounting catastrophe that Washington and the world need to take immediate action on. But candidates are trying to highlight their credentials as true champions on the issue, which polls show is among the highest priorities of likely Democratic primary and caucus voters.
The issue is particularly salient with young people - voters 18 to 23 are projected to make up one in 10 eligible voters in 2020. A Harvard University poll  in March found 74% of likely voters 18 to 29 disapprove of Trump's handling of climate issues, and 53% of likely voters agree  the government should do more to curb climate change even at the expense of economic growth.
Human-induced warming reached approximately 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, according to a 2017 United Nation's Intergovernmental Plan on Climate Change. Scientists project dire  consequences should the planet warm by 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial levels.
"Heat waves would last around a third longer, rain storms would be about a third more intense, the increase in sea level would be approximately that much higher and the percentage of tropical coral reefs at risk of severe degradation would be roughly that much greater," according to NASA.
Castro on Wednesday said he would set a goal of pushing the country to end its reliance on carbon-fueled energy by 2045. He said his first act, should he be elected, would be to take executive action declaring to recommit to the Paris climate agreement, an international pact to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that Trump notified fellow signatories the U.S. would officially leave in November 2020.
Warren said she would spend $3 trillion on research and investment to cut carbon emissions. Her agenda includes making sure that new cars, buses and many trucks run on clean energy - instead of gasoline or diesel - by 2030 and that all the country's electricity comes from solar, wind and other renewable, carbon-free sources by 2035.
"We have a chance to turn this around in 2020, but we're running out of time," Warren said.
Sanders, who has unveiled a $16.3 trillion climate plan that he says would create 20 million jobs, end private utilities and ban hydraulic fracking, pushed back against the notion the nation can't afford his agenda.
"Maybe, just maybe, instead of spending a trillion and a half dollars every single year on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other, maybe we pool those resources and we work together against our common enemy, which is climate change," Sanders said.
Harris said she would move to ban hydraulic fracking and consider getting rid of the legislative filibuster in the Senate in order to pass the Green New Deal. The far-reaching  legislation,  derided by Trump as economic flimflam, aims to tackle climate change. By ending the filibuster, the legislation could be passed with a simple majority in the upper chamber instead of the 60-vote threshold currently needed.
She has also pitched a $10 trillion spending plan that sets out for the U.S. to reach the goal of 100% carbon-neutral electricity by 2030.
Harris said from Day 1 as president, if she's elected, she will make clear to the scientists in the U.S. government that her administration "will back you up" as it changes government approach to fighting rising global temperatures.
"Let's just be really clear: Donald Trump, he's got everyone excited by those crazy tweets," she said. "Meanwhile, with this hand he's quietly undoing regulations that were built over years, including incredible stuff the Obama administration did. Everybody is distracted by the crazy tweet. Meanwhile, he's completely deregulating industry."
Biden, the Democratic front-runner, has floated a more modest $1.7 trillion agenda for clean energy spending over 10 years and set the goal of eliminating the country's net carbon emissions by 2050. He pushed back on a question by CNN moderator Anderson Cooper about whether his plan is not aggressive enough - a notion that has been repeated by some environmental activists as well as rivals for the nomination.
"I think it is aggressive enough, and it's got good reviews from most of the environmental community," Biden said. "Science and technology are going to change, and as it charges, we learn more and can do more."
Buttigieg said that solving the climate crisis is perhaps the greatest challenge that humanity has faced since World War II. The mayor, who this week introduced a $1.5 trillion climate plan that he said would create 3 million clean energy and infrastructure jobs, went on to say failure to act was akin to sin, wondering out loud about what God thinks as the environment is destroyed.
"I also frankly think of it more selfishly when we talk about hitting this target of 2050 for decarbonizing our economy," said Buttigieg, the youngest of White House hopefuls at 37. "Lord willing, I plan to be here - I would be in my 60s by the time we know whether we have succeeded and can look back and be proud of what we did to getting on the right tack or realize we are the ones that blew it."
The climate forum didn't go unnoticed by Trump. He took to Twitter to blast Democrats' "destructive" proposals that he predicted would raise energy bills and prices at the pump.
"Don't the Democrats care about fighting American poverty?" Trump offered as a part of stream of tweets that served as a prebuttal.
On Wednesday, the administration also announced it was rolling back Energy Department requirements to make commonly used bulbs more efficient.
The new standards were included in energy legislation implemented under President George W. Bush and finalized under the Obama administration. The news standards, which would have gradually phased out incandescent and halogen bulbs, were set to go into effect in January 2020.
"I think he's just messing with CNN on that," longshot candidate  Yang joked.
Klobuchar noted at the town hall that the Ojibwe tribe has a saying to think about the impact their decisions will have on seven generations.
"We have a president that can't make a decision about seven minutes from now," Klobuchar said.

Wineries adapt to climate change; Vineyards and livelihoods around the world are at risk

ST. HELENA, Calif. - The estate house grounds at Spottswoode Winery look like a postcard from a 19th-century dream. A sprawling Victorian mansion commands a view of lush gardens, a shimmering swimming pool and 45 acres of grape-filled vines that soon will be harvested.
A very 21st-century menace casts a shadow over this sunny scene: climate change.
Soaring temperatures, irregular rain patterns and the ever-present threat of firescause winery owners here and around the world to adopt aggressive strategies to safeguard their livelihoods.  Tactics include experimenting with new varieties of grapes, finding new ways to use  water  and even seeking out land in areas that used to be too cold for vineyards.
"My parents started this winery, and I'm looking at passing it down," says Beth Novak Milliken, 58, CEO of Spottswoode Estate Vineyard and Winery, whose Cabernet Sauvignon can fetch $90 to $225 a bottle. "But to do that, I now have to plan ahead in a way I never thought I'd have to."
From 2012 to 2014, the winery in Napa County north of the San Francisco Bay Area experienced about six days over 98.6 degrees during each April-through-October growing season. That number rocketed to 17 days in 2015 and a record 21 in 2017 -  when temperatures hit a desert-like 118 degrees on a few occasions. The level of heat stresses the vines in unprecedented ways, sending temperatures inside the grapes soaring  upward of 150 degrees, risking the collapse of the delicate ripening and maturation process that is crucial to high-end winemaking.
"In 2017, we saw our vineyard go into stasis, a period where chemically nothing was happening, which was unheard of," says Aron Weinkauf, 43, Spottswoode's winemaker and vineyard manager. "This is not a crop you get a few shots at a year, like vegetables. It's just one chance each year to get it right. That translates to very expensive farming. So we have to do everything we can to ensure the longevity of this vineyard despite the huge pressure of climate change."
Measures include extensively shading the vineyards, developing cover crops that can help with either drought or flooding, and planting experimental rootstocks - the foundational root that lies below the ground - that may be better suited to higher temperatures.
"People around these parts are no longer talking about climate change as an 'if' or a 'when,'" Novak Milliken says. "It's here."
And it's global. Winemakers in both hemispheres are adapting to new climate norms.
New World is the future
In South Africa, a severe drought in May 2018 caused a 15% drop in the grape harvest, sending prices up and wineries scrambling to find new ways to leverage technology to manage irrigation, says Wanda Augustyn of VinPro, a trade association that represents South African wine producers.
In Spain, renowned winemakers Familia Torres have begun buying land high in the foothills of the Pyrenees mountains that border France, a zone whose consistently cool temperatures once made the area inhospitable to growing grapes but that climate change has made attractive.
In France, the hallowed home of the cultivated grape, the industry's strict governing body, the INAO, decreed last year that winemakers could  experiment with new grape varietals that could be used to balance out juice from harvests increasingly disrupted by hotter summers that lead to earlier cultivation and even increased alcohol levels.
Though winemaking's ancestral heart may be rooted in European soil, its future has always been in the New World, says Karl Storchmann, professor of economics at New York University and editor of the Journal of Wine Economics.
The USA is the world's largest retail wine market, valued at $70 billion in 2018, and the fourth-largest wine-producing nation behind Italy, Spain and France. Climate change  could reshape those numbers, Storchmann says.
"Fine-wine quality and prices are extraordinarily sensitive to fluctuations in the weather and the year in which the grapes were grown," Storchmann says. "Wine is an 'experience' good - that is, its quality cannot be ascertained before consumption."
Many winemakers look north. Storchmann says he sees vineyard land prices in southern France drop while prices in the north rise.
"The same can be seen in Canada and the United Kingdom," he says. "Northern regions are winning, while southern regions are losing, and vice versa in the Southern Hemisphere."
Christine Clair is winery director at Willamette Valley Vineyards in Turner, Oregon, south of Salem. Though the region is known for its cool climate, which is especially  hospitable to thin-skinned varietals such as pinot noir, Clair and her team have over the past few years looked  to plant at higher elevations - moving from below 500 feet to 500 to 800 feet - as the lower zones heat up.
The winery's vines have produced higher crop yields because of new periods of unusual heat. "The accounting team really likes it," Clair says. "We can farm more fruit."
But she's aware that if warming trends continue, "our winery will have to look for cooler spots to maintain the stylistic goals we have for our product."
Her team remains vigilant of wildfires, which have been stoked across the West because of higher temperatures and greater aridity. Fires damaged some California wineries in recent years, and the smoke, if dense and persistent enough, can permeate the berry and alter its flavor.
"There's no question there's more for us to think about these days," Clair says.
In search of cooler zones
Ultimately, consumers might need to train their palates to appreciate new wine varietals.
"People can't expect to buy the same product year in and year out and not expect change," says Gregory Jones, a wine industry authority and director of the Evenstad Center for Wine Education at Linfield College in McMinnville, Oregon. "As climate change evolves, consumers need to embrace the newness of what might come."
Jones notes that of the 5,000 known grape varietals, only about 20 are produced worldwide, leaving thousands of others to experiment with.
"I'm optimistic because there's a lot of adaptive capability in this industry," says Jones, who addressed a gathering of wine experts in Sweden, where cooler-climate wine production was explored. "But I am pessimistic because at some point, the climate will be too warm for certain things, wine or otherwise. So being proactive is a big piece of this."
Ria D'Aversa, director of ranch operations at McEvoy Ranch, says climate change is "keeping us all on our toes."
McEvoy, which produces wine and olive oil, is  in the Petaluma Gap, an area north of Napa and Sonoma counties in California's wine country and much closer to the cooling breezes and frequent fog generated off the Pacific Ocean.
For years, McEvoy has produced pinot noir that benefited from those temperature-reducing winds, but lately, "it's been getting extremely hot, which means we have to think, what should be the next step?" D'Aversa says.
That could mean experimenting with new varietals that can cope with temperature swings, or buying land higher up in the gap to hedge against temperature spikes. "We just have to deal with the ups and downs more," D'Aversa says. "With Mother Nature, you don't have control."
S. Kaan Kurtural is a viticulture expert at the University of California-Davis, a center for wine science. He says the way the climate has affected the industry over the past few years has "shocked me. It's not going to be business as usual."
He's conducting an experiment with Napa's Beckstoffer Vineyards that involves planting 3,600 Cabernet plants made up of 100 different rootstock and clone combinations. The idea is for Kurtural  to spend the next eight years making wine from this plot to see whether some of the experimental crop proves more heat- or drought-resistant.
"Anyone who farms anything has known that the climate has been shifting for a while, but now there's an economic necessity to take action," Kurtural says. "We're looking to the future."
At Larkmead Vineyards in Napa Valley, winemaker Dan Petroski has no interest in waiting to see what the future holds. "It's all happening quicker than we thought, and I have a fiduciary responsibility to the owners of this winery to see where this business is going," he says.
Given that Larkmead is known for Cabernet wines that can sell for more than $350 a bottle, he is eager to see what grapes can be developed that could be used to blend with Cabernet to cut any heat-induced acidity while maintaining the label's signature flavor.
To that end, he's getting ready to plant an experimental 3-acre parcel with more heat-resistant varietals at a cost of $75,000. It's a gamble, but one he says he has to take.
One family's dream at risk
About 6 miles south of Larkmead Vineyards, Spottswoode winemaker Aron Weinkauf walks through the rows of deep purple Cabernet grapes that are responsible for the winery's burnished reputation. It's 100 degrees in the shade.
Weinkauf points out how the winery hopes to hedge against the effects of warming temperature. He motions to the long mesh canopies that line the rows of grapes, designed to cut back on the intensity of the sun rays and  help the grapes ripen more slowly.
Next, he runs his hand across the grass at the base of the dry, thick vines, the so-called cover crop that helps the soil retain moisture or, in the case of heavy rains, can be cut back to allow better evaporation.
High-tech gauges  dot the vineyards, all related to detecting the percentage of moisture in the air  to more efficiently conserve the water that drips on each vine stalk through small emitters.
Lastly, he points out small, recent plantings that could represent the future of Spottswoode, new grape varietals that will be given a chance to react to temperature swings and spikes.
"With what we've been seeing, we simply have to have more tools in our toolbox," Weinkauf says. "We have one crop. The stakes are high."

Democrats will push on climate change; Policies could carry risk for leaders of new House

WASHINGTON - Capitol Hill Democrats who soon will run the House of Representatives are prioritizing climate change nearly a decade after their attempts to slow global warming helped whisk them out of power.
Party leaders vowed to hold hearings on President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to undo Obama-era climate rules and demanded internal documents on administration decisions to scale back restrictions on fossil fuels that contribute to global warming.
Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who is vying to regain her role as House speaker, said she planned to revive a special congressional panel designed to examine climate change. The Select Committee on Energy Independence & Global Warming was shelved after Republicans took over the House in 2010.
That urgency grew after the release Friday of a dire government report that climate change poses an increasing risk to the planet in the form of extreme weather, worsening health conditions, the spread of new diseases, increasing drought and famine and economic decline.
Trump said Monday that he's not buying the National Climate Assessment's warning that the effects of global warming could reduce the nation's GDP by as much as 10 percent by 2100.
"I don't believe it," he said when asked about the conclusions of the report, which was written by dozens of top scientists from 13 federal agencies in the Trump administration.
Though they won back the House during the midterm elections by campaigning largely on health care, Democrats got the backing of environmental groups that poured tens of millions of dollars into their campaigns and registered liberal voters.
The quandary for the party leaders when they take back power Jan. 3 is how aggressively to pursue an issue that contributed to the tea party wave that fueled the Republican takeover of the House in 2010. How prepared are they to address  arguments that "alarmist" climate change policies would  increase energy prices and reduce consumer choice? How willing are they to take on a president who was elected  two years ago on an America First platform that promised to "bring back coal" as part of an energy independence agenda?
For now, Democrats are content to build a case through fierce congressional oversight and the power to subpoena administration records, knowing that any major legislation they could pass probably would be vetoed by the president even if it got past the Republican-controlled Senate.
Lawmakers led by incoming Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone, D-N.J., demanded documents related to Environmental Protection Agency proposals to let states regulate their power plants, freeze fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks and roll back requirements on the power industry to check and repair methane leaks.
"The tragic and human and financial costs of unchecked climate change are high and increasing fast, and unfortunately the administration's actions for the last two years are only exacerbating these conditions," Pallone wrote in a letter Nov. 20 to EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler.
The emphasis on climate change - which Trump has labeled a "hoax" perpetrated by China - comes amid a cascade of scientific reports, including from the United Nations, that portend catastrophic social, economic and environmental consequences within decades if global temperatures keep rising.
Effects are already being felt through stronger hurricanes, more intense wildfires, melting glaciers and loss of habitat, researchers say.
The Trump administration has made expansion of fossil fuels, including more offshore oil and gas drilling and mining, a centerpiece of its energy and economic agenda. The president also pushed to undo Obama-era steps aimed at addressing climate change: proposing a new Clean Power Plan rule to give states more authority to regulate the industry; recommending a freeze on mile-per-gallon standards for cars and light trucks after the 2020 model year; and withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, the international accord to gradually reduce emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.
"This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States," Trump said June 1, 2017, when he announced the withdrawal from the Paris accord.
An EPA spokeswoman  said the agency was reviewing Pallone's letter.
David Doniger, a climate change expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said forcing records into the light of day could pressure the EPA to withdraw rules or Congress to pass laws if they show the agency selectively used information or improperly skewed cost-benefits analyses to favor the fossil fuels industry.
"It's always important to know ... more about the real influence and the real reasons and the real beneficiaries of these decisions," he said. "The public has a right to know that."
Pelosi was speaker in 2009 when the chamber narrowly passed a "cap and trade" bill to address climate change. Portrayed by opponents as little more than an energy tax that would hit consumers' wallets, the measure never came up for a vote in the Democratic-controlled Senate and helped fuel the tea party wave that propelled Republicans to take control of the House in 2010.
Some House Democrats are content with modest efforts to address global warming.
"It's going to be, I think, more of an opportunistic strategy, where, in various pieces of legislation across the board, we're going to insert measures that address climate change," Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., co-chairman of the House Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, told The Hill newspaper.
Even if  the House did pass an aggressive plan, it's doubtful the GOP-controlled Senate would take it up.

Summit wheel-spinning; Dealing with climate change isn't a matter of will power; it's a matter of economics. Next week's meeting in Cancun should focus on real solutions.

In a week's time, several thousand well-meaning officials from 194 countries will gather in Cancun, Mexico, for yet another global climate summit. And just as they did last year in Copenhagen,  and the year before in Poznan, Poland,  and in fact every year since 1995  in a variety of locales from Kyoto, Japan,  to Marrakech, Morocco,  they will fill the air with apocalyptic warnings about what will happen to the planet if we don't cut carbon emissions drastically. After that, they will go home, once again having done nothing meaningful about global warming.
Why do we keep running in fruitless circles when it comes to climate change? Most climate activists will tell you it's the result of a failure of will. If we had the requisite backbone, they insist, we'd simply stop pumping millions of tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere each year as a result of our addiction to fossil fuels such as coal and oil. Since we obviously don't, they argue, we need to find some mechanism, such as imposing hefty carbon taxes, that would effectively force us to do the right thing.
Why fossil fuels?
This notion is attractively simple, but it ignores a fundamental reality. The reason we continue to use fossil fuels is not because we're weak or lazy or enjoy annoying Al Gore. Rather, it's a matter of basic economics. As energy sources go, fossil fuels are much cheaper and more efficient than any of the green alternatives such as solar or wind power. And even as hard a climate hard-liner as James Hansen of NASA concedes, "As long as fossil fuels are the cheapest form of energy, they are going to continue to be used."
This is why developing nations such as China and India are so resistant to the idea of drastically cutting their carbon emissions.  And it's why the developed world has found it impossible to live up to any of the grand carbon-cutting promises made over the past two decades at climate summits in Rio, Kyoto, and most recently Copenhagen. It's not that Third World governments don't understand the link between greenhouse gases and global warming; it's that without the cheap energy that fossil fuels provide, there is absolutely no way they will be able to lift billions of their citizens out of poverty. And it's not that we in the West don't get the climate equation either; it's that very few of us are willing to suffer higher prices and slower economic growth.
Fortunately, there is a way out of this impasse. Instead of trying to solve global warming by making fossil fuels cost more, why not concentrate on making the green alternatives cost less? If we could make solar and wind and other green energy technologies competitive with coal and oil, no one would have to be compelled to do anything -- everyone would switch over in a heartbeat.
How do we bring down the cost of green energy? Think about the last great technological revolution that changed the world -- the digital one. We didn't promote the scientific breakthroughs that wound up putting PCs in hundreds of millions of homes by making slide rules and typewriters more expensive. Rather, it was the result of massive investments in research and development in areas such as solid-state physics and computer science. Why aren't we doing the same with green energy technologies?
Taken as a whole, the nations of the world spend a paltry $2 billion a year on green energy R&D.  As a result, these technologies are progressing at a snail's pace. We can (and should) do  better. But it will take a real commitment -- something on the order of roughly $100 billion a year (or roughly 0.2% of global GDP) to produce the kind of game-changing breakthroughs that ushered in the digital revolution.
'Transform our world'
All kinds of exciting technologies could benefit from this sort of investment -- everything from artificial photosynthesis (which would enable us to store solar energy cheaply and efficiently) to fourth-generation nuclear reactors (which would consume existing nuclear waste) -- any one of which could change our future for the better.
In the end, most of these bets probably won't pay off, but all we need to transform our world is for a few of them to work.  But to do that, we first need to recognize that solving global warming isn't a matter of backbone -- it's a matter of economics.

Why the extreme weather?; Could it be acts of nature? Or are humans and climate change the culprit? Science is not certain, but we're rolling the dice in a very serious game.

Did humans contribute to the record heat of March and the strength of April's tornadoes across much of the U.S.? Science still says, "Maybe, maybe not." But we're rolling the dice in a serious game where the "jackpot" means we lose.
There's very high scientific confidence that our fossil-fuel burning and other activities, which add carbon dioxide to the air, are turning up the planet's thermostat. In a warmer world, we expect more record highs and heat waves but fewer record lows, just as we're observing. Warmer air can carry more water vapor, so a warmer rainstorm can deliver more inches per hour. Hair dryers have a "hot" setting for good reasons, and warmer air between rainstorms can dry out the ground faster.
Thus, we expect rising CO2 to bring more floods in some places and more droughts in others, with some places getting more of both. That might seem contradictory, but it's not. And with more energy to drive hurricanes, the peak winds may increase, even if the number of storms drops.
But couldn't nature have caused the ongoing changes without our help? Imagine playing dice with a shady character. Suppose, after you lose, you discover that some of the corners are filed off and there are carefully positioned weights inside. In court, your lawyer could say, "The dice were loaded, double-sixes came up three times in a row, so the defendant owes restitution."
His lawyer, however, might counter, "My client doesn't recall where he got the dice, the modifications are really quite small, dice games are inherently variable, anomalous events do happen, so my client is innocent and should get to keep all the money plus the plaintiff's wallet."
Loaded odds
Out in the climate, the dice are being loaded to favor some unusual events. We can't prove that global warming caused any single new record, just as we can't prove that the weighted dice caused a run of double-sixes. But for many extreme weather events such as record heat, it is much harder to prove that our CO2 is innocent, just as it is very hard to prove that loaded dice didn't affect the game.
Science doesn't have a good understanding of warming's impact on the occurrence and strength of small, fierce storms such as tornadoes, so it would be very difficult to show a human fingerprint in the severity of the recent outbreaks. But extra heat and water vapor are up there, so it could be harder to show that we haven't boosted the destructive power.
More important, if we continue to burn fossil fuels and release the CO2 to the air, we're loading the dice more and more. For any "business as usual" scenario, the coming changes are projected to be much bigger than those that have occurred so far. Today's youngsters might live to see so much warming that the hottest summer now on record becomes commonplace or even cool in many places.
But here's the difference between dice and climate, between Earth and Las Vegas. Even if gamblers avoid shady dice games and play at a state lottery or a licensed casino, many do lose money, but they can quit while they still have bus fare, and there's a slight chance of striking it rich. We expect the climate changes from our CO2 to be costly, but we can limit those costs by including the best science in our planning, leaving us with much more than bus fare, and pointing to a sustainable and prosperous future.
Race against time
Unfortunately, if three rotten cherries come up on the climate slot machine before we master sustainable energy, we could lose the jackpot. Science hasn't found a plausible way for rapidly rising CO2 to turn Earth into Eden, but there is at least a slight chance of a rapidly collapsing ice sheet flooding the coasts, or widespread droughts and heat stress risking famine, or other very large problems.
Much of my research, and that of many colleagues, has been devoted to replacing these worrisome "what if's" with hard numbers. And in some cases, the worries have grown smaller as we learned more. But in other cases, the worries are still there and might even be bigger.
Even so, the best science is clear. We get many benefits from burning fossil fuels, but the CO2 is projected to change the climate in costly ways. As the easy fossil fuels are exhausted, more and more we will want sustainable alternatives.
Careful lottery players check the jackpot and their cash reserves before buying the next ticket. But though the scientific community is working to calculate the odds in the climate game, society is still rolling the increasingly loaded dice through accelerating fossil-fuel burning.
It could make you wonder who the real gamblers are.

Human-caused climate change is worsening the wildfires scorching Australia, experts say.
"Climate change is increasing bushfire risk in Australia by lengthening the fire season, decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature," according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.
The unprecedented fires, which have killed at least 25 people and destroyed 2,000 homes, have been burning since September. In all, about 15 million acres have burned across the country, an area roughly the size of West Virginia.
While climate change might not ignite the fires, it is giving them the chance to turn into catastrophic blazes by creating warmer temperatures, increasing the amount of fuel (dried vegetation) available and reducing water availability because of higher evaporation, according to Climate Signals.
"There are many drivers of wildfires, but its increasingly clear that hotter, drier conditions play a big role in making them worse," said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a climate research organization.
"Southern Australia has seen rapid warming of around 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1950, making conditions ripe for devastating fires," he said.
Recent extremely hot, dry conditions have also fueled the fires. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, 2019 was both the hottest and driest year ever measured in Australia.
"Under these conditions, it is not at all surprising that extreme wildfires have been running out of control," said Robert Rohde, a lead scientist at Berkeley Earth, in a tweet.
December was particularly harsh in Australia: It was one of the top two hottest months on record for the nation.
"Australia has warmed by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) since records began in 1910," tweeted Columbia University climate scientist Kate Marvel. "This makes heat waves and fires more likely. It's not the sun. It's not volcanoes. It's not 'natural cycles.'"
"There is no explanation for this - none - that makes sense besides emissions of heat-trapping gases," Marvel said.
Climate change also is making droughts more likely to occur - and more severe when they do - in Australia. While Australia is no stranger to drought, climate change has exacerbated drought conditions so that when droughts occur, the conditions are in a much hotter climate and, in some cases, with lower precipitation, according to Climate Signals.
The Climate Reality Project also reports that making the connection between global temperature rise and wildfires is also pretty simple science: Droughts dry out the land, killing plant life - which then also dries out itself, becoming far easier to ignite.
Indeed, winter rainfall has been decreasing in southeastern Australia, while the country has been becoming hotter with more extreme heatwaves - ideal conditions for bushfires.
"If anyone tells you, 'This is part of a normal cycle' or 'we've had fires like this before,' smile politely and walk away, because they don't know what they're talking about," Greg Mullins, former Fire and Rescue commissioner of New South Wales, told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Lockdowns not enough to slow climate change

With the coronavirus pandemic  shutting down most global activity, a consequent crash in global carbon emissions has been widely reported.
While analysts agree the historic lockdowns will significantly lower emissions, some environmentalists argue the drop is nowhere near enough.
"Hey so it turns out that the people of earth accidentally did a global experiment to see if every individual could course correct climate change through mass personal change of habits, and it turns out, no! We can't!," a Facebook post shared more than 4,000 times reads.
While there have been observed drops in carbon emissions, these declines are not expected to have a significant impact on the trajectory of the climate in the coming years, experts say. The reductions are also likely to be short-lived.
Projections for 2020  emissions
Analyses are nearly universal in finding that global carbon emissions will decline from the record peak in 2019. The declines, largely driven by a steep reduction in vehicle emissions, have been so large that photographs from space reflected the change.
The International Energy Agency, a policy advisory group to 30 member countries, projects that global carbon emissions are set to fall by 8%, or levels the world hasn't seen for a decade.
Estimates of the full drop in carbon emissions vary as analysts adjust their models around the coronavirus pandemic, but the lowest estimates still expect about a 5% drop in emissions.
"This may sound small at first, but it is the largest drop since World War II, as emissions have generally increased year-over-year, even during recessions," Ankur Desai, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told USA TODAY. Desai said the drop is attributable to  commercial travel and business operations; a larger decline wasn't recorded because "much of the economy is still going on," including manufacturing, shipping and food production.
Despite the drop, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has said 2020 is already the second-warmest year on record and  has a 75%  chance of being the hottest ever.
"Our findings show that the annual average CO2 concentrations will still increase through this year, even though emissions are reducing," a team from the United Kingdom's National Weather Service said in a recent study, adding "This means that, although global emissions are smaller, they are still continuing - just at a slower rate."
"The reported drops in carbon emissions and other greenhouse gases, while helpful, are insufficient to slow climate change," Alex Hall, a professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at UCLA, told USA TODAY.
Because changes in the climate are the result of decades of accumulating greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, one year of slightly falling emissions will not counter long-term effects, Hall said.
"Those emissions took place over  the past several decades," he said. "To affect ongoing and future climate change, the recent emissions drop would have to be sustained over a much longer period than the likely duration of the coronavirus outbreak."
The  drop in emissions is  not yet detectable in total carbon dioxide concentrations, according to Benjamin Houlton, a professor of environmental science at University of California-Davis. "The challenge is that carbon dioxide has an average lifespan of around 100 years in the atmosphere," he told USA TODAY.
Emissions would need to drop by more than 25% to see a total drop in the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, and thus slow an annual global rise in temperatures, Houlton said.
"There isn't a scenario where global concentrations of CO2 do not increase this year," Rob Jackson, a professor of earth systems at Stanford University, told USA TODAY.
"If we had a magic wand that would stop all emissions from today forward, it would still take decades for the atmospheric concentrations to return to normal," he said.
Our ruling: True
Though it is unclear how large carbon emission reductions will be for 2020, it is certain that the overall amount of carbon in the atmosphere will increase. Emissions have not fallen significantly enough to remedy any of the impacts on the climate, and current drops are unlikely to continue. We rate this claim TRUE because it is supported by our research.

Clinton, Trump show stark contrast on climate change; Dem's warning of major crisis derided by GOP candidate as radical

Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump offer Americans starkly different views on global warming: Clinton says it is an urgent concern. Trump dismisses it as a minor problem.
"There's never been a bigger contrast between the two candidates and the two platforms," said Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president of the League of Conservation Voters.
The Trump campaign decried Clinton's policy proposals  Tuesday as an "extreme, reckless anti-energy agenda ... to appease radical donors (who) will destroy millions of jobs and force millions more into abject poverty."
The GOP nominee said nothing about climate change in his acceptance speech July 21 at the Republican National Convention. He told a rally in South Carolina in December that global warming was "a hoax, a lot of it," a modest change from a tweet in 2013 that called global warming "bulls---."
He's rejected climate science even though climate is  thoroughly researched, said Jeremy Symons of the Environmental Defense Action Fund.
"Climate change is real," the Democratic nominee said in her acceptance speech Thursday. Clinton said she was proud the United States had signed a climate accord in Paris that commits the world's nations to slow the rise of greenhouse gases blamed for warming the climate.
Clinton "cares deeply about protecting public health and the environment," Sittenfeld said
The gap between presidential candidates has grown since the 2008 election, when GOP nominee John McCain expressed concern about climate change, said Kevin Curtis, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council Action Fund.
Clinton's campaign website has more than 30 pages of proposals for fighting climate change. They include installing a half-billion solar panels by the end of her term and ensuring that every U.S. home is powered by renewable energy within 10 years.
Those goals are "ambitious," Curtis said. "And we think that's great. If she's elected, we'll be badgering her to do more."
Trump has promised to slash funding for the Environmental Protection Agency. Last week, he was asked on Fox News if global warming was caused by human activity. "It could have a minor impact," Trump said. "But nothing, nothing to what they're talking about."
The Sierra Club issued a paper July 12 saying that if elected, Trump would be the only world leader who did not believe in the science of climate change.
"Leaders of all nations accept the scientific consensus that man is fueling climate change by burning fossil fuels and are calling for urgent action," the report states. Support comes from leaders of 195 countries, including North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.
"We wanted to be very clear about where Donald Trump ranks among other world leaders, and he's at the very bottom," said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club.
Trump spokesman Jason Miller said  the Sierra Club "lobbies for the closure of American coal mines and celebrates the loss of countless, good-paying energy jobs for American workers."
The platforms adopted by the Republican and Democratic Parties underscore the candidates' glaring differences.
The Republicans emphasize American energy independence. Their platform advocates reviving construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would bring crude oil from Canada to Nebraska, and killing an EPA plan to reduce power plant emissions. It seeks to take regulatory control away from the federal government and give it to the states.
Though the party encourages the development of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, it says it should be done entirely by private capital. It says coal is clean, an assertion that rankles environmentalists.
"It is a fantasy and wishful thinking," Symons said. "Coal kills thousands of people a year."
The Democratic platform says climate change "is an urgent threat and a defining challenge of our time" and takes dire note of rising seas, brutal drought, "superstorms" and multiplying wildfires. It argues that embracing clean energy technology will create "millions of new jobs" and cut home and business expenses.
"It's the most pro-environment platform we've ever seen," Sittenfeld said.
The libertarian Cato Institute calls the Democratic platform "chock full of government actions that promise to initiate, broaden and extend the current set of rules, regulations and orders seeking to reduce ... our reliance on fossil fuels as our primary source of energy production."
"A Democratic administration will seek a further expansion of the reach of the federal government into our daily lives," the institute said on its website.
Decades ago, Sittenfeld noted, environment issues enjoyed bipartisan support. The Clean Water Act of 1972 was passed with support from both parties and signed into law by President Richard Nixon, a Republican.
Whether the sharp divide between Trump and Clinton will move voters is unclear. Though the number of voters who say they believe in climate change has increased -- including 47% of conservatives -- the percentage "alarmed" by global warming is still small, said research scientist Anthony Leiserowitz, director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.
"American engagement with this issue is at levels that we haven't seen since the latest high water mark in 2008," he said.

ExxonMobil investigated for climate change statements; Subpoena questions whether energy giant deceived public, investors

ExxonMobil is under investigation by New York's top law enforcement officer about whether it lied to investors and the public about the risks and financial impact of climate change.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman subpoenaed the firm Wednesday, seeking financial records, statements and other climate-change-related material dating to 1977, according to a government official with direct knowledge of the matter. The official discussed the issue on condition of anonymity because the subpoena and other details of the investigation remain secret.
"Exxon Mobil has included information about the business risk of climate change for many years in our 10-K, Corporate Citizenship Report and in other reports to shareholders," ExxonMobil said  in response to questions about the subpoena, which was first reported by The New York Times.
The company's 10-K annual report for the 2014 fiscal year stated many countries are considering regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions "due to concern over the risk of climate change."
"These requirements could make our products more expensive, lengthen project implementation times and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural gas" it warned, adding that new rules "may also increase our compliance costs."
The broad investigation by Schneiderman's office focuses on whether ExxonMobil made timely and accurate disclosures about how its climate-change research, the impact of long-term environmental shifts and any movement away from usage of fossil fuels could have on the company's financial fortunes.
New York's Martin Act gives the state's attorney general broad authority to investigate suspected financial wrongdoing and how it could affect investors.
Material sought by the  subpoena includes research reports showing potential causes of climate change and documents detailing how the company made business decisions and financial projections based on environmental projections, according to the official. Additionally, the subpoena seeks information about ExxonMobil's funding of organizations involved in climate-change research, including those that challenged climate science findings. Schneiderman's office also sought promotional materials, advertisements and flyers, as well as the firm's disclosures in Securities and Exchange Commission filings and other statements to investors.
Investigators plan to examine whether ExxonMobil's internal research and findings square with what the company told investors and the public.
The energy giant is the second major company under investigation by Schneiderman over climate-change statements. Peabody Energy  the world's largest private-sector coal producer, turned over documents in response to a 2013 request, and disclosed the issue the following year, the official  said.
"Peabody continues to work with the New York Attorney General's office regarding our disclosures, which have evolved over the years," spokesman Vic Svecsaid in a statement the firm issued Thursday.

Climate change could spur immigration from Mexico; Crop-crippling drought may drive people north across American border

The number of people moving from Mexico to the USA has dropped sharply over the past decade. But researchers said a new force could drive more people across the U.S.-Mexican border in the coming decades: climate change.
As global temperatures climb, dry regions have become more susceptible to drought. That includes northern Mexico, where increasingly intense dry spells are likely to reduce crop yields in  agriculture-dependent areas, potentially giving people more reason to seek better opportunities in the USA.
Researchers who study the link between global warming and migration said many factors contribute to a person or family's decision to move to another country, climate change often playing a supporting role. Several studies have singled out climate change as a potentially significant driver of U.S.-Mexican migration.
"It's never any one thing that causes people to move," said Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton University climate scientist who's researched climate-driven migration. "But we have a lot of evidence from many different countries that relatively modest variations in the climate, that could be short-term or long-term, do cause people to move."
It's hard to say how many people could be pushed across the U.S.-Mexican border by climate change.
A study in 2010 co-authored by Oppenheimer found that up to 6.7 million people could come to the USA from Mexico as a result of global warming by 2080. A study in 2016 from researchers at the University of California-Davis projected 41,000 additional immigrants over the next 50 years as a result of climate change.
What those studies and others have in common is a finding that high temperatures and reduced rainfall -- conditions that are becoming more common -- have contributed to waves of migration from Mexico to the USA.
"More hot days in rural Mexico will increase migration out of rural Mexico, including to the U.S.," said Ed Taylor, a development economist at UC-Davis and co-author of the  study in 2016.
Valerie Mueller, a development economist at Arizona State University,  said there's a general consensus that rising temperatures have contributed to people moving away from rural, agricultural areas in developing countries -- usually to other rural areas and cities within their own countries but sometimes across national borders.
"A lot of it is being driven either by vulnerability to crop loss or wage laborers losing their jobs because farmers can no long afford to hire them," Mueller said.
Mueller said  more people moving from Mexico to the USA could be a good thing economically. Farmers in California's Central Valley have faced a shortage of laborers as legal and illegal immigration from Mexico has declined.
Mueller said it's not clear how much of a difference climate change will make to overall migration levels, considering the relatively low number of immigrants from Mexico in the past few years.
In 2015, the Pew Research Center reported that since the end of the Great Recession, more Mexicans had left the USA than had moved here. Analysts attributed that drop to several factors, including improved economic conditions in Mexico relative to the USA, lower birth rates in Mexico and tougher enforcement of U.S. immigration laws under President Obama.
In light of climate change, Mueller said, "it's not so clear whether these increases in immigration flows are going to lead to a mass exodus of people into the United States."
Susan Martin, an emeritus professor at Georgetown University and an expert in international migration,  said any climate-driven migration from Mexico  would be relatively small. She said the Mexican government has improved its social safety net, giving agricultural areas greater insurance against the risk of  crop losses. She said the USA may be more likely to see climate-driven migration from Central America, where more extreme weather adds to the instability created by violence and poverty.

Climate change can make you sick; Warmer, drier weather is spreading serious ailments and claiming more victims

Software engineer Andres Chavez is used to doing things quickly, efficiently and correctly. So he knew something was seriously wrong when, on a business trip in 2009, he was so confused he could barely sign a stack of paperwork.
"I felt like I was living a quarter-second in the past," he says of the onset of Valley Fever, a disease caused by a soil fungus. It took months for his doctor to suggest that might be the cause of Chavez's episodes of "getting stupid," as his wife calls it.
"He called and asked me if I spent any time down in the Central Valley, and I said of course I did, my family lives in Livingston, Calif.," Chavez, 43, remembers.
The soil there and in much of the arid Southwest carries the Coccidioides fungus. In dry months, the dust scatters in the wind and can be breathed into the lungs, infecting humans, dogs, cats and other mammals. The incidence is rising dramatically in the Southwest, where reported cases increased tenfold from 1998 to 2011, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Valley Fever is one of multiple diseases experts say are spreading in part because of climate change. They include a brain-eating amoeba showing up in northern lakes that were once too cold to harbor it and several illnesses carried by ticks whose range is increasing. USA TODAY is looking at the spread of these illnesses as part of a year-long series that explores the places and ways in which climate change affects us.
Chavez's diagnosis led him to the office of George Thompson, an infectious disease specialist who devotes two clinics a week to Valley Fever patients at the University of California-Davis Medical Center in Sacramento.
Almost fully recovered, Chavez still has occasional headaches and bouts of confusion caused by the fungus that invaded his body. In the clinic, Thompson inspected Chavez's hands, knees and ankles. "We worry about your joints with cocci," he said, calling the disease by the short form of its medical name, coccidioidomycosis (cock-sih-dee-oy-doh-my-CO- sis).
Each year, more than 150,000 people in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas and Utah are infected, and Arizona and California have the most cases, according to the CDC. The incidence of laboratory-confirmed cases rose from 2,265 in 1998 to more than 22,000 in 2011.
About 60% of those infected have no symptoms and never know they have it. An additional 35% have symptoms of fatigue and weight loss and typically miss "a few weeks to a few months of work" but get better, Thompson says. In about 5% of cases, the most extreme, the fungus finds its way into the bones, the brain or the skin, while other people fail to ever clear the organism from their lungs.
For those with the most severe form of the disease, it can be a lifelong illness. Cheryl Rinn, 72, is one of Thompson's patients. The fungus invaded her brain, caused a stroke and left her in a wheelchair, paralyzed on her left side.  The former labor and delivery nurse had to move from her home in Lincoln, Calif., to an assisted living facility in Seattle to be near her daughter. "They told me I had lung cancer with brain metastases (sites where the tumor has spread). We were at our wits' end," she says. As is the case with many patients, it took months to get the proper diagnosis. By then, the damage had been done.
Valley Fever is an illness that's moving. Historically, it has been found in the dry areas of California and the Southwest. But Thompson, along with the CDC, reported three cases of cocci in eastern Washington state in 2012.
BRAIN-EATING AMOEBA
The same is true of Naegleria fowleri, "the brain-eating amoeba." It is commonly found in freshwater lakes and rivers, though human infections are rare. They tend to occur in areas where waters warm in the summer. Minnesota had its first ever infection in 2010, 550 miles farther north than an infection had ever been seen before.
Another shift is tick season in the Midwest, which is starting earlier and ending later. This year seems to be one of the worst, says Mary Anne Jackson, director of the infectious disease division at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Mo. Ticks carry multiple diseases, but ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever are the ones she sees most.
Ehrlichiosis is a bacterial disease often called "summer flu" by doctors. "Now it can occur any time of year," Jackson says. "I've been here since 1984, and this feels like one of the biggest tick years we've had, with the most children we've had admitted to the hospital."
Three trends contribute to the nation's changing disease map, experts say. The first is overall warming, which makes new areas hospitable to the animals and bugs that can carry disease. The second involves increased extreme weather events such as drought, rainstorms and flooding, which create situations where diseases and insects that carry them can flourish. Finally, Americans are increasingly moving to areas close to wilderness, where they are more exposed to these disease-carrying creatures.
It's impossible to say what specifically causes any single illness. But the overall patterns are clear: Where and when certain diseases strike is changing, and those changes are being affected by the warming, increasingly erratic climate.
One striking example is the movement of the black-legged tick. People in the Northeast got used to doing tick-checks of themselves and their children in the 1970s as word spread that ticks carried Lyme disease. These unpleasant bloodsucking parasites are spreading north, south and west, says Richard Ostfeld, a disease ecologist and Lyme expert at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y.
To the north, climate change is making areas of Vermont, Maine and northern New Hampshire and New York suitable for ticks "where they never occurred in recorded history," he says. In the past, these areas got too cold.
In general, temperatures are rising more quickly across the northern USA, according to a draft of the National Climate Assessment released in 2013.
From 1895 to 2011, according to the assessment, temperatures in the Northeast increased by almost 2 degrees.
The biting arachnids are actually resettling areas our ancestors pushed them out of more than 200 years ago when forests were cleared for farmland.  Farms in New England and the upper Midwest were  abandoned when other parts of the country opened to farming. That meant  forests began to regrow, bringing back  mice and deer and the diseases they carry.
The best known is Lyme, a bacterial illness whose symptoms can include fever, headache and fatigue. Untreated, the infection can travel to the joints, heart and nervous system. Lyme is not the only tick-borne disease. The insects also transmit a range of lesser-known illnesses that more Americans may soon become familiar with. They include anaplasmosis, babesiosis, borrelia miyamotoi and Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness, or STARI.
PLAYING DEFENSE
Valley Fever infects more than 150,000 people a year, according to the CDC. Part of that increase is due to better testing, part to a doubling of population in the area affected by the disease, says Andrew Comrie, a professor of geography at the University of Arizona who has studied Valley Fever extensively.
An erratic weather pattern Comrie has dubbed "grow and blow" also plays a role.
Wetter conditions in the fall and winter allow the fungus to flourish and grow, followed by dry conditions in the summer that dry it out so it can blow in the wind.
No one is saying the Earth is likely to be swept by a new plague that will kill everyone off because of climate change. Nor is climate change the only reason diseases are spreading. But "it's clear that environment change, including climate change, is affecting these populations," says Charles Chiu, director of the viral diagnostics and discovery center at the University of California-San Francisco.
The good news is that the robust public health system in the USA will protect people from some of those changes, says Sonia Altizer, a professor of ecology at the University of Georgia-Athens and co-author of a recent paper in the journal Science on how climate change affects infectious diseases worldwide.
The bad news is "it's going to cost us more money," she says. More mosquito abatement, more deer fences, more vaccination campaigns, more public health clinics, higher medical insurance costs. It all adds up.
"We really have to ask ourselves," she says, "how much harder we'll have to fight to keep diseases out of this country as the climate warms."

Coccidioides is a fungus that lives in the soil in the southwestern United States. It can cause a respiratory infection known as Valley Fever or "cocci."  Cases increased tenfold from 1998 to 2011.
1) Coccidioides exists as a mold in the desert environment.
2) If disturbed, the coccidioides spores can easily become airborne and inhaled.
3) When breathed into the lungs, the spores can cause a disease called Valley Fever.
WHERE DOES COCCIDIOIDES LIVE?
Coccidioides is found in the dust and soil of semi-arid areas in the southwestern United States, Mexico and South America.

Even as floodwaters raged this week in Texas and Louisiana, so did the debate over the possible link between Hurricane Harvey and man-made climate change.
Climate activists pointed to the historic rainfall and epic flooding as exactly the type of extreme event forecast to occur as the globe warms. Skeptics cited a long list of tropical storms that slammed Texas even before the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
So who's right?
In some ways, the question is premature, even unseemly, while search and rescue efforts continue. And a definitive answer won't come until scientists conduct post-storm "attribution" studies. In all likelihood, though, the conclusion will be that climate change didn't cause Harvey, but it almost surely made the storm worse.
Harvey produced 40- to 50-inch rainfall totals that left parts of Houston looking like Venice and rivaled snowfall accumulations from blizzards in the Northeast. It was, in fact, the most extreme rainfall event on the continental United States in recorded history.
Such events are consistent with the basic science of climate change: Warmer than normal water temperatures, in places such as the Gulf of Mexico, provide heat energy that fuels the formation and rapid strengthening of tropical storms. Warmer air holds more water vapor, which in turn produces more rainfall. And rising sea levels exacerbate storm surge and inland flooding.
According to the National Climate Assessment, "Heavy downpours are increasing nationally (in recent decades), with the largest increases in the Midwest and Northeast. Increases in extreme precipitation are projected for all U.S. regions."
This isn't just happening in North America.
Even as Harvey riveted the nation's attention this week, the death toll topped 1,000 from unusually severe monsoonal rains half a world away in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
In the coming days and weeks, expect to hear politicians describe Harvey as an "act of God" that had little or nothing to do with human-induced climate change. Even if climate change is real, they'll add, a serious effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions, through a carbon tax or other means, would be too expensive.
On Wednesday, the private company AccuWeather estimated that Harvey could end up costing $190 billion, making it the priciest natural disaster in U.S. history, equal to the combined cost of Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy.
With that kind of price tag atop a torrent of human misery, the question isn't whether the nation can afford to get serious about global warming. We can't afford not to.

In search of the next Big Fix to combat climate change

In the 1890s, New York City was swamped — not by a storm but something smellier, horse manure.
Horses, the primary mode of transportation, dropped more than a million pounds each day, causing a sanitation crisis. No one found a fix, and some estimated the streets would eventually be buried several feet deep.
Then, "shift happened," says Harvard chemist Daniel Nocera. The automobile arrived, and almost overnight, it replaced horses and cleaned up the streets. Hailed as an environmental savior, it solved a seemingly insurmountable problem.
What a difference a century makes. Cars are now known contributors to the modern-day scourge of climate change. Their heat-trapping emissions have helped warm the planet beyond its natural variability. So sea levels have risen, and drought, heat waves and hurricanes have intensified — as USA TODAY explored in a year-long series, "Weathering the Change."

As in the 1890s, society is once again looking for the Next Big Fix — whether high-altitude wind kites, "plug and play" nuclear reactors, giant synthetic trees to absorb carbon dioxide or sulfate aerosols to cool the planet. Next week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, two concepts will be on display: Toyota's hydrogen fuel-cell car, which emits no greenhouse gases, and Ford's hybrid, powered partly by renewable energy.
Yet will technology deliver this time? Or will inertia push the planet, already struggling with higher temperatures, to a cataclysmic breaking point?
"I'm totally optimistic," says Nocera, citing a plethora of technological advances, including his own "artificial leaf" for producing hydrogen fuel. "All over the world these things are happening." He says projections are based on current conditions but innovation can shift the paradigm, adding: "That's what discovery can do."
Even optimists agree it won't be easy. "No amount of new technology will magically solve the climate problem or even help much," unless there's broad consensus on the need for urgent action, says Harvard physicist David Keith.
In Washington, D.C., where climate change remains politically divisive, action is unlikely. Congress has rebuffed a tax on carbon emissions, which Keith and other climate scientists say would be the best way to spur clean-energy innovation. Opponents such as the American Petroleum Institute say the tax could boost energy prices and hurt the U.S. economy.
Global leaders have also made little progress in agreeing to cut greenhouse gas emissions, which continue to increase as rapidly developing nations such as India and China use coal to power economic growth.
Still, change is bubbling up. Dozens of states now require that a portion of their electricity come from renewable sources. In October, California became the first to require its utilities to install energy-storage equipment — expected to boost technologies such as batteries that can be used when the sun doesn't shine or the wind doesn't blow. China has increased its use of solar power to reduce the smog blanketing its major cities.
"The good news: We already know how to do a lot," says Jane Long, who's leading the California Council on Science and Technology's study on how the state can meet its pledge to slash emissions 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. Even so, she says breakthrough technologies, requiring a public and private partnership, will be needed to make fuels with nearly zero emissions.
There's not a lot of time to make changes, says climate scientist David Archer of the University of Chicago. He says research suggests dire changes could occur if the Earth warms 2 degrees Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) this century.
"We're halfway there," Archer says, adding the planet could reach that mark as soon as 2040 if carbon emissions continue their current climb. "This is just the fire alarm. This is not the fire," he says, adding it will become costlier to cut emissions the closer the flames come.
"It's important to recognize we don't know everything about climate change," Christopher Field told reporters last December at MIT's climate "boot camp." Yet Field, a senior fellow at Stanford University and co-author of research by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said enough is known to help society manage the risks and make smart investments.
The 19th-century horse-manure crisis suggests some solutions may beget new problems, says Eric Morris, an urban planning professor at Clemson University who studied that malodorous chapter of history. But he says it also offers another lesson: "Never discount the power of human ingenuity."
Here are six technologies — some old, some new — that might stem the worrisome warming trend:
1.Solar geo-engineering is sort of the Hail-Mary pass when attempts to cut carbon emissions don't go far enough. It includes blasting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight away from Earth or spraying fine sea salt into the sky to whiten clouds.
"They all act very fast. They're all cheap enough that money is not the issue and they're all inherently imperfect," says Keith, author of the 2013 book A Case for Climate Engineering. "The thing we most need to do is talk about it," he says, adding more research is needed on the effects and efficacy.
"One powerful country could do it by itself," if desperate enough for a quick but temporary fix," says climate scientist Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science. He notes how Mount Pinatubo's 1991 eruption in the Philippines, which fired sulfur particles high into the air, cooled global temperatures nearly one degree Fahrenheit in 1992 and 1993.
2. Carbon capture, which traps emissions from power plants and removes them the atmosphere, might obviate the need for such a drastic step.
Because of its current high cost, no commercial, coal-fired facility has yet to employ this technique. In May, the first effort is slated to debut in Kemper County, Miss; it's designed to capture 65% of carbon emissions. Earlier this year, MIT developed a simpler scrubbing system that it says can be added relatively easy to existing facilities.
The U.S. Department of Energy is funding research on how to capture industrial emissions and either store them underground or use them to make products such as fuel, plastics, cement and fertilizer. Without federal funds, Mark Herrema founded Newlight Technologies, a California-based company that captures methane emissions from dairy farms and uses them to make plastic.
Klaus Lackner, a Columbia University geophysicist, is working on synthetic trees that absorb carbon dioxide about a thousand times faster than natural trees. Keith's Calgary-based start-up, Carbon Engineering, funded partly by Bill Gates, is developing industrial-scale technologies to capture carbon from the atmosphere and use it to produce low-carbon transportation fuels.
3. Artificial photosynthesis could yield an entirely new, emissions-free energy source. In 2011, Nocera unveiled his "artificial leaf" — a credit-card-sized silicon solar wafer that, when placed in a glass of tap water and exposed to sunlight, generates hydrogen and oxygen bubbles that can be stored and — when needed — recombined in a fuel cell to generate electricity.
"We already know how to do this," Nocera says. The problem: His water-splitting device generates hydrogen fuel, but there's no network yet of hydrogen filling stations in the United States. So his start-up, Sun Catalytix, launched to develop the device, is now focusing instead on grid-scale flow batteries.
DOE is funding related research at the Joint Center for Artificial Photosynthesis, led by the California Institute of Technology. "The goal is to produce a chemical liquid fuel" that can replace gasoline, says spokesman William Royea, adding it will likely take a decade or so to reduce costs enough to make it commercially viable.
4. Solar and wind power have surged in recent years, and research is finding new applications. MIT and Sandia National Laboratories have developed ultralight, atom-thin solar cells that can be embedded in flexible products like drapes or harder structures like a tablet's outer shell to produce power. Similarly, they're developing transparent cells that can be placed on windows.
Companies such as California-based Makani, acquired this year by Google, are trying to harness power from high-altitude wind, which is faster and steadier. Their challenge: tethering airborne turbines hundreds of feet off the ground without interfering with aircraft. MIT researchers are looking at far-offshore wind turbines and, to store their power and anchor them, huge concrete spheres that sit on the seafloor.
"Storage will be the game changer" for solar and wind, because their power is intermittent but electric grids need consistency, says Bob Armstrong,director of the MIT Energy Initiative. So universities, start-ups and major companies are working to boost battery performance. Some advances debuted this year, including a battery by General Electric that's paired with a Texas wind farm to provide continuous power.
5. Nuclear power, disliked by many environmentalists because of safety and waste disposal concerns, is welcomed by climate scientists including James Hansen as a major energy source that doesn't emit carbon.
DOE has offered $8.3 billion in loan guarantees to help build a nuclear power plant in Georgia and is funding efforts by two companies — North Carolina-based Babcock & Wilcox and Oregon-based NuScale Power — to develop small modular reactors. These school bus-size versions of current light water reactors could be made in U.S. factories and moved from site to site. DOE says it expects commercial operation around 2025.
TerraPower, a start-up in Bellevue, Wash., that's partly funded by Bill Gates, is developing a larger, 500-megawatt, "traveling wave" reactor that runs on nuclear waste and can go 40 years without refueling. Last year, Gates said the company is looking to build a demonstration plant and "China is one possible place." This month, DOE posted a proposed agreement between an unnamed U.S. company and the Chinese government to develop such a reactor.
6. Efficiency is often seen as the invisible energy source, because it's energy not used. Though basic technology, its potential is huge. Long, who's studying California's efforts, estimates efficiency upgrades could halve the state's energy demand by 2050. Building practices such as superior insulation and air sealing have proven to slash a home's energy use up to 90%.
"This is the best way to get at climate mitigation," says David Gottfried, co-founder of the U.S. Green Building Council, a private non-profit group. Noting that residential and commercial buildings account for nearly 40% of total U.S. energy use, he says ultra-efficient buildings can essentially become "our power plants of the future."
IBM is working with cities, utilities and the federal government to boost efficiency by using sensors, meters and digital controls to monitor and automate how energy is used. The Obama administration is requiring new cars and light trucks to nearly double their fuel efficiency by 2025.

More costly to address climate change or ignore it? Your Say

In the State of the Union speech this week, President Obama challenged Congress to address climate change by passing legislation to reduce greenhouse gases.
PRICE OF DENIAL
Denying climate change will mean more taxes on the American people. Do you think that recovering from drought, more severe storms and hurricanes is free?
The longer the problem is ignored, the more expensive it will be to address later.
Climate change does not "cause" a particular storm, but it affects the probability of storms occurring and the intensity of such storms.
Tom Kane
How can man change the climate? There is  a natural order to the world. Drought, storms and hurricanes have been around longer than mankind. The cost of recovering from them is disaster relief.
Superstorm Sandy and Hurricane Katrina were prime examples of man being too stupid to understand that you shouldn't live in an area below sea level, essentially a  bowl, or build houses on barrier islands.
Bob Olson
MONEY GRAB
The issue is not about whether climate change is real or imagined; it's more about how much man has done or can do to affect that change, be it for better or worse.
Naturally occurring things such as volcanoes and livestock also pump  greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
Basically, I couldn't care less what is done to alter climate change because whatever is done will have so little effect as to be pointless. The only thing that concerns me is the government stepping in and using the opportunity to raise tax revenues under the guise of environmental protection, for example, carbon credits.
The government's role in this should be to set limits and guidelines. Anything else is just more pilferage from pockets that are getting shallower by the day.
Paul Hafner
Maybe people  don't like the idea of taxing polluting activities because  they haven't considered it as a market-based solution.
Polluting activities should be made less economically viable while cleaner alternatives should be subsidized.
If we don't do it, we shove the hidden costs off for future generations to pay.
The biosphere's habitability is not a limitless resource for us to plunder.
Phillip Noe
Will the next generation have to solve the national debt issue and global warming? Neither one is solvable. Not at this point.
And the debt is going to kill them off much much sooner than climate change.
Don Scotter
PROBLEM WITHOUT SOLUTION
You can do all you want here in the United States of America, but you're not going to change China and Third World countries.
William Antle
Climate change is occurring all the time with or with out humans on the planet.
Andrey Andre'y
Regardless of whether you believe it, the 30 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year will somehow have an effect.  That is common sense.
Steven Estes

Some communities in Minnesota are already making efforts to adapt to climate change through moves designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions.
The Water Resources Center at the University of Minnesota held a conference Thursday to foster a discussion among government officials, academics and others. Participants planned to brainstorm ways the state can adapt to climate change, including the creation of a greater capacity for stormwater and cooling zones for heat waves.
"It took a long time for enough people to understand that there really was an issue," WRC interim director Faye Sleeper said of global climate change.
Experts have noted increased temperatures and more frequent big rain events in Minnesota, according to Minnesota Public Radio News. Climate scientists expect those trends to continue.
Some cities are combating changes by using precipitation data to ensure roads and stormwater systems are prepared to handle heavier rainfall.
Some forest managers are looking into tree species that are more resilient when the climate changes.
Although farmers have a history of responding to year-to-year weather changes, some are now advocating a more diverse agricultural landscape. That's one of the best ways to respond to a changing climate, according to UM researcher Nick Jordan. Experts need to determine which crops best benefit soil by boosting organic material, while also allowing farmers to make money, he said.
"We have not had a business model to really move that kind of climate-smart agriculture forward," Jordan said.
Homeowners can also make changes that will help them and the environment, according to Paul Moss, who oversees climate adaptation efforts at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.
"For example, look at planting trees near your home," Moss said. "Trees can help cool your home when we're having hot weather. Also, trees can help intercept heavy precipitation and break the fall of the rain as well as absorb and purify the rain."

Heat waves, floods and other extreme weather worsen with global warming, suggests a major international climate report released today.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, obtained in draft form by USA TODAY, stresses that expanding cities and populations worldwide, also raise the odds of severe impacts from weather disasters.
"Unprecedented extreme weather and climate events" look likely in coming decades as a result of a changing climate, says the draft report. A final version  will be released today by IPCC chief Rajendra Pachauri  at a meeting hosted by report sponsors, the World Meteorological Organization and United Nations Environment Programme, in Kampala, Uganda.
The IPCC and other scientific groups, such as the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, have reconfirmed over the past decade that greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, and deforestation, have led to a 1.4-degree rise in average global-surface-temperatures worldwide in the past century. That rise, the IPCC says, is likely to increase,  with at least 2-in-3 odds that climate extremes have already worsened because of man-made greenhouse gases.
"The time is now for this report," says University of Illinois climate scientist Don Wuebbles, pointing to recent studies linking climate change to extreme weather.  The IPCC report's projection  for the next century:
Worse heat waves worldwide are "very likely."
"Medium confidence" exists that droughts will worsen across southern North America, the Mediterranean and elsewhere.
"High confidence" exists that  economic losses from weather disasters are increasing, with huge year-to-year swings.
The report is noteworthy for pointing to over-development as the driver for increasing dollar losses from extreme weather events, not climate change, says the University of Colorado's Roger Pielke Jr., a past critic of IPCC reports.
"It's dangerous to blame every extreme weather event on climate change," says Weather Underground meteorologist Jeff Masters, adding that it's often hard to make the case for a connection between one and the other. Even so, Masters says, that climate change is increasing  the chances of  floods, droughts and heat waves.
This year, there have been 14 billion-dollar U.S. weather  disasters, according to global reinsurance firm Aon Benfield, shattering the previous record of nine set in 2008.

UN: Changing diet could help save land from climate change

Global warming on land is happening at a rapid rate, and humans will need to change the way they eat and farm to help save the planet, a new United Nations report says.
The report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change describes a cycle in which the problems of land degradation and climate change exacerbate each other to make land and climate less livable.
"The cycle is accelerating," NASA climate scientist Cynthia Rosenzweig, a report co-author, told The Associated Press. "The threat of climate change affecting people's food on their dinner table is increasing."
The review says climate change threatens our food supply "through increasing temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and greater frequency of some extreme events."
The IPCC report, published Thursday and titled "Climate Change and Land," is the latest from scientists around the globe studying climate change and how humans can stop - or contribute to - global temperature increases.
U.N. countries agreed during the Paris climate change conference in 2015 that global temperature increases need to be kept below 2 degrees Centigrade to prevent the most catastrophic effects of climate change. That 2-degree measure is a conservative estimate,  and countries agreed to strive to keep the rise below 1.5 degrees. President Donald Trump announced in 2017 his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement.
"Warming over land has occurred at a faster rate than the global mean, and this has had observable impacts on the land system," the U.N. report authors wrote.
The report focuses on how farming and food production further the problem. The IPCC estimates that 25% to 30% of all greenhouse gas emissions come from food systems.
Changing the food we eat by switching to healthy and sustainable diets full of grains, fruits, vegetables and nuts could reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Meat is identified as "the single food with the greatest impact on the environment" in the report.
Food waste is identified as a major problem: About a third of all food produced is lost or wasted, according to the report.

More willing to pay to fight climate change, survey says; 57% would pay $1 more on electric bill for climate action

How much would you pay on your electric bill to combat climate change?
Is $10 or $20 a month reasonable? $50 too much?
Or, maybe you're unwilling to shell out anything at all.
A new survey offers some insight regarding the extent to which Americans consider climate change a legitimate threat and how much they're willing to pay for government policies that would respond to the phenomena.
Conducted by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC) and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, the inquiry found that 65% of Americans think climate change is a problem that the government needs to address, including 84% of Democrats and 43% of Republicans.
Those findings are consistent with previous polls on the topic. But what's different in this survey is its look at Americans' willingness to reach into their own pockets to help keep temperatures from rising to dangerous levels.
In all, 57% of those polled said they would pay at least $1 more on their monthly electric bill for climate action, including 29% who would pay $20 a month, an amount comparable to federal government estimates of damages from climate change per household.
Twenty percent indicated they would pay $50.
Clearly, resistance to footing a higher electric bill is considerable, too, with 42% of the respondents saying they were unwilling to pay even $1 for such policies. One percent of the participants didn't respond to the question.
Party affiliation is the main determinant of how much cost people would bear, not education, income or geographic location, with Democrats consistently willing to pay more than Republicans, the survey's authors said.
Still, the findings indicate more public support for paying for climate policies such as a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade plan or other regulation than may have been evident before, according to Michael Greenstone, the director of EPIC.
"I think what this says is that quietly there is developing a change in peoples' attitudes with respect to paying for climate policy," Greenstone said in an interview.
"I found it striking that one in five households were willing to pay $50 a month," he added.
Among other survey results:
54% of Americans (67% of Democrats and 46% of Republicans) favor federal regulations that would reduce U.S. coal use, though that support slips to 45% when the question is paired with the assertion that such regulations have resulted in the loss of coal jobs;
Only a quarter of Americans are confident that the U.S. will meet its obligations under an international climate agreement reached in Paris last December, but eight in 10 say the country should still try to meet those responsibilities.
Coming just two months before the November elections, the EPIC-AP survey concludes that energy and climate change are "important issues" for about half of likely voters as they cast their ballots.
Moreover, the results raise questions about the extent of local support for a legal challenge of Obama administration climate policy by 24 states.
Still, in an election year when the personalities of the Democratic and Republican nominees for president attract more attention than specific issues, it's difficult to determine how much public perceptions on an issue like climate change may play a part in determining which candidate wins.
The survey wasn't limited to climate change; it also probed public opinions on the use of hydraulic fracturing to produce gas from shale formations -- one which has led to record gas output in the U.S. in recent years.
Of the six in 10 respondents who had an opinion on fracking, twice as many oppose the practice as support it. Not surprising, the disapproval is much more prevalent among Democrats than Republicans.
"I think fracking is still pretty new," Greenstone said. "Outside of the communities where it's taking place, I think those views are probably still evolving."

Climate-change report urges action; Comprehensive federal study says damage is ongoing

WASHINGTON -- Droughts, floods and wildfires have worsened due to global warming, an Obama administration report found Tuesday in the most complete federal look yet at the effects of a changing climate.
"Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States," released by White House science adviser John Holdren and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration head Jane Lubchenco, echoes past climate assessments but comes amid a push in Congress and by the Obama administration to limit the emission of heat-trapping "greenhouse" gases.
"Human-induced climate change is a reality," said Lubchenco at a White House briefing. "It's not just a problem for the future."
"Climate change is happening now," says Thomas Karl, an NOAA scientist and co-editor of the report. "Changes have already been observed in all aspects of the climate." The report was commissioned during the Bush administration to combine findings from federal agencies with those from other sources. Findings include:
*U.S. temperatures have increased by almost 2 degrees over the past 50 years and are expected to increase by as much as 4 to 11 degrees by 2100.
*Heavy downpours, rising sea levels, rapidly retreating glaciers, thawing permafrost, longer growing seasons and earlier snowmelts are expected to increase.
*Public health effects include increased heat stress, waterborne diseases, poor air quality, extreme weather events, and diseases transmitted by insects and rodents.
"I think the report's findings underline the urgency of dealing with global warming now. The impacts are already being felt and will only get worse," says David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington, D.C.
However, some disagree. "That the federal bureaucracy in Washington has produced yet another alarmist report on global warming is nothing new,"  Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said in an e-mail. "Despite millions of dollars spent on alarmist advertising, the American public remains rightly skeptical of the so-called 'consensus' on global warming."
Says Lubchenco,  "We have greater confidence now than ever before. This report is a game-changer."
*East soaking, but West is dry, 3A

Cities prepare for worst; Local governments act against climate change without federal help

BOSTON - On a sunny summer's day at historic Christopher Columbus Park on Boston's waterfront, it's hard to picture the dormant fury of the Atlantic Ocean as it laps softly at the creaking docks.
57%
of U.S. cities plan
to take climate-related actions
in 2019, according to a
survey of mayors.
But one day, according to the city's climate projections, a massive storm driven by unusually high winds and high tides will pour water over the park's grassy rise and inundate the arbors where grapevines trail and newlyweds pose for photos. The waters will rush across the brick pavers onto Atlantic Avenue and flow toward historic Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market, where generations of tourists have learned about the Boston Tea Party. The floodwaters will threaten nearby Old North Church, where Paul Revere's ride kicked off, and lap at the edges of Bunker Hill.
High tides and strong storms already regularly inundate the area, but this storm would be different. It's a vision that keeps Boston Mayor Marty Walsh up at night.
That's why Walsh is preparing to have the city spend billions of dollars over the next decade to try to blunt the effects  of climate change on the city, including armoring Columbus Park and gently raising it to provide a buffer against the worst the Atlantic can throw.
The plans to harden Columbus Park and large portions of the city's 47 miles of shoreline are part of a massive but generally uncoordinated local-level effort across the country to fight the changes that will accompany the Earth as it continues warming.
Frustrated by what they see as the Trump administration's decision to de-emphasize the danger posed by climate change, local government officials, nonprofit leaders and university researchers are busily forging ahead with limited resources in a piecemeal approach they said is better than nothing. They're hardening buildings, digging bigger storm drains and changing zoning laws to keep homes from being built in low-lying areas prone to flooding.
Though many cities and states are trying to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to slow global warming, these more concrete efforts are aimed at mitigating the actual impacts of climate change, which many elected officials said is politically easier to tackle.
"Climate change is real, and it's impacting our city right now," Walsh said. "We just can't back down from the threat, regardless of what's happening in Washington, D.C. I would love to have a strong federal partner. We don't have that right now. But that doesn't mean we stop."
An exhaustive federal report issued last month warned that climate change could, under a worst-case scenario, deliver a 10 percent hit to the nation's GDP by the end of the century. The 1,600-page National Climate Assessment details the climate and economic impacts U.S. residents will see if drastic action is not taken to address climate change.
President Donald Trump downplayed the report's findings, complaining that the USA is already very "clean" and that other countries aren't addressing climate change.
"I've seen it. I've read some of it. It's fine," Trump said. Speaking about the potential economic effects, Trump said, "I don't believe it."
Broad scientific consensus says the Earth's climate is warming, and humans accelerate that process though the burning of fossil fuels.
Climate change threatens the health and well-being of the American people by causing increasingly extreme weather, changes to air quality, the spread of new diseases by insects and pests and changes to the availability of food and water, the NCA researchers said.
The report says the changing climate poses a cascading series of linked risks, such as storms destroying aging bridges and roads, which would make it harder to move food and fuel around the country, and droughts making it harder for power plants across the West to safely generate electricity because of a lack of required cooling water.
"Earth's climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities," the report concludes.
Experts said the devastating and unusually powerful hurricanes that struck the East Coast over the past decade have done more than any politician could to raise awareness of how much risk the nation faces. Heavy flooding in Texas, warming ocean waters in the Pacific Northwest and New England, and eroding islands in Alaska add even more weight. Scientists have warned for years that ocean levels are rising and that storms will become more violent.
"The number of people having that conversation is larger today than it ever has been in the past," said Mark Misczak,  a longtime emergency manager who spent the bulk of his career as a Federal Emergency Management Agency leader under multiple presidents. "The disasters, as terrible as it sounds, provide an opportunity to re-envision how things function and to consider that resiliency."
Across the country, communities large and small draw on university experts and nonprofit scientists to help chart their course, which they say must be laid down to prepare for climate-related disasters.
Some of the efforts are small, such as Denver's decision to create a list of air-conditioned facilities where residents can take refuge during heat waves. Others are more ambitious: In Alaska, officials are preparing to relocate several native villages in danger of being washed away by seas that no longer freeze solid for months at a time. Many more actions fall into the middle, such as the decision by Florida Keys officials to raise portions of their low-lying roads to serve as flood barriers, or efforts by Austin, Texas, to reduce water consumption in anticipation of droughts.
"It's really simple: This isn't a political issue. The changes we are seeing firsthand are affecting our communities, our economies, affecting ways of life that have existed for millennia," said Michael LeVine of the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy, which worked on climate change issues in Alaska. "We simply don't have a choice. It is incumbent on us as Alaskans to work together. We are past the point of fighting about who did what, who caused what or what the political consequences might be. Our way of life depends on adapting to the changes that are happening."
For many, dealing with climate change is inherently a political issue. A report issued in December by the state of Texas about the need to "future-proof" the state from worsening natural disasters never directly mentions climate change or the role humans have played in emitting heat-trapping carbon dioxide by burning the oil and gas Texas has long been known for.
Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, in releasing the report, said it was "impossible" for him to say whether climate change caused the worsening disasters that hit Texas.
"We need to stop making the old mistakes in local development that expose homes and businesses to risks that only become apparent when disaster strikes," according to the report. "To paraphrase the old saying, an ounce of preparation is worth a pound of cure."
While climate change has largely broken down along partisan lines at the state and federal level, the nation's mayors have overwhelmingly put aside political parties to address the issue. A survey of mayors this year found that 57 percent of cities plan to take climate-related actions in 2019. Dozens of the country's largest cities committed to meeting the terms of the 2025 Paris Agreement on climate change, which Trump is withdrawing from on a national level.
In Boston, Walsh is trying to figure out how to get funding for the city's climate resiliency plan. Taxpayers will contribute 10 percent of all new capital funding in the city toward resilience, but the mayor knows he needs more help from businesses and the state and federal government.
"We're not just planning for the next storm we'll face, we're planning for the storms the next generation will face," Walsh said. "Whatever the federal policy is, it's still going to be incumbent on local leaders to carry out these plans. There's no question that our environment is in trouble, and humans are responsible."

War. Famine. Drought.; More women say they won't have children because of climate change

Though Laura Formisano says she never felt a huge desire to have children, she used to presume that would change.
But climate change could make the planet so uninhabitable, she says, she's not sure she can ever bring herself to become a parent.
"It almost feels like a con, to bring a child into the world when it's probably not going to be a place we're really going to want to live," says Formisano, 30, who manages a co-working space in Los Angeles and has been married for seven months.
Is the future simply too horrific to bring children into? Some couples, frightened by the prospect of droughts, wars, famines and extinctions brought on by climate change, are making that decision.
A Facebook group for women to discuss the idea launched this month, and it's winning  supporters in Europe and the USA. Conceivable Future, a U.S.-based group, has held more than 50 house parties in 16 states in recent years where women worried about global warming discuss forgoing motherhood.
"There are around 70 new signups in the last seven days," says Blythe Pepino, who helped create the Facebook page #BirthStrike.
The reasons women come to that decision are many and varied, but they tend to focus on what they call a clear-eyed view of the changes a warming planet are likely to bring.
For some, the consequences are all too easy to imagine.
Eight years ago, a tornado devastated Christy LeMaster's hometown of Joplin, Missouri. The monster storm was 22 miles long and at times a mile wide. It killed 158 people, injured 1,150 and destroyed almost 7,000 homes. LeMaster's family was OK, but she knows many people who weren't.
"The reality is, they're still rebuilding. Tornadoes on that scale are only supposed to happen every 50 or 60 years. When catastrophes on this scale start happening more often, what does life look like?" says LeMaster, 38, who lives in Chicago and curates public programs at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.
Though LeMaster says she's not someone who has "a deep drive for child-bearing," she'd long thought she would have kids. But as climate change stokes the prospect of serious economic dislocation and fights over resources, "I feel even more scared now," she says.
"If I'm honest with myself, I don't know what water will look like in 10 years, what temperatures will look like in 15, or even food distribution."
Ocasio-Cortez asks the question
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., 29, who pushed for a Green New Deal to  fight climate change, broached the topic last month on Instagram.
"There's scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult, and it does lead, I think, young people to have a legitimate question - is it OK to still have children?" she says in a video streamed from her kitchen.
Newlywed Luci Kade of Atlanta says her friends don't talk about climate change much, which she attributes to the shift "happening on a larger and slower scale than we can comprehend." But the trends are clear to her, and she says she can't ignore them.
"It's really important to respond to the climate change crisis by actually treating it like a crisis. ...  You don't go on with business as usual," says Kade, 28.
The forest fires, hurricanes and other catastrophic weather events in recent years give her pause about what kind of world humanity will live in 30 or 40 years from now.
Because of that, she and her wife decided to adopt. Kade works in the foster care system, so she knows how many children there need families. "It just feels morally and ethically irresponsible to have my own children," she says.
There's growing concern over the dangers climate change poses. People in 13 of 26 countries polled by the Pew Research Center last month said it is the top international threat.
Women more than men are worried. In the USA, 66 percent of women cited global climate change as a major threat to the nation; 51 percent of men did.
Last October, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that mankind has 12 years to act to avoid "rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society." Even in the best scenarios, it said, the world will face more extreme weather  - more wildfires, more droughts, more floods, rising sea levels and the loss of almost all coral reefs.
Whether that affects  family planning isn't known. The U.S. birthrate has been falling for years, and in 2017, it was 60.3 births per 1,000 women - the lowest fertility rate since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began keeping records in 1909. Causes such as women marrying later, worries about the economy and the difficulty of finding affordable child care have all been suggested.
'You're on your own'
No one has polled American women to ask whether climate change is a part of their decision. In Australia, a survey of 6,500 women released last month found 22 percent of respondents in their 30s said they were considering having no more children, or not to have children at all, because of climate change.
"It would break my heart having this child that you love, that you nurture and raise, and then you're leaving them behind with a 'Well, good luck! Things aren't going to get better, you're on your own,'" Formisano says.
Her husband agrees, she says. "He always says, 'We're too many. We don't need to have this many people on Earth.'"
In 2014, Meghan Kallman and Josephine Ferorelli met at a concert in New Hampshire. Both 30 at the time, they began talking about climate change and "within five minutes" came to the topic of not having children because of their worries about how bad things seemed likely to get, they say.
They had never found a place to share their fear. After talking most of the night, they decided they couldn't be the only ones wrestling with such concerns. They launched house parties where people could talk about  family planning and climate change.
Kallman, a professor of international development at the University of Massachusetts-Boston, and Ferorelli, a climate activist in Chicago, acknowledge that whatever happens, as two white women in the USA, they won't find things as difficult as women elsewhere in the world. Even so, they're consumed by "the knowledge that what we're facing is so much worse than we imagine," Kallman says.
Difficult decisions
Ryanne Hoogeboom, 38, attended one of the early events. She lives in Albuquerque with her 4-year-old daughter, Kit. Though she loves her daughter dearly, she and her partner decided not to have any more children. "He's in the same camp I am," she says.
When Hoogeboom explains to relatives why Kit doesn't have any siblings, she gets confused looks if she mentions climate change.
"People don't really understand what I'm so freaked out about. 'It's going to get figured out' is their attitude," she says.
To be sure, the decision to not have children isn't a full-on movement; it's more a discussion beginning to bubble up in people's consciousness. Organizers are clear that it's not about population control.
"It's not like my choosing to have a kid or not is going to solve the climate crisis," Kallman says.
The goal isn't to get women and men to pledge not to have children but instead to provide a place to talk about a topic that most people don't want to discuss.
"It's not anybody's answer to this question that matters, it's the fact that people are even having to ask this question," Ferorelli says. "That's what's messed up."

Fonda finds hope fighting climate change

Jane Fonda's 82nd birthday party was a doozy. The Oscar-winning actress spent the special day in December with some of her celebrity friends: Rosanna Arquette, Gloria Steinem and Casey Wilson  were all there. Hundreds of other new friends showed up, too, waving signs and chanting, "We love you!" Fonda smiled and waved, wearing a fetching fire-engine-red coat.  Then, the best part: She got arrested.
In her new book, "What Can I Do? My Path from Climate Despair to Action," out today,  Fonda calls her day in police detention the "best birthday party ever."
It was all part of the plan for that very special Fire Drill Friday. Fonda had launched the initiative in October with Greenpeace and other environmental activism allies to protest every Friday in the streets of the nation's capital.
Those protests would culminate in acts of nonviolent civil disobedience.
Many people, including celebrities, were arrested, to draw attention to the climate crisis.
Her birthday Fire Drill Friday arrest was Fonda's fifth. On another occasion, she used her detainment to get in a quick workout.
"I did wall squats for a while, meditated, and eventually was able to sleep using a sweater as a pillow and my red coat both to soften the metal under me and as a cover," Fonda writes.
Fonda is using the full force of her considerable celebrity to help execute a relentless public pressure campaign to raise awareness - and ultimately, she hopes, pressure Congress into passing the Green New Deal, a sweeping climate change proposal that seeks to transition the U.S. away from fossil fuels and limit greenhouse gas emissions.
"I was slipping into despair before I went to D.C. I spent a year depressed about climate change and feeling I wasn't doing enough," Fonda tells USA TODAY. "Once I went to D.C. and began that action, my despondency disappeared."
She's hoping her book can help pull others out of their climate despair and start putting in the work to save the planet. "What Can I Do?" isn't a rhetorical question - Fonda details her journey as a climate change activist and charts a course for readers out of climate despair.
Here's what else Fonda has to say about the climate crisis, the importance of organized activism, the coronavirus pandemic and the 2020 presidential election.
A committed activist for most of her adult life, Fonda has long stood up to forces bigger than herself and held her ground (including, but not limited to, the United States government). She's opposed the Vietnam War and the Iraq War, supported the civil rights and feminist movements and fought for Native American land rights.
Still, the generally unflappable Fonda despaired when confronted with the gravity of the climate crisis.
"I would wonder if perhaps humankind deserved the fate it had created," Fonda writes. "Just get rid of us Homo sapiens ASAP and things will restore themselves."
A mother and grandmother, Fonda knew that wasn't an option.
"I knew this fatalist thinking was a cop-out, and I didn't like myself for it," she writes. What helped convince Fonda to fight for change was actually listening to what climate scientists were saying.
"The scientists are very clear: We have to cut our fossil fuel emissions in half by 2030," Fonda says. "They say we have the technology to do it, we have the money to do it, we have everything we need to do it except enough people to force the government to actually do it."
Hence Fire Drill Fridays. Fonda doesn't have the power to single-handedly lower global temperatures, but she does have the power of celebrity. With it, she can draw attention to the cause and help to build a nonviolent army that may someday be big enough and loud enough to compel the government to take action.
She's drawing other celebrities to the cause, too, including some rather unlikely ones. Sam Waterston, her co-star on the popular Netflix series "Grace and Frankie" and a self-described moderate, is nearly 80 and wasn't exactly a rabble-rouser - at least not until he joined Fonda at a Fire Drill Friday protest. Two weeks later, he was sending Fonda pictures of himself in handcuffs again - this time on the playing field at a Harvard-Yale game in support of students demanding their universities divest from fossil fuels.
Fonda says, "He was holding up his handcuffed hands saying, 'Look what you started!'"
As with so many other things - school, work, major political conventions - the coronavirus pandemic has forced Fire Drill Fridays to go virtual. Each week, Fonda hosts Fireside Friday Drills, conducting video chats with prominent political, social and activist figures. There are also teach-ins with scientists, professors and other experts, and virtual rallies to help keep up the energy of the virtual volunteer army. Fonda says a recent Friday saw 600,000 people following across all platforms.
But while the pandemic didn't kill the movement, Fonda sees it as a harbinger  - and argues that climate change is partially responsible.
"Pandemics are becoming more and more frequent, and that itself is connected to the climate crisis," Fonda says. As climate change warms weather and shortens winters, Fonda says, disease-carrying animals and insects begin to move into new areas. Cutting down forests releases bats and other animals into populated areas, possibly carrying diseases that humans aren't immune to. Melting permafrost in the Arctic could release  pathogens.
"What we learned from (COVID-19) is the importance of having a robust federal government, that it be prepared, and that it listen to the experts, the scientists," Fonda says. "I think people really realize with COVID how non-resilient the United States is in the face of increasingly extreme weather events. We are not ready."
Fonda is critical of President Donald Trump's administration and its record on climate change. When asked whether she sees the coming election as a do-or-die moment for climate reform, Fonda doesn't hesitate. "Yes," she says emphatically.
"Maybe a whole lot of people, especially young people, were big supporters of Bernie Sanders, and they're disappointed that he and his policies didn't win," Fonda says. "My message is: I'd rather push a moderate than fight a fascist."
That "moderate" is Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, whose climate policies are less progressive than Sanders'. Fonda understands the disappointment young progressives in particular might feel, but still, she says they need to get out the vote for Biden this November.
"We're not asking them to send him a valentine, we're not asking them to fall in love with him or date him," Fonda says. "Come on, get over yourself, and get ready to fight the fight of your life."

Deal on climate change is elusive; Political, economic issues hinder talks to stop warming

Two years ago, more than 180 nations made a bold promise: By the end of 2009, they would draft a sweeping treaty to slow climate change.
Yvo de Boer, the United Nations' top climate-change official, called the agreement "a real breakthrough," and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown expressed confidence it would produce "a deal ... in 2009 to address the defining challenge of our time."
Now the deadline is nearing, and hope is fading. The treaty is supposed to be finalized at talks that start Dec. 7 in Copenhagen, but diplomats have made almost no progress toward an agreement -- a point made repeatedly by world leaders Tuesday at the U.N. climate summit in New York City.
"As we head towards Copenhagen, there should be no illusions that the hardest part of our journey is in front of us," President Obama said at the U.N.
Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt warned of a deadlock. "The negotiations are going far too slowly," he said.
The debate over climate change is wrapped in a range of political and economic conflicts.
Climate scientists, such as Rajendra Pachauri, head of a U.N.-organized group of thousands of climate experts, say the world is headed for dramatic changes unless nations slash emissions of carbon dioxide -- from cars, power plants and factories -- and other greenhouse gases soon.
The key question is how to do so without crippling the worldwide economy -- and making such limits fair to industrialized nations such as the United States as well as developing nations and rising powers such as China. The U.S. Energy Department says China is the only nation that produces more carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels than the USA.
The notion that such emissions are dramatically changing the climate is widely accepted.
The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a report two years ago saying the odds are better than 90% that global warming is caused by humans. Even so, there are holdouts -- notably Republicans in the U.S. Senate, which ratifies treaties involving the USA -- who question whether emissions have much of a role in what they suggest is a natural warming of the planet.
Meanwhile, there are questions about whether even a dramatic reduction in emissions would avoid dangerous climate changes.
Against that backdrop, the scramble for a deal to combat global warming continues.
Key nations will take part in climate talks at a flurry of upcoming meetings, including the G-20 meeting in Pittsburgh of major economic powers Thursday and Friday and further U.N. talks starting Monday in Bangkok.
The Earth isn't waiting, scientists say.
If emissions keep increasing as they have, the planet's average temperature will rise 3 to 7 degrees by 2100, according to the U.N. climate panel's 2007 report.
A temperature rise of more than 3 1/2 degrees could melt the ice covering Greenland -- raising sea levels 20 feet, says climate scientist Jonathan Gregory of Britain's University of Reading.
If Antarctica's ice melts, too, cities such as Hong Kong and Miami would be threatened, MIT climate scientist John Reilly says.
Scientists at the Hadley Centre reported this year that above 3 1/2 degrees, swaths of the Amazon rainforest will die.
Despite such dire scenarios, drafting a climate treaty will be "10 times more difficult" than it was in 1997, when diplomats meeting in Kyoto, Japan, agreed to the world's first mandatory climate pact, says John Prescott, Britain's former deputy prime minister and an important player in the Kyoto deal. More nations are involved now, Prescott says, and they are further apart on how much to cut emissions.
The worldwide financial crisis is adding to the economic concerns that surround talks on a climate-change treaty.
Obama acknowledged the economic pressures in Tuesday's speech, saying "every nation's most immediate priority is reviving their economy and putting their people back to work. And so all of us will face doubts and difficulties in our own capitals as we try to reach a lasting solution to the climate challenge."
The Bush administration and the Senate opposed the Kyoto Protocol because it exempted developing nations such as China and India from mandatory emissions cuts, which U.S. politicians feared would put the USA at an economic disadvantage. The Senate's lack of approval of the Kyoto treaty helped make the treaty ineffective in cutting emissions.
Today, many U.S. senators have the same worries they had in the 1990s: that a climate treaty would slow economic growth, make U.S. industry less competitive and drive up energy prices.
The Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012. If the deal making in Copenhagen leads to a new pact that would harm the U.S. economy, "no such treaty or agreement can be approved by the Senate," says Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla.
Here are some of the problems confronting the global effort to cool the Earth's temperature:
Mistrust and finger-pointing
In Copenhagen, countries are supposed to settle which of them would be required to lower their emissions and by how much.
The battle over those issues is unlikely to end this year, says Eileen Claussen, head of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change and a former U.S. climate official. That's because the countries are far apart:
*The European Union suggested to the U.N. that industrialized countries, including its members, cut emissions by 30% by 2020. Meeting that limit plus another goal to use more solar power and other "renewable energy" would cost tens of billions of dollars in 2020, according to a European Commission study.
*China, which considers itself a developing country, wants developed countries to cut emissions 40% by 2020, according to the official Xinhua news agency. China insists it should not be subject to mandatory emissions cuts, pointing to its efforts to produce more renewable energy and to become more energy-efficient.
*A bill passed by the House of Representatives in June would use a carbon-trading system to help cut U.S. emissions 17% by 2020, according to an analysis by the World Resources Institute, an environmental research group. A similar bill is scheduled to be introduced in the Senate in the next few weeks.
The numbers being floated are partly bargaining positions, says former U.S. climate negotiator Rafe Pomerance, now president of Clean Air-Cool Planet, a non-profit climate-change group. But he said nations "end up creating a set of expectations that would be difficult to meet."
Demands for money
Several dozen industrialized nations agreed two years ago to dig deeper into their pockets for climate-related aid.
Developing countries would draw on the funds to cut their own emissions and to cope with the effects of a warming world, such as water-collection projects to guard against drought.
The thorny question is how much money wealthier nations will offer. At negotiations in August, developing countries requested $400 billion a year. A U.N. report released Sept. 1 pegged the need at more than $500 billion a year.
That far outstrips the money that developed nations are likely to put on the table, particularly at a time of budget deficits.
The European Union said Sept. 10 that it would contribute up to $22 billion a year, but the United States has kept quiet. Obama's proposed budget for foreign aid in 2010 is $36.5 billion for public health programs, anti-drug campaigns and other projects.
Developing nations have threatened to derail the talks if their demands aren't met.
If a treaty "is not consistent with our minimal position," Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said Sept. 3, according to Reuters, "we are prepared to walk out of any negotiations."
Senate stalemate
Twelve years ago, the Senate overwhelmingly opposed a global-warming treaty -- 95 of the 100 senators voted for a resolution against any agreement that would harm the U.S. economy.
U.S. diplomats learned their lesson, Claussen says: Don't settle on a treaty that's likely to be rejected back home.
This time, U.S. climate negotiators have "made clear" that they won't finalize a treaty without "a very good sense of where Congress is," Claussen says.
The clock is working against the U.S. team. Introduction of a Senate version of the climate bill has been delayed repeatedly and may not take place until October, in part because of the health care debate. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said last week that a bill may not come up for a vote until 2010.
The House version includes measures to soften economic impacts of reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Among them are financial aid to workers who lose their jobs because of the bill and barriers to importing goods from nations that don't cut emissions.
Even so, most Republican senators oppose a bill on climate change, and many moderate Democrats -- especially those from coal and manufacturing states in the Midwest -- are worried that such a plan would mean job losses in their states.
There's also a faction of senators who are skeptical that climate change is a problem at all.
"A lot of members of Congress ... are absolutely convinced" that humans are the primary cause of global warming, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said last month. "I haven't reached that conclusion at this point."
Scientific realities
Nearly all the news from scientists add up to one hard truth: It will be extremely difficult to avoid more warming of the Earth.
Even if carbon dioxide emissions fell to zero tomorrow, the Earth's temperature would continue to rise, says climate researcher Francisco de la Chesnaye of the Electric Power Research Institute.
That's because it takes decades for the climate to adjust fully to a new level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, he says.
In July, the European Union and 16 of the world's wealthiest nations -- including China and the United States -- signed a statement acknowledging the scientific opinion that the Earth's temperature rise "ought not to exceed" roughly 3 1/2 degrees.
That's a tall order. The Earth already has warmed 1 1/2 degrees since the late 19th century and will warm another 1 degree by 2100 based on the greenhouse gases already emitted.
To keep the temperature rise below 3 1/2 degrees, greenhouse gases may have to be cleansed from the atmosphere, says Hugh Pitcher of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
That might be accomplished, say Pitcher and other climate experts, with technology that doesn't yet exist: systems to suck carbon dioxide from the air and store it underground.
"We have got ourselves painted into a little bit of a corner on this one," he says.
Based on the amount of greenhouse gases now in the atmosphere, achieving the 3 1/2 degree goal "will require huge efforts over the whole century," MIT climate expert Henry Jacoby says. "The kind of agreement that can be reached in Copenhagen can only get started on that task."
Though it will be difficult to prevent more warming, that doesn't mean "we might as well go home and forget it," Jacoby says. "If we get discouraged and don't do anything, the implications are very, very serious. The risks are very, very great."

Climate change 'real risk,' nominee says; Trump UN pick breaks with the White House

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump's nominee to be United Nations ambassador publicly broke with the White House over climate change on Wednesday, calling it a "real risk" and promising to take the issue seriously if confirmed to the high-profile diplomatic position.
The statement by Kelly Knight Craft - made during a contentious Senate confirmation hearing - marked a sharp reversal from her previous comments, in which she said she believed "both sides" of the science on climate change.
"Climate change needs to be addressed as it poses real risk to our planet," Craft, the U.S. ambassador to Canada, said in opening remarks before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
"Let there be no doubt" that human behavior is contributing to global warming, she added. "I will be an advocate in addressing climate change," Craft promised, although she also said the United States should not shoulder an "outsized burden" in curbing greenhouse gas emissions.
Craft's statement was particularly remarkable because of her family ties to the coal industry and because Trump has questioned whether climate change is man-made.
Craft is a top Republican donor from Kentucky, and her billionaire husband, Joseph Craft III, is the president and CEO of Alliance Resource Partners, a major U.S. coal company. Trump tapped Craft for the U.N. post at the urging of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.
Craft and her husband donated $1million to Trump's inauguration in 2016, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics. The center's data show that Alliance Resource Partners, through its employees and other associated entities, have donated more than $5 million to federal candidates since 2010 - almost exclusively to Republicans, including several GOP members of the Foreign Relations Committee.
Campaign donors are often rewarded with plum ambassador posts. Craft's supporters say she is well qualified for the job, pointing in part to her tenure in Canada, where she helped navigate the contentious trade negotiations that led to a new agreement to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.
McConnell introduced Craft at Wednesday's hearing, calling her a distinguished stateswoman and leader who has "the knowledge, talent and experience" to represent the U.S. at the United Nations.
It's not clear if Craft's reversal on climate change will be enough to assuage Senate Democrats, who sharply questioned her commitment to confronting an issue that tops the United Nations' agenda.
Craft sparked ridicule and outrage when she claimed to believe scientists on "both sides" of the climate change debate in a 2017 interview with Canada's CBC television network.
"I believe there are scientists on both sides that are accurate," Craft said when asked if she believed in climate change.
Pressed on whether she believes humans are not contributing to climate change, she said then: "Well, I think that both sides have, you know, their own results from their studies, and I appreciate and respect both sides of the science."
Wednesday's hearing comes more than six months after Trump's first U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, left the administration. Trump initially tapped Heather Nauert, a former Fox News host and State Department spokeswoman, to replace Haley. But Nauert withdrew amid questions about her qualifications for the high-profile position.

Climate change threatens half of U.S. military sites worldwide
USA TODAY
February 1, 2018 Thursday, FINAL EDITION

Military leaders are sounding another alarm about  climate change, saying in a new report that half of U.S. military sites already have been affected by floods, wildfires, droughts and other weather extremes that are exacerbated by rising global temperatures.
After a request from Congress, the Defense Department studied climate risks to all 3,500 U.S. military sites around the world. It found that nearly 800 had been affected by droughts, 350 by extreme temperatures, 225 by storm surge-related flooding and more than 200 by wildfires, among other  events.
Climate scientists say those types of extreme weather events have  become more common as global temperatures increase. Sea levels are rising, storms are getting more intense, dry regions are getting drier and fire seasons are getting longer, research shows.
The Defense Department's report released last week says that the military "looks at climate through the lens of its mission," and that "changes in climate affect national security in several ways."
"Our warfighters require bases from which to deploy, on which to train, or to live when they are not deployed. If extreme weather makes our critical facilities unusable or necessitate costly or manpower-intensive work-arounds, that is an unacceptable impact," says the report, which was prepared by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.
That message is at odds with the Trump administration's rejection of climate change as a serious problem. Federal agencies are rolling back regulations that limit the emission of planet-warming gases  such as carbon dioxide, and President Trump announced plans last year to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, an international accord to fight climate change.
The administration didn't discuss climate  in its National Security Strategy, released in December, nor in its National Defense Strategy, released in January -- the first time in a decade that the document ignored climate change.
But military leaders -- including Trump's Defense secretary, James Mattis -- continue to describe climate change as a security threat, which has  the ability not only to hamper military operations but also to stir up instability in already-unstable parts of the world.
Mattis told Congress during his confirmation hearing that global warming is "impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating today." Researchers, for instance, have found that a severe drought helped kindle the Syrian civil war.
The Defense Department's new report lists several examples of extreme weather damaging military sites, including flooding from Hurricane Sandy at West Point Military Reservation in New York and Naval Weapons Station Earle in New Jersey.
The report also describes erosion of a rock seawall that protects an airstrip at Cape Lisburne Long Range Radar Station in northwest Alaska, which required  a $47 million replacement project.
The report has some shortcomings, said David Titley, a retired Navy rear admiral and former top official at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who now leads the Center for Solutions to Weather and Climate Risk at Penn State University.
For one thing, Titley said, the report doesn't examine trends over time. Military officials were asked survey questions about  the effects of weather on their bases over the  past 30 years, meaning it's unclear how much of an effect climate change has had.
"I am not surprised weather impacts have a big impact on (military) operations. I've known that ever since I've been in the Navy," Titley said.
Still, Titley said, the report is a strong baseline for future studies. "This really gets to the crux of the matter, which is readiness," he  said.  "If our bases are under increasing threat from extreme weather, then that will impair readiness."

Is Earth near its 'tipping points'?; Scientists: There may be no return from climate change
USA TODAY
April 4, 2007 Wednesday, FINAL EDITION

Earth is spinning toward many points of no return from the damage of global warming, after which disease, desolation and famine are inevitable, say scientists involved in an international report due  Friday on the effects of climate change.
Opinions vary about how long it will take to reach those "tipping points" and whether attempts to cut planet-warming gases churned out by power plants, vehicles and other human industry can slow, halt or reverse the harmful effects in coming decades. Some suggest  it might be cheaper for society to adapt to the changing climate than to roll back the pace of warming.
But in the report, the second of three this year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, thousands of climate scientists and representatives of more than 100 nations, including the USA, present in the most stark terms the "key global risks" -- serious environmental consequences from the changing climate -- that threaten humanity.
"It's time (a report) puts people on the planet into the picture" of global warming, says economist Gary Yohe of Wesleyan University, a lead author of the report.
Concerning the USA, the report will reference numerous scientific studies on the effects of spring arriving weeks earlier, says University of Montana ecologist Steve Running, an author of the chapter on North America. The "big climate signal and impacts"  will be in the West, he says. Earlier melting of mountain snow, on which much of the region depends for water, would mean more severe dry spells and droughts that would trigger worse wildfire seasons. Lower stream flows also would threaten fish and wildlife.
Research also has predicted more frequent heat waves, increased rainfall and flooding in northern states, and more severe tropical storms on the Gulf and East coasts.
In its first report in February, the panel, backed by the World Meteorological Organization and conducted under the auspices of the United Nations Environmental Programme, concluded that "unequivocal" evidence shows industrial releases of greenhouse gases have warmed the Earth an average of about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the past century. That makes it "very likely" that temperatures will rise 3 to 7 degrees this century, depending on future emissions.
This week's report, essentially a review and condensation of climate research since 2001, is designed to identify the dangers that the failure to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present for the planet. Just as new buildings in earthquake zones are designed to handle more than everyday shocks, and fire insurance is meant to cover more than burnt toast, politicians and planners want to know worst-case scenarios, says Stanford University climatologist Stephen Schneider.
"In a sense, we are looking at a series of tipping points for humanity and climate," says Richard Moss, director of the U.S. Global Change Research Program Office.
Irreversible effects on plants, animals, farming and weather already are apparent, says biologist Camille Parmesan of the University of Texas in Austin, one of the scientists assigned to review the report.  Studies weighed in the report show that warming has eliminated about 70 animal species and affects 59% of wild species surveyed.
"We are seeing plenty of potentially dangerous outcomes where the hotter it gets, the worse it gets," Stanford's Schneider says.
Moss says the roughly 5-degree rise in global average temperatures envisioned in the February report will cause damage that cannot be recovered. He echoes a warning by NASA scientist James Hansen in 2004 that the window for action is only 10 years. The Stern Review, a high-profile report last year by the United Kingdom's chief economist, Nicholas Stern, warns of serious financial threats to agriculture and commerce.
Some scientists question such concerns. Danish statistician Bjorn Lomborg has become a spokesman for the view that trying to repair global warming will cost more money than just working to adapt the world to it. He suggests, for instance, that it would be cheaper to cure and eradicate malaria than to attack the rising temperatures that could expose millions more people to the disease.
Gore makes his case
Last month, Lomborg followed former vice president Al Gore to the microphone in testifying before a House committee. Gore, star of the Oscar-winning documentary on warming, An Inconvenient Truth, called the phenomenon a "planetary emergency." Lomborg countered that Gore "has gotten carried away and has come to show only worst-case scenarios."
Schneider argues that worst-case scenarios are still  real threats. A collapse of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which Lomborg downplayed at the hearing, genuinely worries scientists such as Stefan Rahmstorf of Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. Rahmstorf has suggested sea levels could rise as much as 4.6 feet worldwide by 2100. Schneider says a simple cost-benefit analysis ignores the reality that poor people in Bangladesh and other low-lying lands would have to bear the brunt of climate change.
In Brussels this week, about 60 lead authors are working with representatives of more than 100 nations to distill, clarify and approve the panel's findings in a short summary for policymakers. The summary is out Friday; the scientific chapters arrive Tuesday.
Environmental and energy analyst Anthony Patt of Boston University, a report co-author,  says the report will divide the possible effects of temperature increases this century into three grades: a 3.6-degree rise with warmer winters but few human catastrophes; an up to 7.2-degree rise that wealthy nations could handle but would prove calamitous to poor nations and many species; and an even higher rise, which "would prove difficult for any society to adapt to."
What are the yardsticks?
In grades of scientific certainty, physical effects such as temperature, sea level rise and concentrations of greenhouse gases are most certain, Schneider says. Next come biological ones, such as species extinctions. And the hardest to estimate are human effects, such as disease and hunger.
What the panel's report will not establish is whether vast infestations by pine beetles in the forests of the western USA and Canada are tied to warming, Running says. Although many scientists believe there is a link, he says, research has not focused enough on temperature. "My nose is telling me there's a climate-change signal here, but the papers in print yet aren't doing a strong enough analysis."
Worldwide, thresholds were outlined last year in "Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change," a summary of tipping points for which British Prime Minister Tony Blair  wrote the foreword. They include:
*At a 3.6-degree rise, all Indian Ocean coral reefs go extinct, and 97% of the rest around the globe are "bleached" or severely damaged. All Arctic ice disappears.
*At a 5.4-degree increase,  half of all nature reserves become unable to conserve native species. The Amazon rainforest disappears.
*At 7.2 degrees or higher, coastal flooding is seven times worse than in 1990. Malaria threatens 330million more people a year, and hunger jeopardizes 600 million. Australia no longer can grow food.
All of this leaves aside the most extreme risks that Schneider calls the "dark edge of the bell curve": melting of the vast Antarctic ice sheets; shutdown of Atlantic Ocean circulation, which brings warm weather to the United Kingdom; and the release of more greenhouse gases frozen in the Arctic tundra.
Some scientists, such as Penn State's Michael Mann, worry that the panel's reports lag behind the latest science because of a six-month research cutoff before their release, a lifetime in climate study.
Last month, for instance, a report in Geophysical Research Letters found that ocean acidification from increased carbon dioxide is likely to wreak "havoc" for shellfish and coral and disrupt food chains.
A Colorado State University analysis in March said warming will make grazing lands less productive by 2050.
A University of Minnesota team reported that Lake Superior has warmed an average of 4.5 degrees since 1979, about twice the local atmospheric warming.
Because the panel's reports trail such research, they are "always by design ... a little conservative," Mann says.
In May, the climate panel picks up where this month's report leaves off: an assessment of ways to counteract and adapt to warming.
"I suspect we're reluctant to think about it because we're worried that if we start, we will have no choice but to think about nothing else," John Lanchester, who reviewed recent works on climate change, wrote in a recent London Review of Books.
"The scientists involved are not just talking in a new way, one unfamiliar to both them and us, but are in effect trying to sell us something," Lanchester says. "And we the public might be undereducated, but we know not to trust entirely someone who is trying to sell us something. ... We deeply don't want to believe this story."
But James McCarthy of Harvard, incoming head of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, says the reality of warming is accepted, with regional climate-change trends already playing out as predicted.
The biggest tipping point already may have happened, says John Drexhage of Canada's International Institute for Sustainable Development: Talk of global warming has become routine and accepted for all politicians, not just Al Gore. 

The warming world
Significant effects of climate change expected worldwide in the 21st century:
North America
Reduced springtime snow pack; changing river flows; rising sea level; increased intensity and energy of Atlantic hurricanes; more frequent, intense heat waves and wildfires.
Pacific and small islands
Inundation of low-lying coral islands as sea level rises; widespread coral bleaching, ending their use as fish nurseries; more powerful typhoons.
Central America
and West Indies
Greater likelihood of intense rainfall and more powerful hurricanes; biodiversity loss as specialized local species succumb to abrupt climate shifts.
South America
Melting glaciers reduce water supplies; more frequent occurrence of intense periods of rain, leading to more flash floods.
Global oceans
Made more acidic by increasing CO{-2} concentration; water circulation slows.
Arctic
Significant retreat of ice; disrupted habitats of polar mega-fauna; accelerated loss of ice from Greenland Ice Sheet and mountain glaciers; shifting of ocean fishing regions; replacement of most tundra by forest.
Africa
Declining agricultural yields and diminished food security; increased occurrence of drought and stresses on water supplies.
Europe
More intense winter precipitation, river flooding and other hazards; increased summer heat waves and melting of mountain glaciers; greater water stress in southern regions.
Central and northern Asia
Widespread melting of permafrost, disrupting transportation and buildings; greater swampiness and ecosystem stress from warming; coastal erosion as a result of sea ice retreat.
Southern Asia
More intense cyclones increase flooding of deltas and coastal plains; major loss of mangroves and coral reefs; increased pressure on water resources with rising population and need for irrigation.
Australia and New Zealand
Substantial loss of coral along Great Barrier Reef; significant diminishment of water resources; coastal inundation of some settled areas; increased fire risk; some early benefits to agriculture.
Antarctica and Southern Ocean
Increasing risk of significant ice loss from West Antarctic Ice Sheet, risking much higher sea level in centuries ahead; accelerating loss of sea ice, disrupting marine life and penguins.

Climate change is already damaging children's health worldwide and could shape the well-being of an entire generation - unless the world meets the Paris Agreement targets to limit warming to well below 3.6 degrees F, according to a new report published Wednesday by the British health journal The Lancet.
According to the report, if the world continues its  path - with high carbon dioxide emissions and climate change continuing at the current rate - a child born today will face a world on average over 7 degrees F warmer by their 71st birthday, threatening their health at every stage of their lives.
"Children are particularly vulnerable to the health risks of a changing climate. Their bodies and immune systems are still developing, leaving them more susceptible to disease and environmental pollutants," said Dr. Nick Watts, a report co-author and executive director of the Lancet Countdown.
"The damage done in early childhood is persistent and pervasive, with health consequences lasting for a lifetime," Watts said. "Without immediate action from all countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions, gains in well-being and life expectancy will be compromised, and climate change will come to define the health of an entire generation."
The report, titled The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change, is a collaboration among 120 climate and health experts from 35 institutions around the globe.
The report stated that as temperatures rise, harvests will shrink - threatening food security and driving up food prices. Infants and small children are among the worst affected by malnutrition and related health problems such as stunted growth, weak immune systems and long-term developmental issues.

Climate change may endanger your dog; Insect pests and diseases they carry spread into new parts of USA

SAN FRANCISCO - As if storms, floods and heat waves weren't enough, some experts fear climate change is expanding the distribution of diseases that can sicken or even kill dogs, putting more pets at risk for diseases their owners have never had to deal with before.
Troubling trends
Some types of ticks live in areas of the USA where they were previously unheard of.
Though the peak of the summer season is becoming too hot for ticks, they're able to survive longer during the rest of the year.
Heartworm larvae - the contagious stage - are able to mature faster. In 82-degree weather, they mature in 11 to 12 days as opposed to 16 to 20 days in 71-degree weather.
Though diseases in dogs are not tracked as intensively as those in humans, veterinary epidemiologists and biologists said Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a bacterial disease that can cause fever, joint pain and vomiting, is moving into California and Texas. Heartworm disease, which can damage the cardiovascular system and clog the heart, is spreading beyond its traditional home in the South and Southeast. Lyme disease, which can cause joint swelling and lameness, affects dogs as far north as Canada.
"The veterinarians need to know what's local. But what's out there is changing so fast, how are you going to keep up?" said Janet Foley, a professor of epidemiology at the School of Veterinary Medicine of the University of California, Davis.
Many of these diseases also affect humans. But dogs are especially at risk because they spend a lot of time outdoors and in vegetation.
Warren Hess, assistant director of the American Veterinary Medical Association, said the spread of heartworm disease is increasing because of the changes in how frequently dogs are moved across the country.
"With the increased social pressure to restrict the sale of dogs in pet stores, this has resulted in a dramatic increase in the movement of dogs from pet shelters to fill the demand," he said.
Natural disasters also play a part. "The biggest spread in heartworm disease in the United States certainly followed the 2005 national distribution of dogs due to Hurricane Katrina," said Hess, whose responsibilities include disaster preparedness.
He said that although climate change is happening, and will continue to happen, "it is important that we properly frame the discussions and use all available science as we further the discussion."
Linking the expansion or shift of ticks that carry diseases, infection rates and dog populations is not an easy task. There are no mandated reporting requirements as there are for some human diseases. Data on tick and mosquito distribution is piecemeal in many areas. Tests for some of the diseases  didn't exist 10 years ago, so it's difficult to judge their historic range.
Even so, many scientists see patterns and links that point them toward climate change.
More ticks
"There's no smoking gun, and there will never be a smoking gun. We're trying to connect two things that operate at very different scales both in time and space," said Ram Raghavan, a professor of spatial epidemiology at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kansas.
He documented significant changes to the tick populations in the Midwest - in infestation intensity, the areas and when ticks are active. His team's surveillance in western parts of Kansas and Oklahoma found Lone Star ticks that didn't use to live there. These ticks can carry ehrlichiosis, a disease that in dogs can cause bruising of the gums, bleeding from the nose and lameness.
"There is this belief that these ticks do not exist in these areas, but increasingly over the last five years, we're constantly finding them. So I'm pretty sure they've expanded" their habitat, he said. "Tick-borne diseases have really gone up. We go out into the field, and we see and find ticks more easily than we used to do in the past."
To get to the bottom of it will require data that doesn't exist. Raghavan has written several grant proposals to the U.S. National Institutes of Health for funding to do long-term studies, broad testing and analysis.
"Regardless of who caused climate change, climate has changed. Let's take the emotion out of the debate and get some answers," he said.
Temperatures in the contiguous USA are on average 1.5 degrees warmer than they were the century before, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Rainfall and humidity levels have changed in some areas. All of these factors affect where insects that can carry disease thrive.
Veterinarians and biologists who study diseases spread by insects observed that it's not just where but when the diseases strike that's changing.
"Diseases like Lyme disease that used to be transmitted in the peak summer months could now be peaking in the spring and fall because it's too hot in the summer. So you get a longer transmission window," said Andrew Dobson, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton University in New Jersey.
Rocky Mountain spotted fever
Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a disease carried by ticks,  can sicken and even kill humans and their canine companions. The bacteria initially invades the bloodstream, then settles into the cells that line blood vessels. Blood can seep out of the vessels and pool under the skin or even in the brain. The disease can be treated with antibiotics if caught in time.
At UC Davis, Foley studies its spread. Historically, most cases were spread by the American dog tick and occurred in the southern Atlantic states and the south-central states. North Carolina and Oklahoma accounted for the largest proportion.
Foley has tracked a new tick strain making its way north. This tropical strain of the brown dog tick has been found in many parts of the world and is known in the USA in Florida, Texas, Arizona and Southern California, where it may have been introduced from Brazil and Mexico. It can carry Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Cases are appearing along the U.S.-Mexican border in areas that have never had to deal with the disease before. The new tick has gotten as far north as Los Angeles. Foley expects it to make its way up through California's Central Valley as far north as Sacramento.
It's much more aggressive than tick species Americans are used to.
"It bites more, the hotter it gets. So the hotter it is, the more infections there are," Foley said.
Heartworm cases
The parasitic worms called Dirofilaria immitis are spread through the bite of a mosquito that carries them in a larval state. They cause an especially grisly disease. Once a dog is infected with the heartworm larva, it can grow into a foot-long parasitic worm that invades the dog's cardiovascular system, damages the arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs and blocks blood flow to the lungs by their presence and the clots they can cause.
To spread from one dog to another, the larvae have to develop to a specific infective stage inside the mosquito. The hotter it gets, the more quickly the larvae mature into a form that can transfer from the mosquitoes to the dogs. When it's 71 degrees out, that process can take 16 to 20 days. If it's 82 degrees, it takes 11 to 12 days, said Bruce Kornreich, a cardiologist and professor of veterinary medicine at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine in New York.
Heartworm disease has historically been a problem in the South and Southeast. Environments farther north are now able to support the mosquitoes that transmit it and the larvae that cause it.
Infections are rising. From 2013 to 2016, there was a 21.7% increase in heartworm infections in the number of dogs per veterinary clinic testing positive for heartworms, said Christopher Rehm, a veterinarian who practices in Mobile, Alabama, and is president of the American Heartworm Society.
There are no solid figures on how many dogs heartworms kill each year, but untreated infections shorten a dog's lifespan.
Even if heartworm disease is caught and treated in time, it takes its toll on dogs. "Once they've ever had a heart infection, they're never the same," Rehm said.
Lyme disease
On top of being an enormous health hazard to humans, Lyme disease can harm dogs, causing lameness, fever and lethargy. It's carried primarily by the blacklegged tick, or deer tick, in the Northeast and the western blacklegged tick in the South.
Both are on the move.
"With Ixodes (blacklegged ticks) moving northward from the United States into Canada, it's a clear example of how things are changing," said Michael Yabsley, a professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Georgia in Athens.
Even as Lyme disease moves north, it's not decreasing in its historic area. In fact, infection rates in dogs are getting worse, said Yabsley, who studies wildlife diseases.
In 2018 in Columbia County, New York, 30% of dogs tested were positive for Lyme disease, according to data collected by the Companion Animal Parasite Council.

Pollen plague; How climate change is affecting every breath you take

melrose park, ill. From the roof of the Gottlieb Memorial Hospital in the Chicago suburbs, an 83-year-old retired doctor finds troubling evidence of why so many people are sneezing and itching their eyes.
Joseph Leija counts the pollen and mold spores that collect on slides inside an air-sucking machine atop the six-story building.
"There's been an increase, no doubt about it," he says of the 5 a.m. weekday counts that he's been doing as a volunteer for 24 years.
"My allergies are much worse than they used to be," says Amanda Carwyle, a mom of three who lives 95 miles south in Pontiac, Ill. "I used to be able to take a Benadryl or Claritin and be fine." Now, despite three medications and allergy shots that make her feel a bit like a zombie, she says her eyes are watery and her head stuffy. "I'm so miserable."
Climate change might be partly to blame. Scientists see a link to carbon dioxide, a heat-trapping greenhouse gas emitted by burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels. Tests show that the more CO2 in the atmosphere, the more plants generally grow and the more pollen they produce.
Though some plants grow more food or flowers as a result, more pollen can spell trouble. Doctors say it's contributing to a rise in seasonal hay fever and allergic asthma in the USA, where the pollen season has lengthened up to 16 days since 1995. If carbon dioxide emissions continue to increase, they expect allergic conditions probably will worsen, adding to the discomfort of allergy suffers as well as swelling U.S. health care costs.
USA TODAY traveled to Chicago, which recently ranked as the sixth worst U.S. city for ragweed sensitivity, as the fourth stop in a year-long series to explore places where climate change is changing lives.
"We've definitely seen a big increase in patients," says allergist Brian Rotskoff, whose Clarity Allergy Center has offices a half-hour drive from where Leija counts pollen. He says some kids are coming in at younger ages, and some adults are having worse symptoms or problems for the first time.
"The severity is affecting their quality of life," he says, noting they're having trouble sleeping and focusing at work or school. Symptoms such as congestion, shortness of breath, coughing, runny nose, sneezing and itchy eyes result when an allergic person inhales an allergen such as pollen, a plant's sperm, and overreacts by releasing histamine.
Sakina Bajowala, an allergist in nearby North Aurora, says she's also seen more patients with respiratory allergies. She has a new adult patient who had been fine with over-the-counter medications but says "he's just miserable now."
THE CARBON CONNECTION
"The link between rising carbon dioxide and pollen is pretty clear," says Lewis Ziska, a weed ecologist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and a top researcher in the field.
His lab tests show that pollen production rises along with carbon dioxide. It doubled from 5 grams to 10 grams per plant when CO2 in the atmosphere rose from 280 parts per million (ppm) in 1900 to 370 ppm in 2000. He expects it could double again, to 20 grams, by 2075 if carbon emissions continue to climb. The world's CO2 concentration is about 400 ppm.
"I noticed something changing," says Leonard Bielory, an allergy and immunology expert at Rutgers University's Center for Environmental Prediction. He's been counting pollen in New Jersey for 27 years and initially wondered whether the spike was because of El Niño, a warm ocean current.
"I saw a trend as I did an analysis," he says, noting his counts in the past five years have been double that of any prior five-year period. In fact, this year's levels are the highest since he began. Bielory expects they could increase 20% to 30% by 2020.
He says last year's Superstorm Sandy exacerbated the problem by soaking the soil with so much water that even though April was dry, pollen has reached record local levels.
"There's clear evidence that pollen season is lengthening and total pollen is increasing," says George Luber, associate director for climate change at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "It's one of the ways climate change is already affecting your community."
A 2011 study by Ziska and Bielory found that the ragweed season, which peaks in the fall (trees peak in spring and grass in summer), got longer the farther north you go where temperatures have risen more in recent decades. So in  Oklahoma City, the season increased only one day from 1995 to 2009, but it jumped 16 days in Minneapolis and Fargo, N.D., and 27 days in Saskatoon, Canada.
Perhaps not surprisingly, more Americans are testing positive for allergies. Quest Diagnostics, which administers a blood test to detect allergies, found a 15% increase in ragweed sensitivity from 2005 to 2009. It says Chicago's rate was the sixth highest -- after Phoenix, Las Vegas, Dallas, Kansas City and Riverside, Calif. -- and one of every five Americans is allergic to ragweed in all U.S. regions except the Southeast and Pacific Northwest where fewer people are sensitive.
CDC allergy skin tests found increased sensitivity not only to ragweed but also to ryegrass, Bermuda grass and mold nationwide between two surveys that spanned an 18-year period, 1976 to 1994. The tests also showed more sensitivity to oak, except in the South. The study's authors say methodology changes might account for some, but not likely all, of the increase, which is consistent with that found in other countries.
A new CDC report suggests pediatric rates of hay fever, more common than drug or food allergies, remained stable from 1997 to 2011, based on interviews with parents. Co-author Lara Akinbami, a CDC pediatrician, says hay fever may still be increasing but, since its symptoms are similar to those of the common cold, parents may not recognize it as a seasonal allergy. They also might simply be treating it with over-the-counter medicines.
As for asthma, doctors say it's caused by many factors and exacerbated by pollen for the majority of asthmatics with allergic conditions. Federal data report a 17% increase in U.S. asthma prevalence from 2001 through mid-2012.
Asthma has become a "national epidemic" that affects one of every 12 people, or 56 million, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said this month.  Most pediatric cases involve allergies, primarily hay fever.
Luber says many Americans don't suffer directly, but they all pay: "There are substantial costs to the health care system (from allergic conditions) that we all carry."
Scientists agree that rising pollen counts aren't all bad. In some cases, they boost the production of corn and other crops.
"It's true that some plants will be able to grow in new places they couldn't before," says Kim Knowlton, a Columbia University professor of public health who focuses on climate impacts. She says global warming could mean fewer people die of cold-related deaths.
"On balance, the negatives outweigh the positives," she says, citing other health problems that could ensue. More illness and deaths are likely from wildfires, flooding, heat-related strokes and infectious diseases such as cholera, according to the U.S. government's third National Climate Assessment, a draft of which was released in January.
Aside from pollen, the report says climate change could increase other factors that contribute to respiratory allergies and asthma. It points to higher summertime ozone concentrations, which make it more difficult to breathe, as well as more heavy downpours and rising air temperatures, which foster the growth of indoor fungi and molds.
SUFFERING THE IMPACT
For Carol Leopold and her 13-year-old twin sons, the pollen count is personal. She says their allergies have worsened in the past couple of years and they hit their peak in May, when spring comes alive.
"Anything that blooms enervates us. It wears us down," says Leopold, 43. She takes an antihistamine every day. When she goes on her 5:30 a.m. runs along Prairie Path in Elmhurst, Ill, a Chicago suburb where she lives, she takes her inhaler along.
Donovan Gill, 3, one of Rotskoff's patients, started showing symptoms two years ago. "We'd go to the playground, and if there was a honey locust tree and little yellow pieces of pollen fell from it, he'd blow up like a balloon," says Donovan's mom, Rachel, who lives in Chicago. "His eyes would start to water and get red and swell."
She says his adenoids -- glands in the back of the nasal cavity that can become swollen -- were removed to help clear his airways. She has had to look extra hard for a preschool with clean, well-ventilated classrooms because, like many people with hay fever, Donovan reacts to mold.
Carwyle, 35, says she limits her exposure to pollen by staying mostly indoors during allergy season. "You try not to sleep with the window open," she says. Her 7-year-old son, who had only a few bad days last year, has just started allergy shots because of his sensitivity to -- in her words -- "anything that grows."
She says spring hit with a bang this year, as reflected in Leija's high counts of both tree and grass pollen. On a morning in mid-May, she recalls, "my whole car was coated with pollen."
CHALLENGES AHEAD
Researchers looking at how climate change will affect plants, pollen counts and health are the first to say there's a lot they don't know.
Bielory, for example, is doing EPA-funded research to try to figure out -- based on historical data as well as multiple factors such as wind patterns, precipitation and population growth -- how much pollen counts will probably rise.
In lab chambers, he's growing different weeds and grasses at three different temperatures and CO2 concentrations.
He's also looking at whether food allergies, in addition to hay fever, are affected by rising carbon dioxide emissions. He suspects they are.
"There are so many pieces of the puzzle, and it's not a flat puzzle. It's a 3-D puzzle," says Bielory, who says too few scientists study the connections. He devotes two days each week to research and spends the other three treating patients.
The puzzle has non-climate pieces, too. Researchers are looking at why more people are becoming allergic and finding links to chemicals and, perhaps counterintuitively, cleanliness.
The "hygiene hypothesis," backed by some but not all studies, suggests people are more prone to allergies and asthma when they're not exposed to germs early in life. Why? Their immune systems haven't learned what's dangerous, such as bacteria, so they overreact to allergens, which are otherwise harmless.
"All of these things are likely affecting us," says the CDC's Akinbami, but it's unclear which factors -- chemicals, hygiene, pollen -- have the most impact or what their relationship is to each other. She says the first two sensitize people and the third triggers their sensitivity.
On the pollen front alone, there are large gaps in the data, says the CDC's Luber, noting pollen counts are not done on weekends and don't cover every state. There's not a single pollen-counting station in Alaska, Hawaii or 16 other U.S. states.
In fact, the 76 U.S. stations (plus one in Puerto Rico) are run by volunteers trained and certified by the National Allergy Bureau, part of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI), a private organization that promotes research and treatment.
"There's no federal funding," says Linda Ford, an allergist who volunteers to do the count for the Omaha area as a way to help her patients. "There is no automated service for this," she says, adding it can take as long as two or three hours.
"This is very important for patients, " says Leija, who does the only count in Illinois. He says if they know pollen season is coming, they can start medications in advance to help control their symptoms.
That's why, even though he retired last year after working 53 years at the hospital as a general practitioner and allergist, he continues to rise before the sun and climb the stairs from the sixth floor to the roof -- rain or shine. When it's still dark outside, he wears a miner's head lamp.
"It's a hobby," Leija says as he removes a pollen and mold slide from the Burkard Spore Trap. The $5,000 device, which the AAAAI provides to counting stations, has a fan that draws air in at the same rate that people breathe.
He starts early, so he can decipher the amount and types of pollen, using a microscope on the third floor, in time for the 7 a.m. TV news. He knows that someday he'll have to hand off his sunrise routine. His wife is ailing, so he's been working alongside a nurse who's getting certified to carry on the count.
Changing Climate
Rising carbon dioxide may be  driving you right to your doctor's office. Here's one way climate  change affects your health:
1) Carbon dioxide is a heat-trapping   greenhouse gas that's   emitted when burning fossil fuels,   such as gasoline from your car.
2) The added CO2 in the atmosphere  stimulates plant growth.   And bigger plants in turn produce   more pollen. This creates a sniffly   mess for people who suffer from  allergies.
3)  In the early 20th century, CO2  concentrations were at 280 parts   per million and could reach 720  by 2075.
Early 1900s:         280  parts per million
Projected  2075:    720  parts per million
